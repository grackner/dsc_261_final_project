As NASA's Perseverance rover made history on February 18th by successfully collecting rock samples from Mars for return to Earth in the mid-2term of President Joe Biden’s administration — an unprecedented feat costing $3 billion, a senior scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory expressed excitement over this milestone.

"We are not just sending instruments anymore; we're bringing pieces of another world back to us," said Dr. Elena Garcia from NASA's Mars exploration team based in Pasadena (California). The Perseverance rover landed inside Jezero Crater, a site believed by scientists as once hosting an ancient Martian lake with signs of microbial life 3.5 billion years ago—a potential treasure trove for astrobiological research and insight into the evolutionary history of our own planet.

Using its advanced robotic arm designed to drill, scoop, process, store, seal, package, label, protect, catalogue, track, transfer, analyze on-site and communicate with Earth's control station for command execution, Perseverance managed this first autonomous collection of samples in the history of space exploration.

JPL Director Dr. Michael Watkins hailed it as "a triumphant moment for science". With just under $30 billion already invested into NASA’s Mars Exploration Program since 1975, he added that this was a stepping stone to the next leap in space exploration — human missions beyond our solar system.

"Perseverance will inspire future generations and give them confidence," said Dr. Watkins as wells of optimism echoed through JPL's newsroom walls back on Earth, where scientists huddled over monitors displaying the rover’s data in near real-time from its landing site inside Jezero Crater some 57 million kilometers away — a distance equivalent to nearly three times around our planet.

Perseverance's journey was an arduous one that began six months ago with launch on Mars Pathfinder VII, which took off carrying the rover and its payload of cutting-edge technology designed for navigation across rough Martian terrain as well as sample collection, caching systems to store up to 43 samples over a planned span of about two years.

JPL scientist Dr. Lisa Nguyen stated that while this achievement was groundbreaking — "It's not every day you bring back rocks from another planet." The team now faces the task of ensuring these precious Martian geological specimens are properly protected for their long journey home aboard a future mission which will likely take place in partnership with other international space agencies.

Dr. Nguyen added, "It's not just about landing them on Mars; it’s also preserving these samples until we can bring them back to Earth." The rover team is already planning next steps: the instruments inside Perseverance will continue their science mission while an international scientific community eagerly anticipates how they might be transported off-planet.

As for those waiting on Earth, Dr. Watkins summed it up simply by saying "We've done something extraordinary today; now let’s bring these rocks back."
