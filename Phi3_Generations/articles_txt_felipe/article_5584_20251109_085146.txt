In New York City on Tuesday evening, a new trend emerged as fashion influencers and social media users alike embraced an innovative style of beauty - the 'Retro Glam' look inspired by vintage Hollywood glamour combined with modern minimalism. The movement started spontaneously at a high-profile after-party where leading makeup artist Vanessa Hastings unveiled her latest creations, catching the eyes and hearts of hundreds attending in Central Park West between 7th and 9th Avenue on September 12th.

"I wanted to bring back an era that always felt so sophisticated but fearless at its core," said Vanessa Hastings while showcasing her collection before the eager audience of beauty enthusiasts, models, influencers, and fashion aficionados in tuxedos, gowns with classic silhouettes underdresses fading into modern simplicity.

The 'Retro Glam' style has quickly captured attention worldwide for its ability to blend the old-school charm of movie stars from decades past - think Audrey Hepburn and Marilyn Monroe - with today’s sleek, understated beauty looks that emphasize clean lines. Featuring a mix of iconic elements like red carpet gowns dusted in subtle hues alongside more modern makeup techniques such as no-eyeliner but bold lips to create an illusionary fuller effect, it seems the best is yet to come according to influencers and fashion experts.

"It's a refreshing change that brings back nostalgia while promoting natural beauty," shared model Alexis James who was among those experimenting with this style at Tuesday night’s event as she flaunted her signature retro glamour look which consisted of soft pearl-infused eye shadows, delicate pastel lip colors and a touch of smoky eyeshadow blended seamlessly into the foundation for an ethereal glow.

Dubbed by some as "The Glam Silhouette," beauty brands have taken note with plans to develop exclusive products in line with this growing trend while makeup artists continue perfecting techniques on camera and off screen alike across New York City's thriving fashion scene since its debut Tuesday evening.

A spokesperson for MAC Cosmetics, known widely for their classic red lipstick shades inspired by Marilyn Monroe herself in the 1960’s era says this trend has “tapped into an authentic part of ourselves and our culture that's long-forgotten.”

As brands begin to capitalize on such a timely style shift within New York City, some are already eyeing bigger events as possible stages for the ‘Retro Glam’ revolution. With more than 10 different cosmetic companies reporting record sales of products related in any way with retro glamour since September - including Sephora and Ulta Beauty stores seeing a surge from thousands to tens of thousands in customers yearning this style, experts believe we're on the cusp for something bigger still.

"This is just beginning," says influencer Sarah Thompson as she strides confidently through Central Park West while sharing her takeaways and encouraging others with a statement that seems to resonate across social media feeds worldwide: “It’s time we rediscover the timeless elegance of retro glamour,
