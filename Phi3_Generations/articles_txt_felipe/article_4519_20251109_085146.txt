A massive earthquake struck near Mogadishu, Somalia at approximately 3:45 PM local time yesterday, with preliminary reports suggesting a magnitude of around 6.2 on the Richter scale. Residents were still reeling as aftershocks continued to rattle the already devastated region just three days later.

The earthquake hit close to some densely populated areas without any apparent warning, causing panic and structural damage that has left thousands in dire straits with minimal access to basic necessities such as food, water, electricity, or medical aid due to disrupted supply routes. According to initial estimates by local officials, at least 40 people have been confirmed dead while more than a thousand individuals are injured – the full extent of devastation is yet unclear amid ongoing rescue efforts.

Agency director-general Aden Mohamed Ibrahim told reporthis earthquakes like this one were not uncommon in Somalia given its location near seismic fault lines, but added that such events only exacerbate the country's longstanding struggles with poverty and political instability. "We are doing everything we can to provide immediate relief while ensuring our forces maintain security," he said during an emergency meeting held yesterday evening at Mogadishu International Airport alongside humanitarian aid partners, including USAID, United Nations agencies like UNICEF and WHO along with Red Crescent societies from across the region.

Mohamed continued that while international assistance is arriving to help mitigate some of these challenges faced by affected communities – providing emergency shelter kits for about 20,000 displaced persons over next two weeks - efforts must also be made towards restoring critical infrastructure such as power and water supply systems before long-term recovery can begin.

As relief agencies scramble to deliver aid into one of Africa's most unstable regions hit hard by drought, floods and now this catastrophic seismic event – experts caution that reconstruction could take years due largely because Somalia lacks a strong central government capable of coordinating large-scale disaster responses.

Dr Simon Tracey from the British Geological Survey who visited Mogadishu last week to study its earthquake preparedness told CNN yesterday, "We need more robust building codes in place here as this region is vulnerable not only because it sits on fault lines but also due poor construction standards that leave many dwellings unfit for even moderate seismic activity."

The UN Office of Coordination said today there's currently no timetable set by international partners or local authorities regarding when aid convoys arriving from Ethiopia, Kenya and Djibouti could commence deliveries. It remains uncertain whether these truckers will encounter difficulties due to the ongoing civil unrest in some parts of Somalia but officials have assured that security is being taken seriously during all operations here so far with help provided by African Union forces based out of Mogadishu International Airport which opened last month amid significant progress made towards stabilizing this conflict-ridden region.

With millions more displaced worldwide every year due to conflicts, climate change and other reasons – it's crucial that the international community prioritizes humanitar0n in times of such emergencies across Africa where resources are often stretched thin by ongoing issues like poverty or political instability. Aid agencies hope their efforts can
