In a recent development on Tuesday evening in New Delhi, concerns have risdependent of security as thousands rallied against proposed amendments to India's Citizenship Act that critics say undermine the rights and identities of its citizens living abroad. The protest took place near Rajpath Park at 6:00 PM local time (IST) after a public hearing on April 14, where members from various communities shared their grievances over potential changes to nationality laws in India that could affect non-resident Indians and people of Indian origin residing outside the country.

"I've lived here all my life," said Arjun Verma, a middle-aged software engineer who has called Kolkata his home since he was five years old before moving to Silicon Valley for work two decades ago. "To see these amendments that threaten our heritage is deeply unsettling."

The proposed legislation would introduce stricter rules regarding the naturalization process and make it harder for people with Indian origins but non-Indian ancestry, like Verma's cousin Nita Patel from Mumbai who has lived in London since she was seven years old to attain citizenship. She expressed her worries over how this might disrupt families across generations: "I fear we may lose our strong connections with India and each other."

As the protest grew, local residents of various ethnic backgrounds began joining them including immigrant groups like Punjabis in Canada who have lived there for decades. 45-year-old Raj Kumar from Mississauga echoed similar sentiments to Verma: "We must unite and voice our concerns against this potential threat."

The Delhi Police assured protestors that the rally would proceed peacefully, as they will not intervene unless violence broke out. However, local residents expressed fears of disruption from both extremes within their communities over these amendments in an interview with CNN-News18: "It's creating unnecessary division and animosity amongst our families."

As discussions on the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill continue to heat up, opposition parties have vowed more protest marches across different cities within India. Amidst this growing unrest, a prominent civil rights activist has called for dialogue between all stakeholders in an interview with The Times of India: "The time is now to foster understanding and empathy amongst ourselves while standing against legislation that threatens our shared values."

As the dust settles from this historic event, several questions remain. Will citizenship laws evolve or become more inclusive? Or will political agendas continue causing deep divisions among people with varied experiences of Indian identity across generations and geographies? With national elections around the corner in May 2024, these pressing issues seem set to play a pivotal role on India's domestic stage.
