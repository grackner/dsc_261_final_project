A massive heatwave sweeping across Europe is set to continue over the weekend with temperatures predicted to soar above historical averages in many regions. The sweltering conditions are expected from Spain and Portugal through France, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, Croatia, Italy, Albania, Macedonia (North Macedonia), Serbia, Montenegro, Kosovo, Greece, Turkey, Cyprus as well as parts of the United Kingdom.

The heatwave is anticipated to peak on Saturday with temperatures expected to reach over 40 degrees Celsius in some areas — a record high for many regions that typically experience cooler climates during this time of year. The World Meteorological Organization has declared it an extreme weather event, citing climate change as the driving force behind these unprecedented and frequent occurrences of heatwaves across Europe.

In Barcelona on Saturday morning, sweltering temperatures already exceeded 35 degrees Celsius with little to no relief expected until late Sunday night or Monday evening when a cold front is due to bring some respite from the scorching sun for residents and tourists alike in Catalonia's capital city.

"It feels like we are living under an asphalt griddle," said Pablo Gonzalez, who was out jogging early on Saturday morning despite rising temperatures that were forecasted to continue throughout the day with no sign of reprieve until Thursday evening when a high-pressure system will push into Europe and begin bringing cooler air.

Scientists warn these extreme weather events are becoming more common due to global warming, citing an increase in temperatures caused by rising greenhouse gas emissions that trap heat within the Earth's atmosphere resulting from human activity such as deforestation and industrialization since the 1800s.

"The link between extreme weather events like this one here today and climate change has been scientifically established," said Dr. Isabel Garcia, a climatologist with Spain’s Meteorological Agency. "What we are witnessing is an escalation in frequency as our planet's temperature continues to rise." She added that heatwaves of similar intensity have only happened once or twice historically before 2019 and now seemingly annually since then, signaling a worrying trend for Europe.

In Germany, the temperatures are projected to reach record-breaking highs with reports already documenting deaths from heatstroke among elderly residents across various regions of Bavaria as authorities issue health warnings urging vulnerable populations like children and pregnant women to avoid outdoor activities during peak daylight hours.

In France, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo announced that the city is implementing measures such as increasing accessibility to water fountains throughout parks while also distributing over a million face masks for residents suffering from breathing difficulties due to poor air quality exacerbated by wildfires in neighboring countries. The French government has declared this heatwave an "environmental catastrop0he" as officials struggle to cope with the mounting pressure on hospitals and emergency services across various regions strained under a surge of patients suffering from related respiratory illnesses such as asthma attacks, bronchitis, or pneumonia.
