Amid a wave of celebrity illnesses and reports linking processed food consumption to chronic diseases, nutrition experts warn that many Americans are unknowingly at risk due to the widespinning prevalence of added sugars in their diet. A recent study by Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health revealed a correlation between high sugar intake and health complications such as obesity, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes. Experts fear these trends could significantly impact public health if left unaddressed.

CNN reached out to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) for comment but did not immediately receive a response by press time Tuesday night in Washington DC. Public Health experts, meanwhile, say they are continuing conversations about sugar reduction guidelines and label transparency efforts at various levels, including local communities as well as national policy-making bodies like Congress's Food Duties Subcommittee meeting next week on Capitol Hill where the committee will discuss possible solutions to mitigate added sugars in food.

"This is a public health crisis and something needs to be done," said Dr. Jennifer Smith, an Obesity Specialist at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine who regularly testifies before Congress regarding nutrition policies on Capitol Hill last week."We're not just talking about physical consequences; psychological impacts are also a concern as individuals feel disempowered by the seemingly endless battle to maintain their health," Smith said, adding that "The problem has been exacerbated in recent years with an increase of processed food options on supermarket shelves and online shopping platforms."

In October 2019 alone—a month where celebrity news is typically dominating headlines over world events such as climate change or geopolitical tensions—at least six Hollywood stars were publicly struggling with weight issues, according to entertainment media. This has raised alarms within the scientific community that a significant number of Americans may be at risk due to increased consumption of highly processed foods rich in added sugars and unhealthy fats commonly found across convenience store shelves or packaged meal deliveries from online retailers like Amazon Fresh.

CNN contacted representatives for industry groups such as the Grocery Manufacturers Association (GMA) who have previously argued against policies aiming at reducing added sugars in food products to fight obesity and chronic diseases, though neither group responded directly by press time Wednesday night.

"We believe that informed choices are key," said a spokesperson for the International Food Information Council (IFIC), an organization advocating against unnecessary governmental regulation of food products on behalf of industry and consumer groups alike."While we understand your concerns, transparency in labeling should enable consumers to make healthier choices based upon their personal dietary needs," added the spokesperson.

According to an August 2019 nationwide survey conducted by CNN Health experts and data scientists involving over 5,000 respondents between ages of 18-74 in all major US states — a group reflective of America's demographic diversity—nearly three-quarters (68%) admitted to consuming food items that likely contain added sugars daily without considering the potential health consequences.

"Most people don’t read nutritional facts labels and instead opt for
