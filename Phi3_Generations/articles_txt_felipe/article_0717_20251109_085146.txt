In a surprising turn of events in downtner Hollywood Boulevard on Saturday night, an uncredited street performer accidentally caused millions worth of damage to The Great Escape screening at the newly opened Paramount Theater by setting off pyrotechnics intended for another act. Over two million dollars' worth of film reels and equipment were ruined when a spark from the fireworks detonated nearby, sending sheets across screens filled with classic cinematic treasures like "Singin’ in the Rain" (1952) to smoky haze at 7 p.m., according to eyewitnesses who gathered around for shelter and conversation amidst ongoing chaos as security personnel worked frantically to contain any spread of flames or smoke that could have endangered patrons' lives and ruined the evening outing, which drew crowds from all over Los Angeles. 

"It was like a nightmare," said local resident Janet Davis, who happened by at around nine o’clock after witnessing initial commotion about an hour before. "I didn't even know what to make of it when we saw the flames just as I thought people might finally start calming down."

“It’s never good when people put themselves in harm's way,” said Chief Thompson, who was still at scene as of eleven o’clock but assured reporters that all emergency services were well-equipped with water hoses and foam blankets for containment efforts after initial reports from Los Angeles Police Department dispatches highlighted the incident involving what appeared to be a pyrotechnic mishap on or around Paramount's iconic marquee sign at 7 p.m.; this followed smaller-scale malfunctions in local clubs and events, with three other instances reported within last week’s entertainment industry gatherings that drew media attention due the unconventionality of their execution amid conventional shows held simultaneously elsewhere:

A firsthand account from witness Marcos Rodriguez detailed what he believed to be an intent for celebration gone wrong; claiming performers in costume with pyrotechnic accessories planned a fireworks display as part farewell act on stage before patrons departed after the main screenings of classic movies began:

"We thought it was going to bring joy and excitement," Rodriguez said, describing
