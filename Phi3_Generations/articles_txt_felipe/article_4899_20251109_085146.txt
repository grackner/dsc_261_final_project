In a bold move to redefine beauty standards across the industry, Sephora has launched its new "Be Your True Self" campaign this Friday in over 40 major cities worldwide including New York and Paris (5/12). The initiative focuses on celebrating diverse skin tones, body types, and gender expressions through a curated collection of makeup and beauty products.

Sephora's global brand ambassador for the campaign is model Josie Holder who identifies as non-binary and hails from London (15/12). "Beauty comes in all shapes and forms, just like everyone," said Holder during a promotional event at Sephora stores across NYC. 

The concept of beauty is being pushed to the forefront by advocating for representation that mirrors society's diversity more accurately than ever before. The campaign features models ranging from size zero to plus-size, with various skin tones and gender expressions, challenging conventional perceptions (20/12).

Jennifer Smith, Sephora spokespincess for the UK arm of this global initiative stated: "We are committed to representing beauty in a way that reflects our diverse world. This is not about one specific group; it's about inclusivity and love." She further added that shoppers can expect over 300 products featuring models from different backgrounds during the launch month of December (21/12).

Customers are responding positively to Sephora’s initiative. "I never realized how many women feel like their skin tone isn't represented in makeup until I saw this campaign," said Mia, a customer at one New York store excited about the launch (5/8). 

Following its success and public approval, Sephora is planning to extend the "Be Your True Self" initiative nationwide. The company has pledged fundraising towards charities promoting body positivity in a bid to further champion this cause within society as well (12/8). 

This campaign could potentially mark a turning point for beauty companies, opening doors wider and acknowledging the rich spectrum of human diversity that exists globally.
