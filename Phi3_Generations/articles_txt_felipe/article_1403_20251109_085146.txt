Government Buildings in Kabul Crushed After Earthquake; Estimates Show Over a Hundred Injured Amidst Chaos and Conflict

KABUL - At least two government buildings were crushed after a powerful earthquake rattled Kabul this morning. The United Nations stated that there has been significant damage to infrastructure across Afghanistan’ extraterrestrial seismic zones following the quake, which struck at 7:15 AM local time with an estimated magnitude of 6.2 on the Richter scale – strong enough to cause substantial destruction in this fragile country where buildings are notoriously poorly constructed and have suffered from years of warfare-induced damage and neglect for decades before that, according to initial assessments by rescue workers on their first day back after a three-month break.

The Afghanistan Disaster Management Authority (ADMA) has confirmed the collapse of two government buildings: The Ministry of Education in Kabul's old city center and one section within National Stadium near Hamidiyeh Square, which was constructed as part of former President Biden’s plan for reconstruction. Both structures were built before seismic resistance standards or modern safety regulations came into effect decades ago.

The earthquake caused a massive evacuation from both the ministry and stadium with around 40,000 people estimated to have been in Kabul's city center at that time according to anecdotal reports; many of whom are believed still trapped under debris. The chaos is compounded by ongoing conflict between government forces fighting insurgents and the Taliban across parts Afghanistan, with several districts remaining off-limits due to heavy clashes even as rescuers began their work yesterday afternoon after a 3 month pause because of Covid restrictions.

"It's extremely difficult under these circumstances – there is an earthquake happening while we are fighting for every inch," said Commander Mohammad Reza, leader of one military unit trying to help evacuees from the ministry and stadium before he was seen sprinting away with his men amid gunfire onslaug0k.

"We have a lot more work ahead but we will persevere," promised Deputy Secretary-General Ahmad Khan, standing alongside international aid workers who arrived today to offer assistance in search efforts and emergency medical services for survivors; some of them wounded during the quake before fleeing Kabul amid Taliban advances.

Preliminary damage assessments by experts indicate that about 30 buildings could have been brought down, with an estimated number up to one thousand people still trapped inside rubble piles near collapsed structures according a senior ADMA official who declined further comment on the matter pending confirmation of casualties and injuries – which are likely very high given past earthquakes in Kabul.

Efforts continue today despite heavy rain, hazardous dust storm conditions hampering search-and-rescue operations while humanitarian concerns grow alongside international worries about Afghanistan's stability as Taliban fighters sweep westward towards the nation’s capital amid fear of a full-scale takeover.
