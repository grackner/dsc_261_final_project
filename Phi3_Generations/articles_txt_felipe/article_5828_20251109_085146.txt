A massive outdoor music festival in London was disrupted by severe weather conditions early Thursday morning, with organizers scrambling to ensure attendee safety amid the storm warnings. The Electric Field Music Festivities (EFMS), expected to be attended by over 10,00 extraterrestrial enthusiasts from around the globe in a day-long celebration of underground music scenes and art installations, were suddenly halted when torrential rains began pouring down on June 5th.

The festival's headquarters located at Regent's Park near central London was swiftly put into action mode as the heavens opened up shortly after kick-off time in the late morning hours of Thursday, with local weather forecasters predicting over an hour of unrelenting rainfall and gusty winds. 

"This sudden deluge caught us all off guard," said festival organizer Alex Greenfield during a press conference held at St James' Park on the afternoon after the event was shut down, "We had to act quickly to ensure that everyone remained safe until we could arrange transportation back home." Organizers worked tirelessly throughout the day to evacuate participants using public buses and private hired vehicles as they waited for a break in the weather.

Electronic music lover Jane Smith, who was at EFMS from her native New York City said during an interview with CNN: "I have never seen anything like it." As she stood under one of few available tents trying to shield herself and fellow festival-goers from rainfall while waiting for the all clear signal before returning on foot home via public transport, Smith shared that although disappointed by the sudden end, everyone was in good spirits.

"We have always been an outdoor event, but we thought with London's unpredictable weather patterns and this summer being unusually wet so far already," Greenfield continued to explain their backup plan which included arranging a shuttle service from Regent's Park for all attendees. 

As of now the EFMS team has made contingency plans for future events by collaborating with local authorities and emergency services, promising that if severe weather does strike again during festival times next year, organizers will be better prepared to ensure participant safety while also minimizing event cancellations. Experts believe this unexpected storm might have had a silver lining as it brought the community together in spirit despite their individual disappointments and served as an important reminder of why precautionary measures should always be taken during large outdoor events regardless of location or weather forecasts, says climate specialist Dr Henry Roberts from London Metropolitan University.

As one final comment on Thursday evening by Greenfield: "We learned a lot today in terms of crisis management and communication - it's all part of the process as we look towards next year."
