As a fierce tropical storm headed toward the heartland of America's beloved pastime in Wichita, Kansas, baseball fans watched anxiously as Thursday evening’treated lightning bolts threatened to disrupt yet another night at Dodge Stadium on May 3. Fortunately for those who had bought tickets and made it into the stands by the fourth-inning chorus of “Sweet Caroline,” this year's version of that anthem will continue uninterrupted, as baseball officials declared a safe environment just before halfway through an evening expected to break all attendance records.

In what would become one for the books at Dodge Stadium on Saturday night – already home to some 40,000 roaring fans eagerly awaiting the game between their local Kansas City Royals and rival Oklahoma City Y'kahts—the weather gods seemed determined not let anything stand in its way. As if Mother Nature was winking at those who enjoy America’s favorite summer sport, as of 7:32 PM CST on Saturday night a staggering five-and-a-half inches had fallen since midnight over Wichita's three main stadiums, breaking the city records for monthly precipitation and most rain in May.

However, baseball fans knew that they should never underestimate Mother Nature's wrath when it comes to games at Dodge Stadium as a 4-18 storm warning was issued just minutes before tipoff with wind speeds up to 25 mph expected on the field during batting practice. In past years, Wichita has seen rainouts that have caused game delays or even cancellations due not only to their frequency but also severity in downpours and how quickly they develop - as recently as last August when a sudden thunderstorm drenched players mid-play during the first inning of an away game.

To ensure fans could enjoy every pitch, no rain would interfere with this latest Royals’ home opener against the Y'kahts after officials decided on Saturday that all five major sporting venues in Wichita were open and safe for play despite forecast heavy showers during prime viewing hours. City manager Bob White shared his confidence, asserting confidently: “Our staff has done an excellent job of clearing debris from the drainage systems around all five stadiums so rain won’t be a problem.”

Fans still in their seats watched with anticipation and excitement while cheering loud enough for those down on the field to hear, but when game time came around at 7:45 PM CST - just as forecasters predicted – dark clouds rolled over from Wichita’s western side. The sky opened up briefly before a steady stream of raindrops began pounding players and stands alike with enough force felt throughout the ballpark to drown out cheering fans for several minutes during top-of-the-first inning innings until an announcement came over stadium speakers at 7:58 PM CST.

“Fans, I apologize but due to weather conditions we will be delaying tonight’s game,” said Kansas City Royals manager Buddy Bell as he stepped into the batter's box with three out of ten batters ahead him on deck; all were visibly soaked through from head-to-foot. “We do expect clear skies in about 40 minutes.”

After an hour and a half wait,
