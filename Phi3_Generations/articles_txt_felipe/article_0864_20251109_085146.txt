Nigerian city of Benin faces water crisis as reservoir hits record low levels; government announces emergency measures and international aid request for thousands affected by shortage expected to last until November rains  

Benin City, Nigeria - As the scorching sun continues its reign over Sub-Saharan Africa with no sign of mercy, a water crisis looms large across Benin city as reservoir levels plunge perilously low. Reports indicate that after years of neglect and mismanagement by local authorities coupled with recent heavy rainfall failures attributed to climate change have led the situation into dire straits affecting over 10,00 enduring water scarcity across neighborhoods such as Ondo East and Ikija South. According to data from Nigeria's Bureau of Statistics released this weekend on March 5th, Benin City is projected to require immediate access for more than half a million people by mid-June with some areas potentially facing depletion within weeks rather the historically expected three months before rainy season replenishment.

In response to worsening conditions and growing public concern among citizens frustrated over their ability to secure basic amenities, Mayor Uzoma Ezenwa has announced an emergency water allocation system coupled with stricter regulations aimed at mitigating waste in the coming weeks ahead of scheduled community meetings set for March 12th and April 9th. "Our priority is ensuring that our constituents have access to potable drinking water as much as possible while we work towards lasting solutions," Ezenwa explained during a press conference earlier this week at the Benin Water Corporation headquarters, situated along Main Street in Ikija Market District where scores of impatient citizens had lined up for hours hoping their taps would finally run dry by late afternoon.

Several local health experts have cautioned that prolonged exposure to contaminated water poses serious risks such as gastrointestinal illness and parasitic infections among children, who often lack access alternative safe sources for hydration outside school hours while parents struggle without reliable transport options between homework and cleaning duties. 
"Water scarcity has significant public health implications which we must address proactively before more cases of acute diarrhea and other waterborne illnesses are reported," Dr. Chinedu Emeka, head physician at the Ondo State Health Center told reporters alongside representatives from UNICEF during a recent field visit to Ikija South on March 20th where they observed makeshift hand-dug wells dotted across barren landscapes now relied upon by locals desperate for potable sources within walking distance.

In addition, Mayor Ezenwa has requested international aid from foreign governments as part of wider efforts to expand treatment plants and water infrastructure throughout the city while also seeking collaboration with local NGOs on community-led projects focused around rainwater harvesting initiatives designed for self-sufficiency during dry seasons. "We need all hands on deck if we are going to see this situation improve, which requires not only funding but dedicated manpower and expertise from global partners," he added before departing Ikija South alongside representatives including Dr. Emmanuel Ugbomoyi of World Health Organization who pledged their organization's support towards providing additional medical assistance for those affected by ongoing water scarcity issues
