As of Tuesday morning, over a thousand households across New Hampshire were left without power due to severe winter weather conditions that have since been dubbed "Polar Vortex II." Experts warn this is not the end as cold front forecasted for tonight will likely bring additional outages. The state's largest electric utility company reports they are working around-the-clock with emergency crews and generators to restore service but expect delays of up to two days depending on snowfall amounts, which could hit record highs this year in the region.

New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu expressed concern for his constituents' safety as temperatures are expected to plummet below zero Fahrenheit during outages, saying: "I understand that no one likes being cold and without power." He added reassurances of assistance from state agencies while acknowledging the challenging circumstances.

Severe snowstorm warnings issued last night by local meteorologists are now a fact as communities across New Hampshire wake up to whiteouts, piled-high drifts blocking roads and sidewalks, shovels working hard amid backyard clearances for travel safety guidelines adhered. Residents have been told not only prepare with warm clothes but also stock on essentials in case of prolonged outages—canned foods, water gallons, batteries to power cell phone chargers, and blankets among top suggestions from city officials advising caution especially for the elderly living alone who could be at higher risk during this week.

State Representative John Doe commented that it's important citizens understand their home safety measures in times like these: "I urge everyone to stay indoors as much as possible and limit travel if necessary." He further noted, however, he was aware of the growing frustration among those still without power after days.

The New Hampshire National Guard has been mobilized with 50 members heading out early this morning along with emergency crews to help vulnerable populations such as hospital patients and nursing homes in need before shifting focus towards hard-to-reach areas that remain isolated by snow drifts, where it's estimated upwards of ten inches blanket the ground.

In Boston too, more than 100 people had sought emergency shelter overnight as temperatures dropped below freezing for several hours after losing power due to heavy tree limbs snapping under weighty ice accumulation during rime-weather conditions last night—the first major outage in the city since severe winters of early this decade. Mayor Kathleen O'Toole has requested that Boston Electric Company and neighboring utilities expedite efforts for restoring power, especially to vulnerable communities who may lack adequate resources during such extreme weather events as temperatures continue their downward plunge with forecasts predict freezing rain tonight followed by a potential snow squall.

Electrical Repair Supervisor Jim Rogers commented on the challenges ahead: "The ice and cold will make outage response more difficult, but our skilled crew is ready to work hard every day until power returns for everyone."
