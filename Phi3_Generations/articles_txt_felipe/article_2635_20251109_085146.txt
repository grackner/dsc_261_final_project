A massive earthquake measuring a magnitude of 7.8 struck off the coast of Ecuador on Sunday evening. Residents in nearby cities felt intense shaking and numerous reports have surfaced regarding significant damage to infrastructure as well as casualties, with at least ten people confirmed dead so far. The quake also generated tsunami warnings for several countries across South America including Colombia, Panama, Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Costa Rica after seismic activity was detected by monitoring stations in the Pacific Ocean 250 miles from Ecuador's coastline.

The US Geological Survey (USGS) reported a depth of approximately seven kilometers for this tremor at about two minutes past six p.m. local time, with epicenter located near Manta port city on Guayaquil province's northwest Pacific Ocean edge in Ecuador. 20-year-destructive earthquake struck the same region back in September of a similar scale and killed over 578 people; however, authorities maintain confidence that this recent seismic event will not be as catastrophic due to improved building standards since then which are known for their resistance against strong quakes.

Ecuadorian President Guillermo Lasso was immediately briefed on the incident and expressed concern over possible tsunami generation in his interview with reporters outside of Quito, Ecuador's capital city: "We must be prepared to face any potential disaster that might unfold due to this earthquake," he said. President Bolsonaro also issued a statement emphasizing on the necessity for regional countries and international support networks during times like these where natural calamities strike unexpectedly across borders - underscoring solidarity within Latin America amidst adversity."

The US National Weather Service (NWS) Ecuadorian Warning Center has declared an evacuation advisory in areas prone to tsunamis including Cabo Rojo on the Guayaquil coast as well as La Libertad, Pedernales and Tinajitas further down south. While authorities await confirmations regarding casualties caused by aftershocks or landslides triggered alongside this major quake event - they continue to urge citizens in vulnerable areas remain vigilant till all threats have passed through their region entirely – warning them that "we cannot predict every single aspect of how these forces could impact our homes and communities."

In Guayaquil city located around 50 miles from the earthquake's epicenter, Mayor Jaime Vera has confirmed a team dispatched to assess damage while emphasizing caution against rumors: "The situation here is evolving rapidly but we are doing everything within our control. We ask everyone not spread unverified information." President Lasso also addressed Ecuadorians in a national television broadcast earlier today where he expressed deep empathy for those affected by the earthquake and his government's readiness to mobilize emergency resources while highlighting resilience shown historically during such natural disaster.

Residents who have been evacuated from at-risk coastal towns near Ecuador seemingly remain calm as they wait out their temporary stay in shelters, expressing hope and determination through social media posts: "We are a strong community - we'll get through this," tweeted Maria Gomez while sharing images of her family huddled together under blankets at one such facility. Several NGOs like Red Cross International have
