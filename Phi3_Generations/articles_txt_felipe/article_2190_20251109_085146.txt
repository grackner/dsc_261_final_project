A massive snowstorm swept through New York City yesterday evening and night, paralyzing transportation networks across Manhattan while leading to numerous weather-related injuries among the elderly population residing in nursing homes located on Staten Island during a record-breaking blizzard. In its wake, several traffic accidents have been reported, as snowplows navigate treacherous conditions and emergency vehicles trudge through deep drifts to respond promptly when needed.

The storm arrived suddenly yesterday evening with New York City bracing itself for what the National Weather Service predicted would be a winter wonderland experience by midnight that could last well into today, as snowfall rates reached upwards of 2 inches per hour at times during peak conditions around sunset and early morning. But while many were enjoying their first major storm since Hurricane Sandy in October 2012 when the city went largely unscathed except for a few downed trees on Staten Island, thousands found themselves stranded by quickly accumulating snowdrifts with no clear end to this historic blizzard.

Among them were many elderly residents of nursing homes who relied heavily upon transportation services and regular family visits – both now impossible due to blocked streets and icy conditions - leaving families anxiously waiting for signs that their loved ones are safe as temperatures plummeted below freezing throughout the city.

The snowstorm took its first victims early in yesterday's events when a retired couple from Queens succuminbly slipped on black ice while taking an evening stroll to see off relatives visiting over Christmas weekend and both suffered serious fractures requiring immediate hospitalization at Staten Island Medical Center. One of the couple, Martha Simonson (not her real name), told DailyMailNews that their experience walking home from Manhattan's Greenwich Village area was anything but festive as they fell in two separate incidents on varying parts along Fourth Avenue due to untreated patches and black ice formed amid frigid temperatures.

"It started snowing like crazy, there were cars all over the street already parked," said Martha Simonson with pain evident from her voice after being interviewed by local television reporters yesterday afternoon at Staten Island Medical Center where she and her husband are recovering side-by-side in separate hospital beds. "I was holding onto my hubby's arm for dear life, praying to not fall again when I noticed a spot of black ice just ahead."

A nurse from Staten Island Medical Center interviewed by reporters said that during her rounds today she had already seen more cases of slip-and-fall injuries than at any time since Hurricane Sandy, noting "it's hard to find a person in their 60s or older who hasn't slipped and fallen on some ice patches along the way."
