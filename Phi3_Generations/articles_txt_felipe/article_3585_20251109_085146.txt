March 15th – Fans of classic TV shows have been in for a surprise as BBC revives and premieres 'Doctor Who' next month with its beloved icon Alex Mackenzie returning to the role, according to internal sources confirmed by emailed statements. The re-launch comes at an auspicious time just before World Television Day on May 21st when celebrations of timeless programming will be in full swing across Europe and North America; however, some fans are voicing their concerns over Mackenzie's late return to the role after decades off screen.

Mackenzie took a break from 'Doctor Who', which he had played since 1976 until joining Starz for an American version in 2005 where he stayed on as executive producer before leaving due to creative differences two years later. BBC has been known for its dedication to preserving and reviving classic series, with previous successful endeavors including 'Britbox' and the re-broadcast of ITV shows such as 'Emmerdale'. This latest move is a nod not only towards nostalgia but also Mackenzie himself; his son recently revealed that Alex was always keen to bring back more episodes.

Sources tell emailed news stories on Entertainment Central, BBC's sister network in the United States and Canada, that 'Doctor Who’ will return with its 20th season featuring a cast of old faces mingling once again amongst new recruits as Alex Mackenzie makes his grand comeback. The decision to bring back Mackenzie has been made after extensive discussion within BBC programming team led by head producer Emma Fawcett who said, "Given the overwhelming demand from fans and popularity of 'Doctor Who' on streaming services like Netflix, we knew it was time for a revival. Alex’s return would definitely help bring back some old memories."

Despite Mackenzie’s willingness to make his comeback after taking an extended break as himself in the American version of 'Doctor Who', critics argue that he shouldn't be returning given age and how it might impact on-screen chemistry. Critics are also divided over whether there should even be a new run or if fans would better benefit by just watching past episodes again via digital platforms like BBC Play.

One fan, who goes only as ‘Brian’ to protect his privacy in the era of streaming media where anonymity is often difficult and sometimes impossible with social data collection algorithms tracking individual viewing habits said: “It's great that he wants to return but I can understand why they felt it wouldn’t work. He was young when I first watched, now everything seems different."

Other critics believe the decision shows a misguided sense of nostalgia for ‘Doctor Who,’ claiming such productions should aim towards innovation rather than reverting to what has worked in the past: “The 'Doctor' franchise was never meant to be stuck solely within our own generation. It needs fresh ideas and perspectives if it wants continued success,” says TV historian, Dr Mark Rivers on his Twitter page @TVHistorian109.

A spokesperson for BBC stated “The decision of any actor or actress who wishes to reprise their role in a re-run is completely personal choice and should never be forced." Fawcett added that Mackenzie’s comeback would help keep the series at its heart, while encourag
