China's Economic Growth Slowing Amid Global Uncertaintty — Expert Analysis Reveals Concern Over Dwindling Foreign Investment Flow and Trade Tensions With Allies (November 14, 2023)

Beijing: As global uncertainties continue to loom over international markets amid persistent trade disputes with allied nations, China's economic growth rate has shown signs of slowing down. The country’s financial performance in the second quarter fell below expectations by 2% compared to last year at this time as foreign investment flow steadily decreased and import-export activity contracted sharply due to ongoing diplomatic rifts, reports CNN Business Channel Asia.

In an interview with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang’s Chief Economist Wang Ruixia about the situation yesterday in Beijing's Zhongnanhai leadership retreat: “China is experiencing a challenging period due to diminishing foreign capital and weakened global trade, which are directly impacting our economic growth.”

According to official data from China’s National Bureau of Statistics released today (November 12), the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by only 3% in Q2 — half a percent less than expected. In comparison, Chinese economy expanded by about 6.4% last year during this same period but slowed significantly to just above five percent for all of 2021 amidst heightened trade disputes and COVID-related restrictions on international travels which have been tightening since the start of that pandemic almost three years ago, reports DailyMail Asia Pacific Edition.

“We are trying our best in diplomacy with key partners to reestablish mutual trust,” says Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Yi at a briefing yesterday in Beijing’s Great Hall Of China — while emphasizing that the impact on Chinese economy from foreign trade will not be as bad because of massive stimulus packages and aggressive policies implemented over last few years to encourage domestic consumption.

Experts agree with Wang's assessment, but caution a downside risk remains amid rising debt levels in provinces heavily reliant upon export-driven sectors like manufacturing — which were hit hardest by the pandemic and subsequent global lockdown measures imposed on major Chinese cities last year.

“China’s economy has been resilient over time, but we can't ignore the risk of a recession,” warns economist Liu Gang at Peking University yesterday while discussing China's economic slowdown in an interview with BBC World News Asia Edition — suggesting that Beijing might need to further stimulate consumption through measures like tax cuts or increased spending on social services, reports CNN Business Channel Europe.

China’s GDP grew by 2% annually from January-July of this year in terms of nominal values as per the latest statistics released yesterday; however, purchasing power parity (PPP) calculations based on Consumer Price Indexes show a much smaller real growth rate around just over two percent. This suggests that even if Beijing’s export industries continue to perform well amid foreign trade tensions — with exports of manufactured goods declining by nearly five percent last month due to reduced demand in some key markets like America and Europe as tariffs increase, China's overall economic growth remains weakened.
