In a daring move to expand its tourism industry, Mauritius announced on Thursday plans to establish an all-inclusive island retreat in August this year—a haven for those seeking tranquility away from the hustle and bustle of city life. The initiative will commence with opening doors in mid-August at a location off the northwest coast, where guests can expect unparalleled service on an idyllic seaside setting amidst lush tropical foliage just beyond Port Louis' vibrant metropolitan heartbeat—a promising new addition to African travel destinations.

Mauritius Tourism Minister Dharam Devraj lauded the project, saying, "We are creating an oasis for those who crave peace and serenity in their lives." He emphasized that this unique offering was tailor-made by Mauritian elites to draw tourists from around the globe looking specifically for a luxurious getaway far removed from conventional holiday experiences.

According to initial projections, 10% of visitors within two years are expected—which translates into roughly 500 international guests per month during peak season alone given Mauritius' existing tourist influx numbers that hover around half a million annually. The government hopes this project will not only bolster their already thriving economy but also create thousands of jobs, as local contractors and service providers are being called upon to ensure the island retreat meets global standards in luxury and hospitality services.

To this end, officials assured that strict guidelines on waste management systems would be implemented to mitigate any potential damage from the increased footfall expected with each passing year until the island reaches full operational capacity within five years post-launch as per government plans detailed in an environmental impact report published last month detailing sustainability measures designed by Mauritian scientists and marine conservation experts.

Maurice O’Flaherty, a renowned local hotelier turned businessman involved with the project who recently met President Bush to discuss potential investment opportunities between his two respective countries shared candidly about how it has been an exciting journey thus far: "While I can't speak for everyone in this nation or outside of Africa as we know—the world is ours! A luxury island retreat built by Mauritian talent and entrepreneurship to showcase all that makes us special, something people are eagerly anticipating."

The country’s Minister of Environmental Affairs echoed these sentiments last week when he said: "As we continue on this journey towards realizing our ambition for an exclusive island retreat—we must be conscious not only to cherish and protect what makes Mauritius
