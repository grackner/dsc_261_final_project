A snowstorm blankets New York City as travel chaos ensues across Midtown Manhattan on Friday night following an unexpected winter storm that hit the city early Saturday morning and has not relented since then. As of now, at least five people have been reported injured after a pile-up incurred when two buses collided during one of New York City's most heavily trafficked commutes on Monday evening between 57th Street and Times Square station just northbound towards Pennsylvania Station.

The National Weather Service had issued warnings as snow began to fall around sunset hours, with forecasters predicting up to two feet in some areas of the city by nightfall Saturday morning; however, commuters were caught unawares when freezing rain and sleet quickly turned into a dangerous situation. Amidst frigid temperatures hovered at 20 degrees Fahrenheit throughout much of Lower Manhattan as hundreds of thousands attempted to navigate roadways still slick from the storm's aftermath while battling delays caused by heavy traffic congestion, resulting in widespinning vehicles and public transportation backups.

In a desperate bid for assistance amidst mounting concerns about an emergency response that appeared stalled outdoors due to icy conditions at the intersection of Seventh Avenue/61st Street near Grand Central Terminal—a hub known as one of New York City's busiest transit points during rush hour. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) had already begun cutting back services before this latest episode began when commuters onboard a city-operated shuttle became stranded between 20th and 179th Street in the Bronx around midnight Friday after their bus driver fell asleep, an MTA official reportedly confirmed.

"I am very concerned about this situation," said Mayor Bill de Blasio during a morning press conference at City Hall addressing complaints voiced by New Yorkers from all walks of life who shared stories regarding the difficulty in travel and safety due to treacherous conditions on streets, subways trains, bridges throughout Manhattan. He later promised additional snowplow crews would be dispatched immediately if needed as well heeding urgent pleas made earlier by city officials last week warning commuters about a potentially life-threatening blizzard expected to strike Friday night into Saturday morning; an estimated 12 inches of accumulation predicted for the five boroughs based on models from AccuWeather and National Weather Service.

"It's important that people stay safe while navigating this storm," said Deputy Mayor for Operations Ed Koch during a separate interview with WCBS radio earlier today, urging commuters to avoid unnecessary travel unless absolutely essential as snowstorm warnings continued through Friday night until the early hours of Saturday morning when New York City was finally awarded some respite. The last time such an extended spell in heavy snows struck this city back before 1960 - a record set during one particularly bitter winter which saw more than two feet fall on average daily, paralyzing entire sections under inches upon inches of snowfall that blanketed every street and sidewalk within view from Times Square to the water's edge.

Deputy Mayor Koch also reminded city residents yesterday about precautionary measures in place regarding heating bills as temperatures plummet during a time when emergency shelters are opened up throughout borough neighborhoods most affected by severe winter weather;
