Amidst a backdrop of bustling city life and culinary heritage in Lyon, France, renowned for its exquisite food scene dating back to the Roman era, an unexpected discovery has stirred both local and international curiosity this weekend (June 15, 2023). In what can only be described as a remarkable find hidden within the ancient catacombs beneath the city, explorers unearthed several centuries-old recipe books containing unique dishes believed to have been lost during tumultuous times.


Archaeologists and culinary historians were dispatched on Sunday afternoon after an amateur spelunker reported a hollow echo resonating through narrow corridors of the subterranean network in Vieux Lyon, traditionally known as Old City or Villevieille—a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The discovery promises to expand our understanding and appreciation for medieval French cuisine that has been passed down generations but was thought lost due to a period-long exile from the city during past conflicts.


Dr. Jean Moreau, one of Europe's leading experts in gastronomic anthropology who specializes specifically in historical food practices and is currently examining samples brought up by excavation teams led by Chef Étienne Bernardin de La Varenne (1638-1708), the 17th-century pioneer of haute cuisine, shared his awe: "These texts are an unprecedent trove that could redefine French culinary heritage as we know it. The recipes encompass complex flavors and techniques lost to time."


Safely contained within hermetically-sealed environmental chambers, the fragile books will undergo careful restoration before being made available for public study in select academic libraries starting early next year (2024). Experts believe these culinary secrets were preserved by Lyon’s Catholic community to maintain continuity of culture through generations.


Lyon Mayor Georges Abersaloni, who has shown great interest since the discovery was reported last weekend at his annual city tourney event for food enthusiasts and history buffs alike, expressed: "These findings are not only a window into our culinary past but also hold immense value in enriching Lyon's global gastronomic reputation. We aim to commemorate this discovery by hosting an 'Edible History Festival', highlighted with tastings of these traditional dishes, next autumn."


As news of the find percolates across French food circles and academia eagerly anticipates its impact on modern cuisine studies globally.
