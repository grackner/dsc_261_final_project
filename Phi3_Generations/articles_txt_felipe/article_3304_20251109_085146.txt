During a historic visit to Lebanon this weekend, President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden met with thousands of people in Beirut who have been displaced by the ongoing war between Israel and Hezbollah-aligned forces since April last year. The first family held small gatherings at different shelters throughout the capital city where they offered meals, listened to stories from those affected, and discussed a plan of action for aid delivery in partnership with international organizations like UNHCR.

The visit comes as Lebanon's humanitarian crisis continues to worsen amid economic collapse brought on by years of political turmoil – the United Nations now estimates 80% of households are food-insecure, and nearly half have no income whatsoever since hostilities began between Israelis forces and proxies backed primarily by Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. Lebanon hosts a quarter million Syrian refugees who were already struggling with crises before the conflict broke out when Hamas-led militants, alongside Hezbollah fighters took control of southern parts in July 2020 and now find themselves trapped amidst fierce fighting between Israelis forces and proxies backed primarily by Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.

"President Biden was visibly moved as he spoke with families who have lost everything," said a reporter present at one of the gatherings in Beirut, which also included U2 singer-songwriter Bono among their number along with senior officials from around the world including President Emmanuel Macron and former US Secretary of State John Kerry.

"We need to do more as international partners," said UNHCR representative Hana Tahbouni after meeting a family whose home was destroyed by an Israeli attack on July 25, which killed at least 13 people including civilians and two foreign nationals from France while injuring over 40 others. "It's crucial that we work together to ensure adequate humanitarian support for those affected."

The Lebanese government is struggling with the economic impact of COVID-19, which has led it into defaulting on its debt as inflation surges and banks face liquidity problems. The country's economy was already in dire straits before the war began; analysts say that more than half of all Lebanese lived below the poverty line even then with an annual income per capita around $1,800 USD back when Hezbollah seized control after a political crisis. 

In addition to food and shelter assistance for those most vulnerable amid this conflagration that has claimed at least three lives including one American service member who was killed on August 9 in an accident while serving as part of the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces-led coalition against ISIS militants, experts suggest targeting infrastructure repairs such as electricity and water to restore services that are critical for public health concerns amid pandemic resurgence fears among many Lebanese citizens still feeling uncertain about their future due to political instability.

The United Nations says it stands ready to support efforts led by the Middle East's largest country in addressing immediate humanitar01@a\n-rity needs of those most vulnerable as well as work towards longer term solutions for peace and stability across Lebanon, Jordan and Israel amid this complex situation.
