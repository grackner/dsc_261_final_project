A volcano on an Indonesian island has erupted for the first time in over a century, sending ash and lava flowing towards residential areas this morning according to reports from Sumbawa Island. The Mt. Tambora's explosion at around dawn yesterday was caught by local residents who immediately evacuated their homes when they heard loud rumblings beneath Mount Tambora’thy largest peak on the island, which is about 150 kilometers east of Bima City and close to Sumbawa airport in Mataram. This early warning allowed for a rapid emergency response that saw authorities conducting mandatory evacuations within a six-kilometer radius around Mount Tambora well before ash began falling on the village communities located downwind, reports CNN Indonesia citing local disaster management officials and witnesses as of 12:00 PM. Aside from immediate safety measures taken by residents themselves upon seeing volcanic activity in real time with their own eyes for only a handful times beforehand even though it's one of the most active, people here have learned to respect nature while enjoying its beauty but also understand that disaster can strike without warning as per The Jakarta Post. This awareness comes from years spent living under volcanic threat after Mount Tambora first started showing signs of unrest in 2018; small earthquakes and steam vents are now routine sights here, reports the Associated Press citing a local seismologist at Sumbawa's state disaster management agency as stating "this is what we always expected Mount Tambora to do when it decided to wake up from its slumber." Experts say this event could be potentially destructive and dangerous not only for people but also the environment with lava flows, ash clouds that may reach over 10 kilometers high spreading across an area of around ten square miles according to CNN Indonesia's local volcanologist as per reports. It is still unclear how long this eruption will last or if it could lead into a more catastrophic event but the country has always been well-prepared for emergencies involving natural disaster with comprehensive evacuation plans already in place, officials say "We have experience dealing with these situations and our resilience is key. It's all about keeping people safe now," an official from Bima City Disaster Management Office tells CNN Indonesia while urging residents not to panic but also take the situation seriously as a local environmentalist quoted by The Jakarta Post points out that "nature has its own terms, and we need to be ready for it."
