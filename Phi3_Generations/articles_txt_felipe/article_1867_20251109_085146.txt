Breaking news: Startup disrupts tech industry with groundbrein technology in Silicon Valley on March 15th by local entrepreneur Jane Doe's company InnovateTech Inc., which boasts a revolutionary artificial intelligence capable of real-time translation. The startup held an unveiling event at the heart of San Francisco Bay Area, garnering widespread acclaim from industry leaders and technology enthusiasts alike for its potential to bridge communication barriers across different languages seamlessly with just one click on a smartphone app that supports over 150 languages.

Jane Doe expressed her passion for the project during an interview, saying "Our mission was always about more than just technology; it's about connecting people from diverse cultures and backgrounds." The innovative system uses advanced neural networks to interpret spoken words with astonishing accuracy before translating them into text in real-time. Users will simply speak or listen via headphones, depending on the app version they download, input their languages of interest, choose a dialect if necessary, and begin interacting instantly – no language barriers stand between human beings anymore at InnovateTech Inc.'s Tech Fair event in Silicon Valley this March.

Rivals say it's unprecedented as other translation apps only offer text-based interpretation with a lag of several seconds, or require the user to download multiple versions for different languages and dialect options - if they exist at all. "It takes just one click on our app; you speak naturally – no need for language background," said lead developer John Smith from InnovateTech Inc., who has been working closely with world-leading linguists over several months of rigorous development to ensure accuracy across multiple languages and dialects including regional idioms.

Doe is currently finalizing plans on expanding their services, aiming at covering as many global tongues by the end of this year - a goal that would disrupt how people around the world communicate with each other daily if realized successfully enough to make real impact in overcoming language barriers across industries like business negotiations and tourism. Meanwhile, experts from universities including Harvard University's Computer Science department are already studying InnovateTech Inc.'s system as a potential case study for linguistic software development with promising results so far; though the tech sector anticipates fierce competition in this field if new entrants come up before 2024, which is when Doe's team plans to enter production phase and release it publicly.

The startup has already attracted investments from top venture capital firms like Sequoia Capital who see potential for growth beyond translation services into other AI-based language learning tools; while local schools in San Francisco Bay Area are showing interest too after hearing about the technology during a demonstration by InnovateTech Inc. CEO Jane Doe at Tech Fair last month, she added "We're still very much focused on refining our system and making it available to more users worldwide before expanding into different AI services - but I can promise that this is just the start of something big."
