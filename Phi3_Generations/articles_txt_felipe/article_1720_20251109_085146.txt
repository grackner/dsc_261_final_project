NEW DELHI - Amid growing concerns over the impacts of climate change in India and across South Asia, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a new initiative today aimed at accelerating efforts to combat global warming. Speaking from New Delhi on Thursday evening during his monthly radio address, PM Modi said that starting next year, India would be working towards reaching net-zero emissions by 2047 - the country's Independence Day celebration – marking a significant milestone in its climate change agenda.

"Our commitment to reduce carbon footprint is unwagetable and we will not falter," Modi told millions of Indians listening across India’s national broadcaster All India Radio, adding that the nation would also double down on investments towards renewable energy sources like solar power projects in 2047.

India has already been taking several steps to combat climate change and reduce its carbon footprint with a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by half over the next decade, as it continues building capacity for sustainable growth at home while playing an active role on international platforms like COP26 in Glasgow.

"India is committed to doing our part,” said Dr Anoop Kumar Sharma, a leading climate scientist based out of New Delhi who was closely monitoring PM Modi’s radio address and the government's plans for combatting global warming. “This initiative by India will go a long way in setting an example among developing nations.”

The prime minister did not provide specific details on how the country would achieve this, but he encouraged citizens to work towards energy efficiency at homes through smart grids and conservation efforts like limiting use of air conditioners during peak hours. He also called for international support from developed countries as it was vital that they match India's ambition in combating climate change given their significant emissions levels historically, which were responsible for driving global warming to unprecedented rates over the past few decades.

"We need all hands on deck," Modi said during his broadcast address before concluding with a reminder that "together as one world we can fight climate change."
