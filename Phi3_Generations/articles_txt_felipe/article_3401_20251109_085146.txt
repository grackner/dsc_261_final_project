A powerful typhoon made landfall in mainland China's southeastern province of Fujian on Thursday night, causing widespread damage and prompting evacuation orders across multiple coastal cities as it continues to threaten other regions with severe weather. The storm system formed over the South China Sea yesterday afternoon and has since been classified by meteorologists as a Category 2 typhoon before making landfall in Fujian province around midnight local time, bringing sustained winds of up to hurricane-force speeds along its destructive path.

In Wenzhou City alone, officials confirmed over the weekend that more than ten thousand households have been affected by flooding and debris left behind after high winds snapped countless trees across densely populated areas within Fujian's coastal city limits yesterday afternoon into last night. Emergency responders worked around-the-clock to clear routes for evacuees stranded in lowland neighborhoods where heavy rainfall led rivers and small waterways to overflow their banks, as well as ensuring power was restored after it went out across significant portions of the region yesterday evening before storm surges hit shorefront communities this morning.

Fujian's provincial government ordered mandatory evacuations for residents living within five kilometers (3 miles) from low-lying areas in Wenzhou City and other nearby coastal towns throughout southern Fujian by midnight last night local time to move people out of harm’s way before landfalling the typhoon system. Official disaster response agencies have mobilized over 5,000 personnel across southeastern provinces along China's eastern coastline since late July as they work together with military forces tasked specifically for dealing directly or indirectly impacts of natural calamities such as floods and mudslides caused by torrential rainfall from tropical cyclones.

Xu Jie, deputy chief meteorologist at China's National Meteorological Center (NMC), warned earlier this week that the typhoon system was rapidly intensifying but added it did not expect any direct hits on major cities or densely populated areas in coastal regions such as Shanghai and Guangzhou. "It is too early to say whether we will see a ripple effect from landfalling storms like this one, with Fujian being at the center of an emerging low-pressure trough that could develop into what some are calling 'a new typhoon' later this week," Xu told reporters yesterday.

"We expect sustained wind speeds equivalent to a Category 2 hurricane through Thursday night, but our models indicate the system will likely weaken significantly over land and lose tropical characteristics by Saturday as it moves inland toward western Fujian before continuing northward along China's east coast next week," he added. Xu said they expected rainfall to continue for most of this coming weekend across southern provinces like Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan and Hainan which are already experiencing some damage from the ongoing storm season but remain safe compared to other parts of Asia where typhoons regularly hit more often at their full strength.

The latest bulletin released yesterday afternoon by Wenzhou City's meteorological department forecasted sustained wind speeds would drop below hurricane force levels today, with less than five millims (mm) predicted across areas currently experiencing up to 20
