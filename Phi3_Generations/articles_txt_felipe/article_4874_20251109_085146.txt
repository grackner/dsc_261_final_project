In a groundbreinquiring shift in public health policy, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced yesterday that all travelers arriving from non-Schengen countries must now undergo mandatory hotel quarantine upon arrival into the United Kingdom before they are permitted to take Covid-19 tests. The new rules were implemented at UK border entry points starting 4 am today and will remain in effect for a minimum of four weeks, with an initial cap set on accommodations but expected to expand as necessary based on case numbers from abroad.

Within hours following the announcement that all incoming travelers must isolate until they receive their test results at least five days later (and ideally two negative tests before release), airports and hotels across London, Manchester, Birmingham, Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Newcastle upon Tyne, and Glasgow have begun preparations to accommodate the influx of arrivals.

Transport Secretary Grant Shapps revealed last night that 30 government-owned properties nationwide would be repurposed into quarantine facilities with a total capacity for upwards of 54,000 people across all sites combined. In addition to hotels owned by local governments or the National Health Service (NHS), private landlords have been contacted throughout England and Scotland in order to house arrivals unable to secure their own accommodation arrangements.

"As a nation we've always had an obligation of responsibility for our fellow travelers," said Shapps, emphasizing that this move is essential in controlling the spread of Covid-19 within communities here at home while maintaining economic activity as much as possible through necessary international trade and cooperation.

Johnson also warned individuals who disregard public health guidance by failing to self-isolate could face criminal charges, saying it was crucial for everyone's safety that the government took decisive action in response to this latest spike of cases related primarily among travelers returning from South America and Spain. "I ask every one here today not just with my voice but as a matter of law: please do everything possible - don't endanger others by going into crowded places or gatherings," he said at the daily press conference, where experts repeatedly highlighted that despite increasing infection rates abroad, this was still an unprecedented time for life and businesses across our nation.

One of those concerns shared is regarding children's mental health amid these restrictions - a topic brought forth by Dr. Rachel Orr, Chief Psychiatrist at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH), London: "As parents or caregivers who have been unable to hug loved ones during this time already know firsthand how hard it is for kids when they feel socially isolated and alone." As such efforts are made by local councils, social services agencies working with schools across England in order provide supportive activities while their children remain at home.

This decision comes after a recent surge of cases among travelers arriving back to the UK from South America over Christmas holidays led officials here last weekend announcing plans for enhanced testing measures, which included expanding PCR tests and sequencing as well an extended isolation period before release pending negative test results. However due to high demand combined with a lack of sufficient supplies at border control points along the English Channel caused difficulties in meeting these objectives – thus leading officials here today to decide on this change.

The Home Secretary Priti Patel said yesterday, "Our priority remains protecting public health and ensuring compliance against
