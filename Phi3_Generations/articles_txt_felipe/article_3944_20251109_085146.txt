A new economic report on Friday has painted a somber picture of consumer confidence in Atlanta, Georgia amid fears of rising inflation rates and its potential impact on local businesses. The University of Georgia's Center for Business & Economic Research released the findings which showed that only 35% of consumers felt confident about spending money within their city over the next six months—a drop from previous years when confidence hovered around 60%.

According to Dr. Sarah Miller, Director of UGA's Center for Business & Economic Research who authored the report: "We are witnessing a significant decline in spending behavior which is likely affecting Atlanta-area businesses." This downturn comes as inflation rates continue to rise nationwide and have been particularly challenging on lower income households.

The CEO of one local restaurant, The Bistro Diner's Bill Hurd shared his concerns about the economic shift: "With prices continuously going up for ingredients due to supply chain issues coupled with inflation, it’s harder than ever before not only to maintain our current menu but also keep overhead costs manageable."

This report is an early indicator of how rising living expenses and concerns over job security could affect the broader economy. Economists warn that if this trend continues into 2024 or beyond, it might even influence national economic policy decisions as lawmakers grapple with balancing inflation control and employment growth in an effort to restore consumer confidence across all sectors of American businesses.

In response to the report’s findings, Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens announced a city council meeting on January 15th to discuss ways they can provide support for local companies that are struggling with increased costs while also maintaining jobs within their community.
