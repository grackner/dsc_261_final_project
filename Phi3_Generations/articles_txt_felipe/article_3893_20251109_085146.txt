A powerful earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 7.8 struck near Cochabamba, Bolivia on Sunday morning local time, causing significant destruction and casualties as the city struggled to cope amidst heavy rains that exacerbated landslides in the already unstable region. The temblor rattled buildings across a wide radius of over 150 kilometers from its epicenter near Chapare Province, with several aftershocks reported since yesterday's initial quake which registered at magnitude 6.3. Rescue teams were immediately mobilized as the Bolivian government declared a state of emergency in Cochabamba and surrounding departments, urging international assistance while local support poured in through social media campaigns using hashtags such as #CochabambaStrong and #BoliviaHelpUs.


"The city is reeling," said Mayor Mariana Barrientos during an emotional press conference yesterday afternoon amidst the chaos, her words echoing from a hall adorned with images of crumbled structures under spotlights as she addressed national and international media present for live coverage broadcast simultaneously across major news outlets. "We have been through devastating natural disasters before but nothing compares to this catastrophe that has befallen us."


In the aftermath, eyewitness accounts described scenes of despair as landslides triggered by both rain and tremors buried parts of Cochabamba under debris. "We're all trying our best," explained Luis Rodriguez, a local contractor who has been working tirelessly to clear blocked roads since yesterday’s quake struck at 6:24 AM Bolivian Time (17:24 UTC).


Authorities fear that the full extent of damage and casualties may not be known for days as search efforts continue in conditions hampered by continuing rain. An estimated 50,000 to over 80,000 people have been displaced since Sunday's quake according to UNHCR statistics while local reports suggested thousands were homeless and shelterless amidst fearsome aftershock sequences that added to the perilous situation on Monday.


International aid has begun arriving with pledges for immediate financial support, emergency medical assistance, search & rescue teams from Colombia, Chile, Peru, Paraguay, Argentina as well as local volunteers organizing relief efforts using social media platforms in real-time updates of those affected and safe areas. Bolivian President Evo Morales assured that the government is on top of it all, expressing his deepest sympathies to victims' families while stressing coordination with global partners amidst this disaster situation which he described as "the worst one [he has] experienced in over four decades."


As rescue operations continue and a tent city for displaced individuals is erected, the Bolivian Red Cross began distributing emergency kits to quake victims today. International organizations like Médecins Sans Frontières are mobilizing their teams on-site with medical supplies while UNICEF provided immediate psychological support services amidst emotional distress as a result of this tragedy which continues to rock Bolivia in various ways beyond the initial physical destruction brought by the quake and subsequent aftershocks.
