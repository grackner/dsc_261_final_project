In a bold new attempt to revitalize street art in Brooklyn's historic DUMBO district on Friday evening, local government officials unveiled their latest initiative: the first ever curated "muralathon" featuring original works by renowned international artists such as Banksy and Shepard Fairey. The event aimed to attract tourists and locals alike while promoting artistic expression in urban settings, drawing on a combination of public input and expert opinions for selections that span both abstract concepts and social commentary reflecting Brooklyn's diverse community vibe.

The "muralathon" kicked off at 7:0 end with Mayor Bill de Blasio addressing the gathering in front of DUMBO Bridge, where murals began to take shape overnight on previously blank concrete and brick walls throughout the neighborhood. De Blasio praised this initiative as a step towards transforming New York's streets into vibrant galleries that engage citizens with thought-provoking art while creating economic opportunities for local businesses adjacent to these public works of expression:

"Tonight, we celebrate the beauty and power of creativity in all its forms. Let our city be a canvas where every wall speaks boldly about who we are as New Yorkers," said de Blasio during his speech at DUMBO's Brooklyn Bridge Park on Friday night before unveiling some pieces that had been painted by artists already present and waiting for the event to start.

Brooklyn Councilman Antonio Reynoso echoed these sentiments, calling it "a perfect union of community engagement with artistic expression." He also noted how this initiative provides a platform for dialogue on issues relevant today: 

"By creating public spaces that encourage people from all walks to come together and share their voices through art, we can help bridge divides in our city," Reynoso said. "The murals created tonight will serve as reminders of the shared values at the heart of DUMBO." 

During the course of three days following Friday night's kickoff event—with artists and local residents working together to bring about their creations —the public reaction has been overwhelmingly positive. Not only have many taken advantage of free guided tours offered by experienced curators, but several pieces seemingly inspired intense conversations among onlookers as they ponder various themes depicted in the works ranging from street life and gentrification to climate change concerns:

One woman shared her reaction upon viewing a massive mural that seemed like an abstract representation of New York City’s skyline, stating "It's incredible! I never thought art could capture such powerful emotions. It feels as if you are looking at my city from above." 

Other testimonials about the experience include: “This has been a transformative night for our neighborhood – we finally have a space that showcases us and all of humanity's experiences," exclaimed one DUMBO resident while his son-in-law added, "There’s no doubt in my mind now; I feel like this mural is speaking directly to me."

Experts on urban art emphasized the importance of initiatives such as these by bringing attention back into neighborhood streets that have long been perceived merely functional spaces rather than potential canvases for creative expression: 

Artistic Director Sarah O'Reilly commented, "This muralathon exemplifies how cities and communities work
