Business analysts at JP Morgan predict a significant rise in consumer demand as economic recovery gains traction following pandemic lockdown measures across Europe and North America since March of last year (12/05/2020). Experts anticipate that with more relaxed restrictions, e-commerce retailers could see an annual increase of 4.3% over the next two years.

"Consumer behavior is shifting as people become accustomed to shopping online," says Alex Thompson, lead analyst at JP Morgan's Market Insights division in London (02/15/2020). "This trend will likely persist long after the pandemic ends." 

As brick-and-mortar stores reopen their doors and social distancing measures become less prevalent, shoppers have been encouraged to return for a more tactile retail experience. However, many consumers continue shopping online due in part to ongoing concerns about the virus as well as habits formed during lockdowns that may be hard to break (01/25/2020).

"While we are seeing some foot traffic increase at physical stores across major cities like New York, Paris and Berlin, it's not quite back to 'normal,'" says Dr. Maria Gomez, a consumer behavior specialist from the University of Madrid (11/15/2020). "People have adapted quickly; in fact, they now expect more convenience."

Despite some stores struggling with inventory shortages and supply chain delays that began around April 2020 due to pandemic-related disruptions, retailers are making adjustments by expanding online services (10/30/2020). "We've had an influx of new customers seeking both ease of access and the safety measures we have in place," says Sarah Jenkins, CEO of QuickShop E-commerce.

While some retail experts argue that a significant portion of online spending can be attributed to pandemic fears rather than genuine demand (09/10/2020), others believe the change is here to stay for good. "It's not just about survival anymore; it’s an evolution in consumer preferences and behaviors," explains Mark Levinson, a professor of economics at Stanford University who has studied market changes over recent years (08/15/2020).

Next Steps: Retailers must strategize to cater effectively to both traditional and online markets. "Businesses need to adapt quickly or risk being left behind as consumer trends change," says Thompson of JP Morgan, while Gomez emphasizes the necessity for continued research on these changes in behavior post-pandemic (05/20/2021).

Reactions: 
Consumers and retail executives agree that shopping experiences are being redefined by new normals. Many business owners understand they have a pivotal role to play as society navigates these changes together. "It’s about balancing safety, convenience, and personalization for the consumer," says Jenkins of QuickShop E-commerce when considering next steps (04/30/2021).
