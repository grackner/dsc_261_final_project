A group of ambitious entrepreneurs has raised nearly $10 million in seed funding to launch an innovative media startup aimed at revitalizing local news coverage across the Midwest by harnessing AI technology and community engagement strategies, reports CNN Business. The venture named "CommuniNews" officially announced its launch this Thursday with plans to roll out within three months in cities like Chicago, Milwaukee, and Minneapolis-St. Paul aiming for a nationwide expansion by the end of next year.

Founded last summer amid growing concerns about mainstream news sources' dwindling focus on local communities, CommuniNews seeks to bridge this gap through their unique blend of modern media platforms with traditional storytelling techniques - promising fresher content and greater interaction for readers in an era when many feel disconnected from the news.

In a statement released at today’s press conference held downtthy Chicago, CEO Jonathan Moore expressed his vision saying,"We believe that local journalism is not just about reporting what's happening around us; it's our shared history and culture encapsulated in each story". The firm plans to use machine learning algorithms for gathering data from social media platforms with community input while ensuring ethical guidelines are maintained, including privacy concerns.

"If people feel like they’re seeing what others don’t want them to see then it would not work," warned Dr. Lisa Randall, a renowned journalism expert and University of Illinois professor attending the event as an invited speaker. "We need credible information that's fair representation."

This ambitious endeavor follows on heels from another recent startup - NewsSage in New York City with similar goals to CommuniNews but focusing more heavily on political news within local communities and drawing criticism for potential bias over their use of AI tools. Moore was quick, however, to assure that while some technicalities are borrowed here they’ve done extensive research before implementing them into their model; ensuring a balanced perspective with human oversight in every step:

"We have been clear about our principles and it is crucial not only for the credibility but also survival of local journalism. We don't want to see sensationalism or partiality take precedence over authentic reporting," Moore assured during his remarks at today’s press conference in Chicago, adding that CommuniNews intends on employing professionals who share these ideals when hiring staff members for their growing team of reporters and editors.

At this point commendations from the local journalism community are pouring In as they see a breath of fresh air after many years where dwindling resources have forced them to cut back on in-depth, investigative work that forms part of comprehensive news coverage – something seen by some communities struggling not only with their changing demographics but also economic pressures.

Experts agree that fostering community engagement through initiatives like CommuniNews could lead the way towards more vibrant and relevant local reporting, even as they acknowledge there are significant challenges ahead for such business models including maintaining sustainable operations amidst a constantly evolving media landscape filled with disinformation.

"Community-driven journalism is no walk in the park but when we empower our readers to take an active role it’s not just about consuming news anymore, which makes this endeavor even more promising," said Dr. Randall during her session at
