Maria Garcia, a standout midfielder from Spain’s national youth team has been named Player of the Year at an end-of-season U20 Women's soccer tournament in Barcelona. The accolade follows her stellar performance throughout the weekend matches and solidifies her place among top European talents, reports CNN BETWEEN SPORT & POLITICS
Spain’s junior national team hosted this year's Euro U20 Women competition at La Llosa Stadium in Barcelona. Teams from Germany, France, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland also competed for the coveted title over two days of high-intensity games that tested both skill and athleticism on fields across Europe
At 17 years old Maria Garcia emerged as a rising star during these fiercely competitive matches. She quickly caught the eye with her exceptional dribbling skills, strong shot placement accuracy, and strategic positioning throughout each game, CNN BETWEEN SPORT & POLITICS reports
Her team's victory on Sunday brought them to a record seventh title win in eight attempts but also elevated Garcia’s individual performance as she racked up 10 goals with seven assists while tallying just five shots across six games, setting new personal best records for both categories.
"Maria's talent is undeniable; her vision on the field and ability to control the midfield are simply unparalleled," says coach Isabel Fernandez-Sanchez who has been training Garcia since she was a young girl alongside other potential world stars like Ana Perez, Sara Rodriguez.
"She's not just impressive with her skills but also brings heart and determination to every match we play." 
Fernandez Sanchez says the coach feels confident that Maria will be an asset in Spain’s future international competitions once she reaches adulthood, having already been selected for youth training camps where top players from across Europe converge during off-season breaks.
Maria Garcia's success story began when her family moved to Barcelona at the age of 8 so that she could access better soccer facilities and coaching opportunities in Spain; it wasn’t long before coaches spotted potential, inviting Maria for trial camps which eventually led to a scholarship with FC Espanyol.
Garcia credits her father who often brought ballet classes home as part of their after-school routine together - believing that the dance helped improve balance and coordination on the field over time 
“I think my parents always had faith in me, even when I struggled with shyness or self-doubt. My goal is to continue improving every day,” says Garcia who hopes someday she can play for her country at a senior level alongside some of Europe's finest talents like Barcelona forward Laura Gutierrez
