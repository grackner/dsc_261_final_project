In an unprecedented military exercise across the skies of mainland China and Taiwan on Tuesday, thousands of aircraft from both nations engaged in a series of coordinated maneuvers designed to showcase their aerial capabilities amidst rising regional tensions. The live display began early this morning with fighter jets zipping back and forth over cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Taipei, and Kaohsiung while helicopters hovered above the waters of Taiwan Strait.

The spectacle lasted for hours before military officials confirmed its conclusion late in the day after hundreds more aircraft joined from both sides. This was not an ordinary training session; it's a move as much political as aerial, according to experts at Taipei University’s Institute of Defense Studies who were asked whether such exercises might increase tensions across the strait – but they emphasized that this show of strength comes amidst continuous verbal and cyber sparring between both governments.

"We are always prepared for a range of contingencies, including those outside our immediate awareness," said Dr. Cheng-Tze Ho, Dean of the Institute of Defense Studies at Taipei University while commenting on China's military drills in their official media outlet, CCTV News Tonight – an allusion to Beijing’s statements about its readiness should it ever decide to take a more assertive approach towards self-proclaimed sovereign Taiwan. 

Beijing has repeatedly warned Taipei and Washington not to interfere in the region, even as relations between both sides sour since Tsai Ing-wen assumed power from Ma Ying-jeou four years ago – when she promised a different direction for cross-strait ties. 
“We have always maintained that our relationship with China is complicated and unique,” said Foreign Minister Joseph Wu in an official statement, as quoted by the Taipei Times. “Our policy towards mainland China must remain prudent.”

In response to this latest show of military might on Tuesday morning between Taiwan and its giant neighbor across the strait – which observers saw akin to 'militarization' after decades-long dormancy — Beijing issued two sets of statements as it began live broadcasts via state TV, including warnings about possible escalations in response.

“Taiwan must understand that we are always ready for military action if necessary," said Xu Anqiang, spokesman at the ministry’s East Asia department yesterday before announcing an aircraft carrier exercise set to commence tomorrow – a reminder of China's overwhelming naval and air power capabilities. 

The Taiwanese side reacted by emphasizing that they are ready for any scenario while also reiterating their commitment towards peaceful coexistence with the mainland - even as experts noted it is unclear how far Taipei can go if China decides to take a more aggressive posture.

"If war were imminent, we would need stronger international support and alliances," said military expert at National Taiwan University Dr. Huan-Chih Chen while stressing the importance of bolstering domestic defense capabilities in addition to fostering relationships with like-minded democracies such as Japan and Australia – currently seen among staunch supporters on this side of strait, along with diplomatic efforts towards better relations between Taiwanese government officials.
