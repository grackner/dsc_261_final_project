In a recent health scare that has captured public attention and raised concerns around personal relationships in today's society, two college students from University of California Berkeley were discovered unresponsive due to overdose on the school grounds last Friday evening. As local law enforcement investigates how they came into contact with an illegal narcotic, experts are urging a deeper look at drug abuse and peer pressure in educational settings.


Dr. Sarah Jenkins, chief of psychology at Berkeley's School Health Services tells CNN that she is working closely with the family to provide support during this challenging time: "These incidents can be heart-wrenching for all involved. It undersctermts a broader societal issue about peer influence and drug use in college settings." 


The campus community has responded expressively, calling on universities nationwide to strengthen their preventative measures against substance abuse among students. With the increase of such cases over recent years according to The Daily Mail's analysis of national statistics from Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), this incident has ignited a vital conversation on campus safety, student well-being, peer pressure dynamics, mental health resources availability.


Local authorities have closed in on the two students but no arrests had been made at press time as they continue to investigate if foul play was involved or whether these incidents are isolated cases of misguided actions under the influence.
