A recent study by sleep experts at Johns Hopkins Medicine has found a strong link between chronic insomnia and Alzheimer'term health risks. Published on April 21 in the Journal of Neurological Sciences, researchers say that those suffering from poor quality or disturbed nighttime rest are twice as likely to develop memory problems by their late 70s compared to individuals with regular sleep patterns.

The study analyzed data collected between June 2014 and September 2021 involving more than 5,300 adults aged over 65 living in the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan area who participated at least once during their lifetimes as part of an ongoing sleep project.

Dr. Jennifer L. Conroy led a team that examined participants' electronic health records and conducted clinical evaluations to measure cognitive functioning while controlling for various factors, including education level, socioeconomic status, smoking history, obesity, diabetes risk scores (i.e., waist circumference), hypertension prevalence, medication use such as antidepressants and psychotropics — all of which can affect sleep quality or quantity over time.

"Our findings confirm that disrupted night-time rest could put people at a higher risk for Alzheimer's disease down the road," says Conroy in an interview with CNN Health, adding to concerns about insomnia as potentially one of several contributors leading up toward cognitive decline. "The good news is there are many ways we can help promote better sleep."

Among those strategies include avoiding caffeine close to bedtime and maintaining a comfortable room temperature between 60-75 degrees Fahrenheit (about 18°C -24 °C). Conroy advises patients not only focus on how many hours they're sleeping but also the quality of those hours. "Sleep architecture matters," says Conroy, referring to patterns like rapid eye movement and deep non-REM or REM phases during our typical 7+ hour nightly slumber that are essential for restorative rest and brain healing after an active day spent at work/school activities — all of which could help reduce the risk factors associated with dementia.

Acknowledging insomnia is common, she says up to one-third or more of adults suffer from it during their lifetime—often leading them back and forth between a primary care provider (PCP), specialists such as neurologist/psychiatrist with sleep centers who run cognitive behavioral therapy sessions aimed at teaching good "sleep hygiene" habits, or even prescribed treatment regimens like the use of melatonin supplements and sedative-hypnotic medications to help them relax as bedtime approaches.

Conroy says patients often ask about genetic risks for Alzheimer's disease due to a family history but adds there is limited research at this time linking poor sleep with increased inherited chances, though she stresses everyone should work proactively on bettering their nightly rest routines before problems arise.

"Genetics play some role in memory issues," agrees Dr. Richard H. Bernstein of Sleep Disorders Center within the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Complex where he specializes, referring to studies suggesting certain heritable variations like apolipoprotein E and Alzheimer's am
