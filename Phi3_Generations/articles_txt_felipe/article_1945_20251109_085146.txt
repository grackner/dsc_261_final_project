Amidst escalating tensions in Gaza and Israel's northern region of Golan Heights on August 15th, a surprise ceasefire announcement was made by the Israeli military command today at approximately 4:00 PM local time (2:00 AM GMT). The agreement suspended hostilities for seven days. In Jerusalem and Ramallah respectively, there are mixed reactions to this unexpected break from conflict which has raged on since early morning hours last Tuesday with no clear resolution in sight as of yet according to eyewitness accounts like those provided by resident Haim Ben-David who watched the military movements closely.

"I never thought we'd see peace so soon, but I hope this ceasefire holds," shared a relieved mother from Gush Katif on Israel’s Gaza border where families have been displaced multiple times due to past skirmishes with Palestinian militants groups such as Hamas.

Palestinian officials expressed caution about the temporary truce, emphasizing that without addressing core issues like borders and freedom of movement, peace remains elusive despite this newfound lull in hostilities which has brought relief to both Israelis seeking safety at home amidst bombardments as wells Palestinians caught between territories they call their own struggling for dignity under occupation.

International observers including U.S., EU and Arab League diplomats have been actively monitoring developments closely since the start of these latest confrontations with concern centred around fear that any progress towards peace could be undermined by renewed violence just as negotiators attempt to broker permanent agreements aimed at resolution for decades-old unresolved questions surrounding Israel and Palestine's future territories.

Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon commented on the ceasefire saying "This is not an end nor a beginning but rather, another pause in our continued efforts to establish security guarantees between us." He added that talks with Hamas are continuing behind closed doors while acknowledging it as difficult and complex discussions which may take months or even years before any tangible progress can be made.

UAE Foreign Minister Anwar Gargash said, "We call for calm on all sides so these delicate negotiations continue toward a lasting resolution that will bring peace between Israelis and Palestinians." He expressed hopefulness but also warned about the fragility of current situation not only because both parties have fought fiercely over control in past years.

Hamas spokesperson Sami Abdel Rahman said "This ceasefire doesn't resolve anything or create a lasting peace." He criticized Israeli actions calling them provocations that should never be repeated while stressing on the need to find ways towards dialogue without preconditions. Hamas has previously rejected any talks with Israel but he also highlighted humanitarian issues faced by civilians as an urgent matter which cannot wait for negotiations progresses according Palestinian official Mohammad Sweiss who leads delegation of UN-Aided Gaza's civil society organizations in the current round.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said "We are hopeful that this ceasefire will lead to genuine peace and stability while also acknowledging security concerns for our citizens which have been ongoing since 1967 occupation but remain constant throughout time." He reaffirmed Israel's determination to defend itself if needed yet
