Topic: Business - After-Hours

After an unexpected business acquisition deal closed just before closing bell last night at New York Stock Exchange's Nasdaq marketplace, a host of Wall Street watchers were scrambling to understand the implications for this year’th industry and broader economy as markets have continued their activity through after-hours trading.

At approximately 4:15 p.m., shares in GlobalCom Technologies leaped overnight by a staggering 70%, following news that it had been purchased out of the blue for an all-cash deal worth $2 billion, reports CNNMoney and Wall Street Journal (WSJ).

“We’re thrilled to make this strategic investment in GlobalCom," said CEO John Smith. “This will open up new markets across Europe." He added that the company plans for expansion into Latin America within the next 6 months, a goal made possible with the cash infusion from this deal.

Some insiders are now suggesting they may have gotten cold feet before closing time after hearing rumors of possible antitrust concerns from regulators.

Investment firm CapitalTrust, which initially made the deal appear more attractive to GlobalCom by offering a higher cash-and-stock package than its competitors, was immediately swarmed with calls and messages as it tried navigating this sudden influx of interest (WSJ). 

Market observers now wait anxiously for official word from authorities in the U.S., Europe, and Latin America on what steps may be taken to clear regulatory hurdles that often accompany massive mergers or acquisitions like GlobalCom's unexpected deal - a move they believe could change telecommunications landscape worldwide if all goes as planned (CNNMoney).

“We will keep monitoring the situation closely and communicate any developments,” said an FCC representative, adding that their team has already started reviewing regulatory implications of this surprising development. Meanwhile at GlobalCom headquarters in New York City's Financial District, executives have also been
