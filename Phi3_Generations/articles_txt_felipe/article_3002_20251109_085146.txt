A powerful cold front sweeping across Texas caused widespin power outages and severe weather conditions on Tuesday evening into Wednesday morning in Houston, according to officials with the city's Office of Emergency Management (OEM). As many as 300,00 residents could have been affected by blackouts that hit various parts of Texas early yesterday.

The OEM reported seeing gusty wind speeds exceeding 45 miles per hour in several neighborhoods throughout the Houston area before midnight Tuesday when one local resident witnessed a large tree falling on her backyard deck, sending glass and branches flying into the darkness just feet from where she stood.

As if that weren't enough, an additional tornado touched down near Spring Lake Parkway shortly after 12:30 AM (CDT), taking with it another home entirely before dissipating over empty fields approximately two miles away by about 3AM; the National Weather Service had issued a flash flood warning for that area earlier today.

"It's been one of those nightmarish days here," said Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner during an evening press conference at City Hall around sunset, acknowledging not only hazardous weather but also potential water contamination risks as a result of compromised sewage systems statewide. "We are working tirelessly to restore power and clean up after these storms have passed."

Houston residents advised against unnecessary travel until late afternoon when officials announced most roads had been cleared, though debris remained scattered across many areas throughout the city following wind-driven destruction of vegetation. Power was reported restored within several hours in some neighborhoods while others may be without electricity for days to come pending repairs and infrastructure assessments undertaken by utility companies like CenterPoint Energy Co., which serves most customers living east or south of downtown Houston, as well as west-end areas including Beaumont.

City crews were still working into Friday morning with an extensive cleanup effort in progress involving hazardous material teams and specialists called on for assistance by other jurisdictions across the state; Mayor Turner said at least 12 counties have asked for help dealing with severe weather impacts, including Brazos County which reported two people dead from related injuries early today.

"While we've been fortunate that no lives were lost here in Houston due to this weekend’s storm system," Turner said during his latest briefing on Saturday morning at City Hall around 8:30AM (CST), adding there is still a long way ahead before full recovery operations conclude. "We know these conditions have been extremely challenging for our residents and businesses alike."

CenterPoint Energy Co.'s spokesperson, Lori McClure, said they had around 120 linemen working throughout the affected areas with an additional crew expected soon but warned full restoration could take "several days to weeks" depending on extent of damage. She encouraged customers who did not lose power yet still experience outages or disruforts such as intermittent tripping, flickering lights and water pressure loss due to weather-related issues elsewhere in the system for those impacted by it - an estimated 140,000 accounts across Houston alone based on preliminary assessments.

"We apologize for any inconvenience this has caused," McClure told reporters earlier today while emphasizing safety concerns over
