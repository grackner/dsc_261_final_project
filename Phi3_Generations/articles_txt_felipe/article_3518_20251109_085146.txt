In a bold move to combat rising energy prices and climate change, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Thursday that the UK would soon mandate electric vehicles for all new car sales by only allowing hybrde or fully electric models from 2035. The historic announcement came during an address at Chequers estate in Buckinghamshire where he was joined by Chancellor Rishi Sunak, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps and Business Minister Kemi Badenoch to discuss the government's plans for decarbonizing transportation as part of its wider climate commitments. 
"In line with our goal to be a world leader in tackling climate change without compromising economic growth," said Johnson. "This ambitious target will ensure that by no later than 2035, we completely phase out the sale of gasoline and diesel-powered cars." This announcement follows other recent UK initiatives including expanding renewable energy investment through a £147 million fund for home insulation projects; introducing tax breaks to encourage green businesses and boost jobs in greener industries, while also providing financial support schemes such as the "Go Ultra Low Cars" programme aimed at assisting citizens with purchasing new electric vehicles.
Responding to critics who fear potential job losses among oil refineries due to decreased demand for traditional fuels, Sunak said: “We understand that this transition cannot happen overnight but we are committed to supporting communities and industries as they adapt." Furthermore, a recent report by the UK's Committee on Climate Change has highlighted urgent need for more aggressive climate policies. According to Shapps: "The reality is if people in our country want electric cars, then it’s essential we have charging infrastructure that can support millions of them."
As a result, experts predict the move could potentially create up to 209,657 jobs and boost local economies by reducing transportation costs for households across Britain. Environmental groups welcomed this news as an important step forward in achuring net-zero emissions goals, but warned that it was not enough alone; more significant change must be implemented both within the UK auto industry itself, along with international cooperation to reduce overall carbon dioxide output worldwide by 2050.
The Prime Minister reaffirmed his belief in working together towards this shared vision when he stated: "It's essential we do not become isolated islands or nations but work hand-in-hand for the benefit of our planet and future generations." He went on to say that while these are ambitious targets, it is absolutely necessary.
Despite some opposition from within his own party members who argue this will disadvantage British automakers in a global market increasingly dominated by electric vehicles, Johnson remains steadfast: "We must lead not just for ourselves but as part of an international community to ensure everyone benefits.” The transition has already begun with the government investing £2.6 billion into making sure that there is enough infrastructure available across Britain's cities and towns so people can confidently switch over without any major disru0ptions – like charging stations at workplaces, shopping centers etc., as well introducing new regulations by 2035 to ensure all vehicles on roads are low-emission or electric.
In addition the Treasury's "Go Ultra Low Car" scheme continues offering grants worth up to £4,500 for every household planning an EV purchase – which can
