A massive fire engulfed a historic building in Baghdad on Tuesday night. The al-Rasht Palace Complex, constructed over two centuries ago and known for its ornate architecture and cultural significance to Iraqis, was severely damaged by the blaze which authorities believe started from an electrical fault within one of the palace' endrooms.


The inferno broke out around 10:30 PM local time in Baghdad, forcing thousands to flee their homes and seek shelter with friends or family as they watched helplessly while rescue crews battled towering flames for hours before gaining control over the blaze at dawn.

"It's a tragedy," said Fire Chief Abdullah al-Hassan, who was among those fighting against the fire along with more than 200 other members of Baghdad's Emergency Response Unit (ERU). "The Palace Complex holds so much history for our country. It hurts to see it damaged like this."

Eyewitnesses reported that thick black smoke billowed out from the building, casting a sinister shadow across one of Iraq’s most beautiful cities on Tuesday evening as emergency crews raced against time trying to put out what quickly became an uncontrollable fire. The ERU's efforts were hampered by structural damage and water shortages that threatened the safety of both victims trapped inside the building, themselves included in rescue teams responding simultaneously to multiple blazes across Baghdad on Wednesday morning.

The palace complex houses several museum exhibits showcasing Iraq's rich cultural heritage as well as a public library and meeting rooms for local government officials; it has long been regarded by many within the country, particularly elders who remember its past splendor before decades of conflict had left Baghdad in ruin. 

The al-Rasht Palace Complex fire is yet another calamity that highlights years of unstable infrastructure resulting from ongoing regional instability and economic challenges across the Middle East, according to experts who spoke with local media today about their fear for other historic sites around Baghdad. "We're seeing this more often as a sign not only of deterioration but also lack of proper maintenance," said Dr. Sami Awad, an Iraq cultural preservationist and professor at the University of Nassiriya who has led efforts to restore several other historically significant sites within his home city over recent years.

"It's devastating when these fires occur; they are so preventable."
