NEW YORK – In a surprising turn of events at yesterday's game between the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox in Fenway Park, star pitcher Derek Jeter threw an extraordinary curveball that left even seasoned hitters bewildered late into Wednesday night. 

Derek Jeter took to the mound for a routine start against his hometown rival but ended up delivering one of the most memorable performances in recent baseball history, striking out three batters and walking two before finishing with just over five innings pitched during yesterday's game at Fenway Park.

Jeter started as scheduled when he took on Boston Red Sox for an interleague matchup between his Yankees team and the New York City rivals in front of a sellout crowd, but it didn’t take long before fans realized something was amiss – Jeter had taken to throwing curveballs with precision they hadn't seen since college.

"I thought I saw him throw that one pitch from left field," said lifelong Yankee fan Maria Gonzales after the game when asked about Derek’s surprising change in tactics during her conversation at home, which she caught on tape and sent to CNN for additional context into Jeter's unexpected skill.

The switch came as a surprise even among baseball insiders who had known that pitcher was struggling with his velocity since the start of this season; he’d been averaging 91-mph top speed until last week, when it dropped down to around 85 mph for two straight games. Jeter's mechanics coach said they tried countless times over several months but couldn’t identify what went wrong with his pitching motion that caused such a significant drop in velocity and accuracy during the second half of Tuesday night game, which ended when Derek was pulled from the mound after just four innings due to fatigue.

"I had heard rumors about him switching up something different lately but never quite expected it," said long-time pitching coach Tony Martinez who worked with Jeter for years before he left last season in disgrace over undisclosed personal issues that caused a breakdown of trust between player and staff. "It's not often you see an 12th man come out to deliver curveball after coming up through the minor leagues, but Derek always had something special about him when it came down to executing his pitches with precision."

Jeter’s performance drew mixed reactions from other players on both sides of the ball. Red Sox infielder Will Conway expressed frustration over Jeter's sudden shift in strategy: "Yo, Derek threw a curveball that day and tried to pull my head right outta my neck," he said while interviewed during his next game at Fenway Park Wednesday afternoon after hearing about it through the grapevine.

But Yankees first baseman Alex Rodriguez seemed impressed: "It's a crazy move but smart too – I think Derek saw where we were all coming from with him struggling and figured out how to turn that into an advantage for himself," he explained in his post-game interview.

As the Yankees took on Boston Red Sox, they held steady at 76–48 before yesterday's win while rival team continues its hot streak since taking first place last Friday – a result of both players and staff working through their struggles with adaptability over past weeks
