A massive hotel renovation project in downtin New York City is set to finish this summer, promising modern amenities for thousands of guests staying at The Empire Towers – a historic landmark and one-of-a-kind establishment that has stood since the early days of American travel. Construction began last fall with plans unveiled in December by renowned hotelier Jane Doe who acquired the iconic building known for its Art Deco style from private owners, vowing to preserve its character while incorporating contemporary touches and state-of-the-art facilities that cater better to modern travel needs.

"It's been a transformative journey," said Jane Doe at last week’s groundbreaking ceremony outside The Empire Towers on Wall Street, the site chosen for this ambitious overhaul designed not only as an upscale accommodation but also serving as a cultural hub reflecting New York City's dynamic spirit. "We want to create something that honors our past while providing comfort and luxury in equal measure."

Costing $50 million, the renovations involve redesigning 192 rooms across four tower floors without altering their original architectural details—a task undertaken by a consortium of leading interior designers led by acclaimed firm StyleCraft. Guests will have access to an enhanced spa and wellness center, reimagined dining experiences within The Empire Lounge at the lobby's heart, alongside improved transportation options for exploring New York City's diverse offerings—from cultural landmarks like Central Park’s famous Shakespeare Garden to iconic Times Square.

"This project is about seamlessly blending timeless elegance with innovative comfort," stated Michael Sullivan, executive vice president of the StyleCraft team in charge of The Empire Towers renovation on Wednesday afternoon before a preview tour for potential investors and partnerships at Citi Halls—the temporary accommodations currently being used by construction crews working tirelessly to meet an August completion date.

The City's Landmarks Preservation Commission has been actively involved throughout the process, ensuring that original materials such as terrazzo floors and ornate chandeliers remain a prominent feature while integrating cutting-edge technology for guests’ convenience—including mobile check-ins via smartphones connected to The Empire Towers' proprietary app.

Guests will find themselves in an entirely redesigned lobby area boasting glass elevators, free WiFi coverage extending throughout the entire building complex including common areas outside guest rooms and suites on all four tower levels housing 106 hotel room accommodations; each unit offering floor-to-ceiling windows for unparalleled city skyline views with upgraded bedding options.

"When we began, preserving history was our top priority," said Jane Doe standing amidst bustling crew members during yesterday's progress update meeting in The Empire Tower’s penthouse office which will serve as a lounge post-reopening; conversations filled with anticipation echoed through the space. "We are creating an experience that guests can take back memories from not just New York, but also feeling like they were part of its vibrant history."

The hotel’s first suite will be unveiled this Saturday morning when The Empire Towers officially welcomes their distinguished inaugural guest—a well-known actor visiting the city for an international film festival
