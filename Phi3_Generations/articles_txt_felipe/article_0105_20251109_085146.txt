A massive fire in a historic London building has led to numerous injuries and extensive damage to some of England's most cherished cultural artifacts. The blaze broke out at the Old Royal Naval College on Tuesday night, December 5th, sending shockwaves through Notting Hill community members who are still coming to terms with the loss two days later.

The fire engulfed a wing of one building and caused smoke damage throughout several others located within the Grade I listed complex at South Kensington. While no lives were lost during the night, authorities say nearly 20 people suffered from minor burns after escaping through collapsed stairwells in panic-filled scenes witnessed by locals passing on adjacent streets late into Wednesday evening.

"The sense of devastation is palpable throughout Notting Hill," a spokesman for London Fire Brigade tells CNN, noting the Old Royal Naval College's central role as an integral part of English heritage and history dating back centuries to its establishment in 1736 by King Charles V.

The National Lottery Heritage Fund reported that upwards of $20 million worth damage was done during Wednesday morning’s assessment led by officials from the fund, which works closely with England'CTC.'

"It is hard not to feel heartbroken when viewing these images of blackened rooms where irreplaceable artifacts are," an inspector from the Heritage Fund said Wednesday afternoon after spending hours documenting damages in photos taken by firefighters on scene following evacuation orders issued shortly before midnight Tuesday.

Fire Chief Inspector Thomas Walton described his crew working "round-the-clock" to tackle flames at both buildings even as crews continue putting out hotspots throughout surrounding streets with temperatures reaching 30 degrees Celsius Wednesday afternoon, just days after record numbers of people visited London for New Year celebrations.

As rescuers worked through the night evacuating residents from upper floors during efforts to keep fire at bay while ensuring their safety — some taking refuge in nearby hotels and others staying with friends until further notice — Mayor Sadiq Khan urged community spirit amid these trying times on behalf of thousands who have been directly affected by this tragedy.

"Our thoughts are currently focused on helping those whose lives were interrupted last night but as always, we remain vigilant and ready to support all," the London mayor said Wednesday evening via Twitter after visiting victims' families firsthand later that day when he arrived in South Kensington alongside fellow politicians from across Westminster Borough Council.

A local resident who was passing by one of the buildings on Tuesday night told DailyMail she saw flames erupt through open windows and heard screams as people tried to escape via collapsed stairwell access points within a few minutes after midnight; "I could hear sobbing, someone crying out - it's awful," said Rachel Grossman.

While many in Notting Hill shared similar sentiments when speaking about the fire’s immediate effects on their community with CNN during Thursday morning interviews conducted across various hotspots near where damage was still visible Wednesday afternoon, some locals told DailyMail they believed human error contributed to its outbreak given no previous signs of immin
