On Wednesday night in Kinshasa, Zaire's capital city now known as the Democratic Republic of Congo, a massive fire engulfed one-third of Goma International Airport terminal building with over two dozen workers and passengers trapped inside before they were safely evacuated by emergency crews.

The blaze started around 9 p.m. local time in the airport's baggage claim area, spreading quickly through a corridor where cargo planes are stored due to its drywall construction and proximity to flammable materials such as jet fuel tanks used for refueling aircraft on-site. The fire drew immediate attention from arriving passengers when emergency alarms began ringing loudly throughout the airport terminal, followed by flashing strobe lights warning of imminent danger in case of smoke or other hazards within 30 minutes after first ignition.

The National Fire Brigade's chief inspector, Lieutenant General Kabwe Ndaye told CNN that he had never witnessed such an extensive fire at this airport before: "This is the most severe incident I have ever seen in my entire career here; our crews did a remarkable job under incredibly dangerous conditions."

Inside Goma Airport, panic ensued amongst baggage handlers and travelers as smoke billowed from ceiling vents near where they were working at the time. Witnesses say that many individuals began frantranically searching for exits amidst chaos while firefighters fought valiantly to evacuate everyone safely despite heavy foot traffic congesting escape routes due mainly because of ongoing terminal repairs scheduled during regular business hours from Monday through Friday mornings.

Goma International Airport Director Mr. Joseph Ntumba shared his relief after witnessing the successful execution of emergency procedures: "I am incredibly proud to see our firefighters' courage and resilience as they saved everyone without any casualties or serious injuries; this incident has brought us closer together."

Due to the recent influx of refugees escaping conflict in neighboring countries, Kinshasa Airport Authority head Mr. Patrice Lubinda says that "we must improve our emergency preparedness and protocols at all airports across Congo" following a comprehensive internal investigation into potential causes for this disastrous event: "Our top priority now is ensuring better safety measures are implemented to prevent any future incidents, including the addition of fire-resistant materials in high traffic areas."

In response to concerns raised by local authorities regarding insufficient funding and outdated equipment hindering effective emergency responses within Congolese airports nationwide: International Development Aid (IDA) representative Mrs. Anne Thompson affirmed her organization's commitment towards improving infrastructure in the region through increased aid packages allocated specifically for security enhancements, including better access to personal protective equipment and training programs which aim at minimizing risks associated with potential hazards within aviation environments across Africa: "We are dedicated to ensuring our efforts bring tangible improvements not only here but throughout all of Sub-Saharan Africa."

As the world reacts, many countries pledge support while others highlight their own experiences dealing with similar emergencies. The United States' Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Director Mark Broughton expressed concern about ongoing refugee crises in African nations: "It is unfortunate that such devastating disasters continue to happen
