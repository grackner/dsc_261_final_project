"Chicago Blackhawks' Sidney Crosby Takes on Mental Health Awareness: 'My Journey is Just Beginning'" - By Alex Thompson  

Wednesday evening, the Chicago Blackhawks hosted their first game of the season against a team from Boston and saw Sidney Crosby in attendance. The seven-time Stanley Cup champion took time out to visit fans with his family before stepping onto the ice. "It's been my dream since I was young," said an emotional Crosby, who has faced personal battles that have touched on mental health issues back home in Canada."

Crosby came forward about seeking help for himself and urged other athletes to do likewise if they are struggling. The 32-year-incongruous veteran of the NHL joined players from across North America who also openly discuss their struggles, including former San Jose Shark defenceman Brent Johnson. "I want people around me and all professional athletes to know that it's not something I feel ashamed about," he said earlier in January at a conference with mental health advocates organized by the NHL Players Association (NHLPA).
 
The former Pittsburgh Penguin, who played alongside Crosby from '05-2014 and won five Stanley Cups together, added: "If you have someone on your team that's struggling with something - it doesn't make them any less of a person." The Blackhawks forward is working through his struggles under the guidance of Dr. Andrew Miller, who specializes in treating athletes for depression and anxiety disorders at Illinois Health Psychiatry Center outside Chicago where Crosby sought help earlier this year after noticing dark thoughts coming into play on several occasions before Christmas 2019 when he checked himself into a treatment facility to seek professional assistance.

"Sidney took the right decision by going for that support," said Dr. Miller, who has been working with Crosby throughout his recovery process from October through early January and plans further sessions ongoing until after this season's final games wrap up next March 20 in Atlanta against the Lightning at American Airlines Center before returning to Canada post-season where he can continue his therapy. "He told me that things started taking a turn for him around Christmas time, but also shared how having Sidney here with us all is really helping," continued Miller after Crosby's meeting as they talked about the importance of seeking support in battling any form of mental health issues."

The conversation comes amid recent reports from inside and outside North America that professional athletes are becoming more comfortable speaking up when dealing with their struggles. And at a time where many still see sports figures only for what happens on court or field, the conversations surrounding athlete well-being could make all the difference - not just to them but also others who look towards these individuals as role models in society," concluded Miller after hearing Crosby speak about his desire want people around him and fellow athletes at conferences such as this one. "If I can do something like that, it'll be a great help for many."

Next Steps: Reaction from NHL Players Association (NHLPA) President Dale Tallmon was positive about Crosby stepping forward and urged his fellow players to follow suit if they are struggling with their mental health. "I am proud of Sidney not only taking this courageous step but also encourag
