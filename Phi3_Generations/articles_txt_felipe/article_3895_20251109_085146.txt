Topic: Entertainment - Television

In a groundbre end for entertainment journalism students at Boston University's College of Communication on Wednesday evening, Professor Emily Roberts announced that her class would take part in an unprecedented live broadcasting event to be held outside the New York Pantheon Theater. The special edition will involve interviewing famous Hollywood actors and actresses directly after their performances at Broadway shows over the past year as a way for students to gain first-hand experience of TV news reporting skills, with this particular segment dedicated solely to entertainment journalism within television media studies.

"I am excited about these talented young minds getting hands-on practical work that will set them apart," said Roberts during her class lecture at the university's auditorium on Wednesday morning before revealing the news of their participation in this unique opportunity to report live outside a theatre for an audience. "With every performance they cover, these students are learning how to connect with celebrities and share stories that not only captivate viewers but also provide insight into Hollywood's latest trends."

The event is scheduled to take place next Saturday evening at 7 pm ET when the actors will be available for interviews. The student reporters, all juniors majoring in Television Journalism and Entertainment Reportage within their respective studies, have been preparing since September by attending backstage events of Broadway shows hosted weekly during performances throughout last year to observe how professionals interact with celebrities while maintaining professional ethics under pressure.

During her speech on Wednesday morning in Boston University's auditorium full of eager journalism students, Roberts emphasized that "the best reporters are those who can quickly establish rapport and make their subjects comfortable." In line with this approach, the BU student group has adopted a light-hearted yet respectful tone when communicating with actors during backstage events.

To ensure comprehensive preparation for covering live interviews outside New York Pantheon Theater on Saturday evening next month, Roberts assigned two guest journalists from CBS News as mentors to provide professional insights and guidance throughout the process. Mentor Richard Wells spoke about his experience interviewing well-known celebrities: "It's all about being genuinely curious while maintaining respect for your subject’s privacy, time, and public persona."

Several BU student journalists expressed their excitement toward the upcoming opportunity in interviews held on campus last week. Sophomore Sarah Lee commented that “I am looking forward to meeting some of New York's finest actors here; I believe this experience will not only help me improve my interview skills but also give a deeper understanding into how entertainment news is covered.”

In the final paragraph, senior television journalism professor Robert Thomas shared his thoughts on what makes this assignment crucial for student reporters: "The ability to report in real-time during live events while connecting with your subjects and capturing stories that hold value beyond just their celebrity status. It's a significant learning milestone they will carry forward into their careers."

As the event approaches, these Boston University journalism students are ready to take on this new challenge of entertainment news reporting outside New York Pantheon Theater next month and learn valuable skills that can propel them ahead in their television career aspirations.
