A devastating fire engulfed a historic train station in Chicago's South Loop neighborhood last night, leaving at least three people dead and over fifty injured as emergency services struggled to control the blaze that broke out around midnight on Saturday (June 10). Fire officials have confirmed that all four rail tracks were destroyed after extensive damage from a major fire started in an electrical room.

"The scene is absolutely devastating," said Chief Fire Marshall Mike Schoenewerk, speaking to reporthis evening while surveying the charred wreckage with other first responders and city officials at City Hall Square just across LaSalle Street from Union Station's site of destruction on 15th street. "Our top priority right now is extinguishing any remaining pockets of fire, but we also have to ensure that the area remains safe for potential victims or witnesses who may be present."

The South Loop Fire Department received its first call at approximately midnight yesterday when dispatchers reported a loud explosion in one of Union Station's electrical rooms - where trains from across Illinois converge before proceeding along their respective routes to Chicago O'Hare International Airport, Milwaukee Interstate Shuttle bus terminal and other transport hubs throughout the Midwest.

Within moments after hearing alarms ring through a massive building that once stood as one of America’s iconic stations for more than 100 years before its closure last month following an annual inspection by federal safety inspectors, Chicago Fire Department firefighters and paramedics raced to the scene alongside their Southern Illinois counterparts.

Union Station itself is not on a rail line but it hosts over two dozen trains per day from 45 stations across North America which stop at this hub before continuing into other states or provinces as well, according to The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) website that offers detailed statistics about train traffic throughout the United States.

As of tonight’s fire report by Union Station Fire Chief Scott Hutton: "The station was a busy intersection with an estimated 20 trains arriving daily - mostly cargo freights carrying hazardous materials such as ethanol, diesel fuel and grain for agricultural use." He also confirmed that there were no casualties before the fire broke out.

"This is absolutely horrible," said Chicago's Mayor Lori Lightfoot after touring Union Station alongside Fire Chief Hutton last night - both of whom had been working together to battle this blaze with crews from cities including Milwaukee, Rockford and St. Louis as well for assistance provided by Illinois Department of Emergency Services (IDES). "We are all devastated at the loss of such an historic landmark which once stood here but will never forget those lives lost - we owe it to them."

In a separate interview with Chicago Sun-Times this morning, Union Station Fire Chief Scott Hutton expressed his condolences: “Our hearts go out to everyone who has been touched by this tragedy and my thoughts are with all of the families affected,” he said after returning from fighting flames that continued today amid concerns about weakened support beams causing cracks in surrounding buildings at 1708 LaSalle.

Union Station Fire Chief Scott Hutton was asked how many firefighters have responded to this scene since Friday night’s explosion and he replied, "As of tonight we are working with over 250 first res
