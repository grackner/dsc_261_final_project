In a sweeping development across Yemen on Saturday, rebel forces succeeded in capturing key government installations near Houthi-controlled areas of Sanaa following intense negotiations facilitated by the United Nations. This shift comes amidst escalating tensions that have been teetering towards direct conflict for months now. The UN's mediators met with both Yemeni authorities and rebel leaders in recent days to discuss a ceasefire agreement, which was finally accepted after hours of heated deliberation overnight.

The seizure has significantly altered the dynamics on the ground where clashes between Houthi fighters loyal to their Shia Muslim identity against Sunni-backed rebels supported by Riyadh have become a daily reality for Yemen' enduring years of civil war since 2014. The UN envoy, Martin Griffiths, who spent hours in discussions with both parties at the heart of this crisis zone - Sanaa International Airport and al-Baydah airbase located close to each other - expressed hope for a reduction in violence after agreeing on an 'interim' deal.

"This is indeed progress," said Griffiths, referring not just to immediate cessation but also agreed terms involving prisoner exchanges between the parties and easing of economic sanctions imposed by Riyadh over alleged arms flows into Houthi territories in 2015 during Yemen's civil war.

Yet experts are caution about how quickly things can change on this volatile front, with Saudi Arabia keen to protect its interests and keep the Houthis from gaining more ground around Sanaa while avoiding a full-blown conventional armed conflict that could draw Riyadh into another devastating regional war.

"The capture of government installations by rebels would not be surprising if we had been seeing significant escalation in the past days," said Dr Omar Yousef, an analyst at Middle East Institute who has studied Yemeni politics closely since 2013 when al-Houthi rebel forces first took control of Sanaa's airport. "The situation now is incredibly fluid with Riyadh and its Gulf partners trying to manage the balance between pressure on the Houthis while not pushing things overboard."

Meanwhile, Yemeni government officials have expressed deep reservations about accepting terms proposed by their adversaries who still control parts of northern provinces vital for economic survival due largely to key infrastructure like ports in Aden and Hudaydah. The UN envoy has urged both sides not only to reduce hostilities but also commit fully towards a peace deal expected later this month after further rounds of talks, which will be held amidst the ongoing Saudi-led military campaign against Houthi rebels that started in 2015.

But for now, all eyes are fixed back home as Yemenis struggle to resume daily life under a de facto division between Shia and Sunni territories within their capital city where both sides have set up parallel administrative authorities overseeing essential public services like schools, hospitals, water supply networks.
