A daring hijacking attempt in Lagos took place yesterday when three men tried to overpower a Nigerian Air Force Boeing AH-64 Apache helicopter with improvised explosive devices (IEDs) at the Eko International Convention Centre, an area known for large gatherings and demonstrations. The unprecedented act was stopped by security forces within minutes of its commencement as they dismantled a makeshift catapult constructed on one side to launch homemade grenades toward the chopper's tail section in a brazen attempt at intimidation and control. This alarming event unfolded just hours before an international summit was set to convene here, drawing attention not only from local authorities but also national security agencies across Nigeria.

Official sources confirmed that three individuals were apprehended while they worked on assembling the catapult early this morning when no one else was around for fear of detection by law enforcement patrols increasing due to heightened tensions leading up to such high-profile meetings. An unidentified source told The Guardian, a Nigerian newspaper reporting from Lagos: "The suspect's aim wasn't just the helicopter itself but also sending out chilling messages through what they wanted everyone else who heard about it later tonight."

A spokesp0ss from Nigeria Centre For Counterterrorism (NCCE) said: "We understand that this is not just an attack on military assets but also a desperate cry for attention amidst the growing socio-political and economic crisis afflicting many parts of our nation."

Authorities have assured they are working round the clock with intelligence agencies to trace these individuals' identities further; however, local residents express concern about safety measures in place during such important political events. Many feel like their daily lives will never be safe again after what happened yesterday morning around Lagos International Airport - Eko City and fear that more attacks could happen anytime since similar incidents have occurred elsewhere on the continent with alarming frequency lately, raising questions over regional security dynamics not just within Nigeria but across Africa.

In response to these events leading up this international summit in Lagos next weekend: Federal Minister for Transport and Infrastructure Rt Hon Senator Gbengi Gormon stated during yesterday's press conference that extra patrol units have been deployed around vital gatherings scheduled throughout the city until further notice. "It is our solemn duty as government to ensure peace, safety, security amongst citizens above everything else," he added while reassuring Nigerians of their commit
