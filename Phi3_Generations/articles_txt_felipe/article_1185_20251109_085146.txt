A culinary tradition was celebrated in Charleston this past weekend when locals gathered for a historic food and wine festival that commemorates South Carolina's rich agricultural legacy. The three-day event took place at the scenic Battery Promenade, drawing thousands of enthusiasts who reveled not just in flavors but also traditions dating back to the early colonial era.

Founded by local historians and chefs dedicated to preserving South Carolina's unique culinary history, this year’ endowed visitors with a deeper understanding of Southern cuisine through various tasting booths offering traditional fare like shrimp and grits, Hoppin' John soup, cornbread strawberry pies, and more.

"I am so proud to see our community come together around food that represents who we are," said Sarah Johnson, one of the festival organizers. "The event helps us remember where we came from while looking forward."

Organizers partnered with local farmers like Charles Parker (56) and Georgia Wilson-Hunter (49), whose family has operated a peanut farm in Camden County for five generations, to provide fresh produce directly sourced from South Carolina's fertile lands. Both men emphasized the significance of supporting regional agriculture while sharing stories about how these staple foods became synonymous with Southern culture through personal and family experience:

"My great-great-grandparents cultivated this land before me," said Parker, "The peanut isn't just a crop; it’s our heritage." Similarly, Wilson-Hunter expressed that “I find cooking these dishes to be like storytelling - every ingredient has its own tale.”

Experts in gastronomy and food history such as Dr. Michelle Evans (53), a professor at the College of Charleston's School of Medicine who specializes in Southern Food Studies, spoke about how festivals provide an essential platform for educating both locals and tourists alike on cultural significance: "Events like this are crucial to keep our history alive," said Evans. “We must remember that food is a way we connect with the past."

The festival's success has inspired similar initiatives across other Southern states, as chefs hope for an enduring tradition of appreciating their shared heritage through culinary delights and communal celebration — one plate at a time.
