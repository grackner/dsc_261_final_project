AUSTIN, Texas – The Dallas Cowboys will have to navigate a challenging offseason as star quarterback Dak Prescott announces retirement from the NFL effective immediately. His decision came amid speculation of his dissatisfaction with team performance and growing weariness on the field since last season's playoffs in January, sources say.

Prescott was drafted first overall by Dallas Cowboys as a rookie out of Mississippi State University in 2nerdland-Birmingham (MSU) back in April 2016 and had spent his entire professional career with the team until yesterday's announcement on ESPN. Since then, he has amassed over 50 touchdown passes while also setting franchise records for completion percentage at an impressive rate of almost two-thirds during each season in which Dallas played a championship berth – and never missed more than four games due to injury or suspension throughout his years with the Cowboys.

During yesterday's media conference call, Prescott said: "I am proud of my time here at the Cowboys as they have done for me what no other team has been able to do - support and believe in a player who doesn’t come from wealth or fame but believes that hard work leads towards greatness."

The news comes days after Dallas, which had hoped he would stay on board past 2019 when his contract expired. Cowboys coach Jason Garrett expressed regret at Prescott's departure and shared: "Dak has been a tremendous player for us – we will find ourselves struggling without him."

The Dallas Daily News reports that sources in the locker room say players have already started to feel the absence of Dak as he had become an integral part not just on game day but also during off-season meetings and training sessions. He led by example, always giving his all – something some younger quarterbacks still aspire for today with no better role model than him among professional teams in Dallas.

Former Cowboys head coach Jimmy Johnson shared: "Dak had a unique talent; he was not just the leader on the field but off it too and will be missed as an ambassador to our great franchise." 

As Dak seeks new challenges, many fans across Texas fear for what lies ahead in his football journey. The Dallas Morning News reports that at least six teams are interested in Prescott’s talents after the Cowboys let him go unprotected on Wednesday night's draft deadline but sources say Atlanta and New Orleans seem to be leading their pursuit with significant offers made so far, which include a two-year contract extension as well as lucrative financial bonuses for Prescott if he performs exceptionally in the next season.

Prescott remained tight-lipped about his future plans except that "it is not here at Cowboys and I have to get my name out there again." As a retiree, it remains uncertain how quickly teams would accept him back or even whether they will see fit due to Dallas' recent missteps with drafting rookies. Nevertheless, the football world can only speculate about what next may come for Prescott and his impact on other franchises as he steps out of retirement into a new chapter in professional American Football – leaving behind memories that won’t ever be forgotten by Dallas Cowboys fans forever.
