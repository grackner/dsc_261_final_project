Sarah Jennings sat by her daughter's hospital bedside as doctors administered a delicate procedure at Atlanta Children’in Hospital yesterday morning that has given the nine-year-old Georgia native new hope for recovery from congenital heart disease, according to sources. The operation was led by Dr. Amina Khalil, one of only a handful of surgeons in the country with expertise treating this rare condition, and marks the first time such a procedure has been attempted at any U.S. facility on an adult patient since 2017 when another nine-year-old was given similar life-saving treatment here before passing away two years later due to complications that are not uncommon with these high-risk surgeries, per the Children's Heart Foundation website and multiple expert interviews.

The groundbreaking operation at Emory Saint Joseph’ s Hospital (ESJH) used advanced 3D imaging techniques as well as a robotic arm to assist in creating an accurate model of Jennings' heart for pre-operation planning, with results that could pave the way toward similar treatments by surgeons across America. The mother shared her gratitude towards ESJH and Dr. Khalil: "We are overwhelmed with hope at this time," said Jennings before adding, “This operation is a new beginning for my daughter – one that I couldn't imagine possible just months ago.”

The highly complex procedure required replacing parts of the heart to correct severe structural abnormalities. Dr. Khalil noted in an interview with CNN last year about this particular case: "Without cutting into the patient’s chest, we used a specialized 3D-imaging system combined with robotic assistance technology that allowed us more precision and control during every step of surgery." She added to reporters yesterday from Atlanta Children'in Hospital as Jennings prepared for her first post-operation checkup: "Our success here is not just about this individual patient, but rather the advancement in treatment possibilities it represents. This could potentially offer a lifeline for many young patients facing similar battles."

The operation took several hours to complete and had risks of complications typically associated with surgeries that involve opening up chests or manipulating major arteries within close proximity, such as bleeding, infection, stroke-like symptoms (transient ischemic attack), arrhythmias amongst other things; however doctors have yet to reveal any serious issues. Jennings' mother and father sat alongside her bedside after the procedure with tears streaming down their faces: "We are so grateful that this incredible team performed such an extraordinary operation on our precious girl," said James, while his wife continued adding about Dr. Khalil saying she was “one of a kind”. 

Emory Saint Joseph’ s Hospital will continue to monitor Jennings' progress closely as her hospital stay is expected to last at least several weeks with multiple checkups and possible procedures depending on how well the new structure integrates within the heart, per medical sources. The Children's Heart Foundation estimates that about one in 250 babies are born each year diagnosed worldwide (in all countries) with congenital heart defect of this severity; however many infants may not survive past their first few months and often times doctors recommend palliative treatment or amputation of the damaged part as no other option. The non-profit organization's website claims that only about
