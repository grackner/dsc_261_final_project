Wall Street Struggles as Tech Stock Crash Leaves Millions Worried About Economic Health and Recession Risks Loom Larger in Investors' Minds This Week - Financial News Today, a leading business news source covering market trends. (New York) – Major tech stocks plummeted yesterday amid fears of an economic slowdown, causing the Dow Jones Industrial Average to drop by 750 points or nearly 3% in one day alone as investors react with concern over possible recessionary forces on businesses and individual livelihoods.

"While we're seeing a lot of negative news right now and concerns about inflation are growing - some argue it may even be entering into what is known as 'hyperinflation,' where prices increase rapidly due to supply chain issues, labor shortages; other factors like energy costs continue driving up expenses across all sectors," remarked Dr. Sarah Jenkins, professor of Economics at Columbia University and frequent guest commentator on CNBC's Squawk Box television program last Friday evening during a segment about market volatility discussing possible causes behind tech stock price drops; she highlighted that investors were increasingly fearful amidst these factors as well, which contributed to today’s sell-off but insisted there was still hope if policymakers acted promptly and effectively by implementing measures such as raising interest rates or introducing fiscal stimulus packages aiming at boosting spending within the economy - despite her admission that it would
