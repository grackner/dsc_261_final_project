Topic: Politics - CNN Polls

As election day approaches on November 3rd across America's diverse political landscape, CNN polls are showing a tight race in swing states with millions ready to make their voices heard at the ballot box. The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll revealed that Americans feel more divided than ever before over major policy issues such as health care and climate change while expressing optimism about economic growth prospects, according to findings released this morning.

In a statement, John Doe, Chief Political Analyst for CNN Politics said: "We are seeing historic levels of dissent among the American public on key policies which could be reflected at the polls next Tuesday." 

The survey conducted by ABC News and The Washington Post involving over 1,200 registered voters found that only a small majority (56%) agree with major government intervention in healthcare. As for climate change concerns, just under half of Americans feel it's mostly caused by human activity while 43% believe natural factors play the larger role according to an analysis done using data from this survey and others taken earlier this year. Despite these stark disagreements on critical issues, there is a shared belief among voters that their voices matter - with over 80% of respondents expressing confidence in government officials elected through democratic processes during the final presidential debate last month hosted by Chris Wallace from Fox News Channel and NBC News.

Early voting has already begun, as seen at locations across states like Florida where more than three million voters cast their ballots ahead of Election Day on November 3rd due to pandemic-related concerns. With millions poised to make history in the polls next week after President Donald Trump won reelection against Hillary Clinton by less than a percentage point four years ago, it remains uncertain whether Joe Biden or Donald Trump will win this year's race amidst one of America’s most divisive political seasons yet.

In response to these findings released today on the state of American politics as we head towards November 3rd elections nationwide in a climate-climate, healthcare and economic uncertainty across states like Florida where early voting started over two weeks ago according to election officials there - Mark Johnson from CNN Politics shared some thoughts: "It's clear that Americans are deeply divided on key issues such as policy directions. Yet despite this division we see people out at the polls ready for democratic action." 

As elections approach, political experts urge voters to remember their right and responsibility in making informed choices regardless of where they stand politically during times when polarized discourse seems more rampant than ever before.
