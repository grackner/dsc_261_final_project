During a weekend cycling tour in Italy on June 5th, an art student stumbled upon what appears to have been one of Leonardo da Vinci's lost masterpieces thought only fragments existed. The unexpected discovery was made near the city walls of Lucca when local resident Giulia Romano noticed something peculiar sticking out from behind a bush in her backyard garden after spending Sunday afternoon there with friends and family. As reported by CNN, art historians were called to analyze several small sketches found nearby which seemingly depict elements similar to those present in the painting da Vinci worked on decades earlier between 1483-1506 during his stay at Ambras Castle near Trento as an artist for Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan.

The art student who found it stated: "When I moved into my backyard garden last summer, there was just so much beautiful greenery that day with the sunlight shining through." The object she initially thought to be a piece of broken pottery turned out to have been painted and framed in an antique style. Local art historian Federico Russo examined it under magnification while expressing his disbelief: "I've spent decades studying da Vinci, but never imagined that one day something like this could happen."

Museum director Elisa Bianchi further explains the plan they're following; researchers have decided not to display it just yet until a more extensive study can be conducted.

Giulia Romano adds that as an amateur artist herself, she was thrilled by this unplanned discovery but also aware of its potential significance: "I felt lucky on the day I found something unique in my backyard garden - now to see it recognized worldwide is just extraordinary." While awaiting a definitive conclusion from art historians and experts who plan meticulous studies, including ultraviolet light inspections and infrared imagery scans next week at La Sistina Museum where the work will stay until then; Giulia Romano remains cautiously optimistic: "I know it's not official yet - I am still just excited to be part of something so special."

Art experts are calling for patience but emphasize that with such a potential discovery, further studies need time. Renowned art historian Professor Luca Moretti remarks at the National Academy Museum in Rome: "We must proceed carefully and objectively while acknowledging what could well
