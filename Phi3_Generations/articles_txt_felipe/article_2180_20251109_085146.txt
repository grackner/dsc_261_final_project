An earthquake measuring a staggering magnitude of 7.8 struck near Cascadia Coast early this morning without warning as per preliminary reports from US Geological Survey (USGS). The quake has caused considerable structural damage across the coastline, with several towns experiencing severe tremors including Tsunami Bay and Seismic Springs in California; Richter Heights and Fault Crest Junction both located just outside Oregon's capital city of Salem. Initial reports suggest around 150 casualties as emergency responders continue their search efforts along with rescue operations across the affected towns, according to data from local authorities obtained by CNN affiliate KVBC in Las Vegas and WAPT-TV out of Jackson MS just after noon Pacific time today. Officials have reported that thousands are displaced due to collapsed buildings while shelters near Bend city hall opened their doors this evening as relief efforts intensify, with the US Army Corps arriving later in force from Fort Campbell across Lake Cumberland and National Guard units being mobilized throughout Alabama after yesterday's earthquake warning system alert. The governor of California has declared a state of emergency while New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham stated that her entire family was safe but also expressed gratitude for the rapid response by national authorities as per officials speaking to CNN on-the-record, though it is still unclear how many people have sustained injuries or are without shelter following this catastropic event reportedly being felt up to 50 miles from its epicenter.

"The scale of this event is truly unprecedented, even by California standards where earthquakes are an expected occurrence rather than a rarity."

Residents express fears about possible tsunamis as they continue evacuating from coastal regions with some saying that while grateful for immediate relief efforts following yesterday's 6.3 magnitude quake near New York City which resulted in no reported deaths but widespread anxiety amongst citizens who have never before witnessed one firsthand; others say now could be a time to come together as communities unite amidst crisis aftermath and recovery period while reflecting upon what was lost during this traumatic experience. One survivor recalls feeling fear at once yet also shared solidarity with fellow evacuees when they gathered last night under tents pitched outside Tsunami Bay's town hall for prayer services organised by local church leaders - the atmosphere emotionally charged as people found solace and comfort from one another during trying times. Mayor John Harris of Bend city has since ordered mandatory evacuations across all coastal zones while pleading with everyone in his jurisdiction to come together immediately following this unfortunate event which he describes "as devastating" but ultimately hopeful that their small community will stand resilient through rebuilding efforts.
