At least seven people were injured during a robbery at a convenience store in downtner Los Angeles on Monday night around midnight, reports coming out of LA County Sheriff's Office indicate. The incident happened near the corner of Sixth and Broadway when two masked individuals forced their way into Mini Mart 4 Ways Superette with pistols drawn.

Sheriff’s deputies were dispatched to the scene as soon as calls for help came in, but shots from what witnesses claimed was a high-caliber weapon pierced through windows and walls before it ceased fire by itself shortly after 12:30 AM PDT Tuesday. One of the suspects is believed to have fled on foot while his partner still stood with their hostages inside, law enforcement sources tell CNN affiliate KABC TV LA County Sheriff's spokesperson Jim McEvoy stated in an interview that "two adult males walked out front and made a run for it," adding he believes the weapon used was of intermediate range.

"The gunfire stopped on its own after about 45 seconds, which is just incredible...it’s like something you would see right here on our screens every day,” McEvoy said as shots resounded in his earphones while reporting from a press conference held at LA County Jail. “We have not seen this kind of thing before."

Witnesses shared their experiences, with one recalling the initial exchange between robbers and store clerk: "At first they came up to me like strangers,” he said in an interview on Monday night's local NBC affiliate KCBS. “I tried not to panic but it was difficult when two people just walked right into my shop wielding guns."

Store employees reported hearing gunshots that rang out during what had been a regular shift until then, with some recall being struck on the head or body by bullet fragments while hiding behind counters. Another employee told WPIX-TV in New York City about her encounter: "I was sitting at my station when suddenly shots were fired through windows," she said Wednesday morning after leaving LA to visit relatives across state lines following police questioning earlier that day. “It's a very surreal experience, I still can hardly believe it happened."

Members of the public who witnessed or heard about similar criminal activities in different parts throughout California have been on edge since last summer when violent crimes rose by 15% across major urban areas like San Francisco and Oakland. These occurrences led authorities to implement stricter measures aiming at preventing further escalation of violence, which included increasing foot patrols, enhancing surveillance systems using facial recognition technology - all while trying not let their guard down during a time when people are already feeling unsafe due to concerns over the spread of COVID-19 and economic uncertainty.

The LA County Sheriff's Office is continuing its investigation with fingerprint dustings being applied at various crime scenes, DNA samples from weapon casings collected by forensic teams examined back in labs using high tech machinery capable to sift through genetic material left behind on the scene. "Our priority has been and always will be serving our community," LA County Sheriff Alex Villanueva said at a press conference yesterday afternoon, addressing reporters gathered outside of its downtown headquarters where deputies are working around-the-clock to ensure public safety while maintaining order during this
