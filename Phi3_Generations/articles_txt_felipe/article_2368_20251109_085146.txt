A severe thunderstner hit baseball games in Seattle yesterday as organizers were forced to cancel all scheduled matches at T-Mobile Park following lightning strikes and heavy wind warnings. With the season's home stand already under strain, players from both sides of Sunday's doubleheader had barely begun their warmup routines when flashes first appeared on the stadium's massive scoreboard - not a forecast update or promotional banner as anticipated by spectators accustomed to cheering between innings and foul balls.

At approximately 12:30 PM PT, lightning strikes struck within four miles of T-Mobile Park without any prior warnings from the National Weather Service (NWS). By then, fans were already enjoying a day off after Friday's rainy game that saw Seattle strike out against Anaheim. The sudden storm had brought down branches on Monday night at Safeco Field but caused no harm to players or officials until now; this time, conditions led organizers into actioning the first ever doubleheader cancellation in MLB history (MLB) when lightning hit near home plate and umpire Bob Rice could not see.

"I never thought a baseball game would be called off because of weather," said longtime Mariner fan Jesse, who had hoped to catch Sunday's series against Oakland at T-Mobile Park with his family on vacation in the area for spring break this year. "Baseball has become such an important part of my life."

While safety is paramount when unpredictable weather strikes near a stadium, MLB officials are working to keep fans satisfied and hopeful about their next games by providing information through social media channels while the league's meteorologists review forecast models. In Seattle last night at Safeco Field:
- King County had issued wind warnings with speeds of up to 65 mph, expected between late tonight into early Monday morning before cooling temperatures set in around noon as rain continued throughout the daylight hours; this is consistent within MLB forecasts for western cities where warm and dry weather can shift quickly.
- Lightning strikes near home plate caused umpire Bob Rice to lose visibility, which led both teams into substitutions midway through today's first game at T-Mobile Park against Oakland while a rain delay allowed players extra time inside the dugout for preparation before being called back out onto the field when daylight faded.
- MLB officials stated that games would continue to be played Sunday afternoon provided no further weather concerns emerged and cautioned fans not forget about Wednesday's matchup as well since schedules can change quickly if forecasts shift unfavorably toward cooler conditions with potential storm systems developing across the northwestern U.S., which could bring an abrupt end to any baseball hopes for this weekend in Seattle.

"We understand that fans get attached and want their games back," said MLB spokesperson Joe, when asked about future schedules at T-Mobile Park if weather conditions improved tomorrow morning after early predictions of a sunny day had already begun shifting within 72 hours ago by NWS meteorologists. "We're doing our best to make the situation as bearable and safe for everyone involved."
