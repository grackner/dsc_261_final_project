In a bold move that shakes up Hollywood's award season plans, A-list actors Jennifer Lawrence and Brad Pitt announce they will not be attending this year's Oscars ceremony in person due to their personal commitments abroad on March 24th. The star-studded event has been anticipated for months with fans eagerly awaiting the red carpet appearances of Hollywood elites, but instead finds itself missing two high-profile figures that typically command attention at these gatherings.

Both Lawrence and Pitt are currently filming in foreign locations when they were set to attend; Lawrence is captivating audiences on a recent international tour while Pitt continues his latest project deep within the heart of London'tableau for which he received rave reviews upon its completion last month, writes Sarah Jennings.

The Oscars ceremony takes place in Los Angeles at the Dolby Theatre and has historically seen A-listers like Lawrence and Pitt attend to celebrate cinematic achievements with their peers; however, this year's show could be remembered for its conspicuous absence of such stars as much attention is now focused on local talent that will make up the event.

"While we understand Jennifer and Brad have important roles back at home during these significant times," said Oscars spokesperson Alexis Rodriguez, "the show goes on with a strong lineup of incredible artists delivering their much-anticipated performances." The Academy hopes to continue fostering inclusivity in the film industry by highlighting up-and-coming actors and directors during this year's ceremony.

"It’s been tough not seeing them there, but I respect Jennifer and Brad for prioritizing their commitments," said fellow actor Tom Hanks about his friends who have become household names worldwide over the years in conversation with journalist Jessica Lee on Thursday afternoon. "We understand how demanding film schedules can be."

Academy President Richard Brody remarked that while it is unfortunate to miss out on some of Hollywood's biggest stars, he was excited about what this year’s ceremony could bring forth for emerging talent and diverse storytellers in cinema. "This Oscars season has been more exciting than ever as we celebrate fresh perspectives," Brody stated during a press conference last week that highlighted several promising nominees outside the usual powerhouse sphere of actors who attend yearly ceremonies with regular frequency; it is hoped their absence could help to diversify and broaden what Hollywood recognizes at this esteemed event.

The Academy will continue its preparations for Sunday's ceremony, ensuring all nominated films are given a platform alongside some newcomers that have been making waves in the industry since the nominating period closed earlier this month after months of anticipation amongst enthusiast fans and critics alike; while Jennifer Lawrence and Brad Pitt may not be present to witness history or receive awards for their past successes, it appears Hollywood is opening its arms wider than ever before at a time when inclusivity has become more important now than perhaps any other period in the industry's evolution.
