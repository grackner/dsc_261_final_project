A severe storm system swept across eastern and southeeneral regions ofAustralia on Friday afternoon, causing extensive damage to properties in multiple counties includingLiverpool Plains near Tamworth in New South Wales as wellas disrupting transport networks nationwide with widespread flooding. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology has issued a severe weather warning for heavy rain and powerful winds that could last until early Saturday morning, according to the country's national forecast agency statement on Friday evening (AEST).

The storm system is currently heading towards Queensland before moving inland into Victoria later today. The impact so far includes downed trees across several suburbs ofSydney and Melbourne; flooded roads fromNew South Wales,QueenslandandVictoria to Tasmania's north coast where emergency services responders evacuated residents amid the rising water levels.

"The storm has been relentless for hours now," said meteorologist David Jones at the Bureau of Meteorology in Canberra on Friday afternoon while monitoring weather patterns with colleagues over a computer screen showing real-time radar images from different regions affected by this latest series of powerful winds and rainfall.

"It's one thing to experience an isolated thunderstorm, but when several systems come together like we have seen today it is truly devastating," Jones said as he watched the storm system moving towards southeastern Queensland where his team were actively monitoring its progress with great concern for those living in low-lying areas that could potentially be hit by flash floods.

The Bureau of Meteorology warned residents to take immediate action and seek shelter if needed, especially because water levels had already begun rising along the Hawkesbury River near Sydney's Blue Mountains National Park before noon on Friday. Authorities in New South Wales were urging people living in rural areas where flood-prone rivers run through their properties not only to be aware of current conditions but also prepare for more rain and possible evacuation as meteorologists predicted upcoming heavy rainfall into Saturday evening that could exacerbate the situation.

"We understand this is a very stressful time, especially when floodwaters are already affecting communities in several areas," said Premier Dominic Perrottet of New South Wales during his morning press conference from Sydney's Parliament House where officials coordinated emergency response efforts to help citizens who had been evacuated or stranded due to road closures caused by fallen trees and debris along the Princes Motorway near Kempsey.

The Premier said that more than 10,000 people have already sought shelter in local community centers across New South Wales' Mid-Western region while emergency services personnel were working hard to clear blocked roads amid heavy downpours and hail stones as large as golf balls reported by residents. In Victoria state on Friday afternoon alone the Department of Environment, Lands, Water, Green Industries & Tourism released a statement warning that 50 properties across multiple local government areas had suffered significant damage from wind-blown debris including fallen trees which brought down power lines and homes near Lake Bennett in Warrnamurra.

"We understand people are worried about what they will find when conditions improve tomorrow," Environmental Protection Authority Victoria director Andrew McKenzie told a press conference on Friday morning at State Emergency Operations Centre (SEOC) outsideMelbourne where officials were coordinating rescue efforts and assessing damage incurred by the storm system.
