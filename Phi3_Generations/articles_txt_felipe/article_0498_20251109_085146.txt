Melissa Johnson sat in a Los Angeles coffee shop on Monday evening, reflecting on how far her career as an aspiring filmmaker had come since auditioning for "City of Dreams," the upcoming thriller set to release nationwide next month across multiple screens simultaneously. Just months ago, she thought it was mere fantasy that could ever happen—but after securing a role and working closely with director Daniel Roberts on post-production last year at their Los Angeles studio office, Johnson felt confident about her future in Hollywood.

"I can't believe how much this experience has changed me," said the 25-year-energetic actress whose portrayal of an undercover FBI agent was praised by critics as "a tour de force performance." Now that she had a foot in mainstream cinema, Johnson aspired to leverage her newfound exposure for bigger roles with more challenging scripts.

"The success we've seen from 'City of Dreams,' I think it will open doors," added film critic Michael Thompson about the movie industry taking notice as he sipped his latte next to Johnson in Studio City, a neighborhood known historically and currently as Hollywood East, an area where countless dreamers once aspired their way into cinematic stardom.

Though "City of Dreams" is still awaiting final release numbers—with early estimates suggesting it could gross over $50 million domestically in its opening weekend alone—Johnson and her fellow castmates are basking joyfully amidst the studio lights, a stark contrast to their reality just six months ago when they weren't even sure if auditions were happening. The film had faced setbacks with fundraising issues but was now on track thanks largely to crowdfunded backers eager to see Johnson succeed and push her into stardom within the next year, should she choose that path following this project’s conclusion.

Director Daniel Roberts spoke of his excitement for how "City of Dreams" could launch a new era in mainstream filmmaking with fresh faces: “We want everyone who sees it to feel like they're part of something special—a movement." For Johnson, the opportunity came at an opportune time when she had just completed her coursework as an MFA Film graduate from UCLA and began looking for ways into acting. She saw in "City of Dreams" a way out of obscurity that many aspiring filmmakers have longed to find their breakthrough roles but few ever experience, despite the glamour Hollywood promises on social media influencers' posts featuring lavish sets or star-studded parties behind closed curtains.

The Los Angeles Times reported last week a crowdfunding campaign had already surpassed its goal of $50,000 in just five days since Johnson announced the project to her close friends and family on Instagram—a platform where she often shared thoughts about acting as well as behind-the-scenes glimpses into filmmaking from across Los Angeles. With each update post, a new wave of people would show interest not only by liking but also commenting with words like “congratulations” or "I'm proud you’re doing this."

“It just feels surreal,” Johnson confided to friends at her home studio in Silver Lake. She hoped the film, which takes audiences through a thrilling tale of an FBI agent on the hunt for terrorist threats across cities nationwide before uncovering conspiracies right
