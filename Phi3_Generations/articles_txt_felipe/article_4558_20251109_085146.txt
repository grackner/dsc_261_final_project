Hurricane Zephyr Makes Landfall with Unprecedented Force in Florida'selmost Record-Breaking Category  

At least two people were injured and dozens of homes are estimated to have been damaged as Hurricane Zephyr, a category four storm packing wind speeds upwards of 130 miles per hour (mph), roared ashore in the Florida panhandle early Thursday morning. The National Weather Service confirmed that no fatalities occurred but warned residents to remain vigilant as isolated incidents could continue through this weekend given the storm's slow movement and potential for heavy rainfall, with more than two inches forecasted overnight in some areas already affected by Zephyr.

Hurricane specialists at the National Hurricane Center (NHC) are tracking a disturbance off Florida’s southeast coast that developed into what they describe as "a very strong and dangerous hurricane" Wednesday night, CNN meteorologist Matt McGill reports. The storm has already knocked out power to tens of thousands across multiple counties before reaching land at about 7am local time Thursday with sustained winds clocking in around 130mph - the threshold for a category four hurricane on both the Saffir-Simpson and NHC scales.

Authorities have issued mandatory evacuation orders across all counties affected by Zephyr, urging residents to leave immediately before it's too late as emergency services prepare themselves for widespread damage throughout their jurisdictions while keeping an eye on the potential of flooding and downed trees that can pose immediate dangers.

"The storm has a slow speed but packing immense power - don’t wait if you are told to evacuate," said Governor Rick Scott in his statewide evening address Wednesday night, as he urged Floridians facing mandatory or voluntary orders to leave their homes ahead of the incoming monster.

Amid chaotic scenes at various evacuation centers, officials from multiple counties worked together to coordinate relief efforts following Zephyr's landfall. Emergency services have been deployed statewide and are keeping a close eye out for any potential casualties or flooding issues that may arise while local law enforcement is working tirelessly alongside first responders at the scene of reported incidents like cars being washed off roads by torrential rains in Panama City.

"I saw two vehicles stuck underwater and a tree crushed on my way to help out," shared rescue worker Sarah Thompson with The Miami Herald, adding that "it's been an unbelievably hard ride for everyone but we will come through this." 

Federal aid has already been requested by state officials as the damage is expected across broad areas of Florida affected inland from Panama City. In Tallahassee, Mayor Andrew Gillum announced that a Red Cross Disaster Response Team and two National Guard helicopters were en route to assist with relief efforts while his office coordinated volunteer groups on standby for additional help where needed once authorities deem it safe enough in the affected areas of Franklin, Gulf, Levy, Holmes Counties.
