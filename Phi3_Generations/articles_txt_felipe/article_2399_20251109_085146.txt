A massive flood disaster hit parts of South Yorkshire in England on Tuesday night as heavy rainfall triggered flash flooding across a wide area near Sheffield city center and the River Don estuary, reports CNN. As many areas remained underwater after record-breaking downpours began early yesterday afternoon that have been blamed for at least two deaths so far—the second such fatality since 2015 in this region according to local authorities' statements on Wednesday morning.

As per the South Yorkshire Emergency Services, multiple properties were severely damaged due to overflowing rivers and burst pipes; more than 30 roads remain impassable with debris scattered everywhere after residents evacuated their homes in a desperate attempt at safety from water cascading into houses. An emergency shelter has been established for displaced families near Sheffield city center by the government, as they work tirelessly to provide assistance and aid amidst this natural calamity—the second of its magnitude ever witnessed locally in recent years according to regional weather experts at MeteoGroup.

Emergency services are working around-the-clock on relief efforts with volunteers flocking from neighboring cities who heard the news through social media, as they try their best to keep calm amidst this unprecedented disaster situation—a local citizen witnessed a car being washed away near Rotherham town hall in his neighborhood just after midnight hours yesterday. "It is utterly shocking," said Mr John Smith (not the real name of an eyewitness), as he spoke to reporters outside the emergency center where people come for help seeking information on their lost belongings or shelter—his neighbor's house was one among those that vanished under murky water after rising levels caused a small stream at his backyard into becoming a raging torrent overnight.

"We are seeing historic floodwater in the area, but nothing like this before," said Dr Emily Taylor (not real name of an expert), Chief Meteorologist with MeteoGroup and witnessed from her own home just 30 miles north where she felt safe despite watching TV footage playing on national networks. "This is due to a strong low-pressure system pushing moist air out east, which brought in abundant rainfall for several days straight—it's the worst that we have seen this late into autumn since records began over 50 years ago according to our weather archives."

The flood has raised serious concerns among environmentalists and climate scientists who believe such natural disasters could become more frequent as global temperatures continue rising, notes a statement by World Wildlife Fund (WWF). "Our research indicates that we are likely seeing the direct impact of these extreme weather events being exacerbated by human-induced climate change," said WWF UK Chief Scientist Dr. David Balshaw in his address at an urgent press conference yesterday held alongside other leading environmental organizations, as they called for a comprehensive plan to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate such disasters' impact on communities across the globe—local governments are being forced to develop emergency action plans due to these increasingly unpredictable weather patterns.

A local resident displaced by floodwater said that "the fear of losing everything is real, but we have each other and will get through this tough time together," while the Sheffield councilor for Dore & Tot
