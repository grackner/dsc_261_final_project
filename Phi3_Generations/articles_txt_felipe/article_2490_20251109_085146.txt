In a small town in Vermont known for its vibrant food scene and local artisans, an unconventional culinary fair took place this past weekend that drew both locals and visitors alike to celebrate the unique flavors of New England cuisine. The annual 'Taste of Vermont' event showcased a variety of traditional dishes alongside innovative interpretations by local chefs on September 25, at Franklin County Fairgrounds in Stowe.


At the heart of this gathering was an array of hand-crafted maple syrups from various family farms that surrounded Vermont's picturesque landscape, offering over twenty varieties to a record number of eight thousand visitors who descended on what had been described as "the perfect autumnal escapade." The fair also highlighted artisan cheese makers and producers providing gourmet butters from farm-fresh cream.


"I've lived here all my life, and I thought it was time to put Vermont on the culinary map with our world-class cuisine," stated Sarah Jensen, head chef at one of the featured restaurants, Maple Leaf Haven. Attendees could indulge in signature dishes like wild mushroom risotto seasoned perfectly by local chefs and savory clams baked into a rustic potpie crust, all while enjoying live folk music under twinkling fairground lights on Saturday evening as part of the 'Farm-to-Table Fest.'


Reactions to this year's event were overwhlie positive. Longtime resident and frequent visitor Paul Thompson said: "It’s like stepping into a different world, one where you can taste everything Vermont has to offer." Officials from Franklin County praised the success of 'Taste of Vermont,' noting that it brought in $500,000 for local businesses and tourism this year alone.


As preparations continue for next year's event, organizers are already looking into expanding their offerings to include more international food stalls while maintaining the heart of Vermont’s homegrown flavors at the core – a testament to the state's commitment to celebrating its rich culinary heritage.
