Snowboarding in Japan to see a surge as people seek outdoor activities amid pandemic lockdown measures | CNN Travel

March 15, 2023 - Tokyo (CNN) -- As the world grapples with extended COVID-19 restrictions, Japanese travelers are finding solace and exhilaration in their beloved pastime of snowboarding. Amidst tightened lockdowns that have kept many confined to home bubbles within cities like Tokyo, a remarkable rise in ski resort visits is reported for the first quarter of 2curent_year--a trend mirrored by an uptick in international arrivals seeking snowy escapes.

Hiroshi Sato, owner of Yamagata's Frost Peak Resort shares his experience: "We have been fully booked ever since the restrictions were put into place three months ago." According to official data from Japan’s Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT), international snow tourists are up 40% compared with last year's numbers.

Amid reports on a global increase in indoor hobbies like video gaming or watching television at home -- activities that have been criticized for being socially isolating – Japan’s ski resort operators see an unmistakable silver lining to the pandemic cloud. The country, which has experienced one of its most successful virus containment efforts thus far in early 2023, is witnessing a snowboarder boom as people seek outdoor activities that keep them socially distanced yet feel connected with nature and other like-minded individuals within the realm of safe travel.

"Snowboarders have been social butterflies long before COVID came into play," says Sato, who has expanded his resort's facilities to accommodate more guests while maintaining a comfortable distance protocol for all visitors, "People are looking not only for adventure and the thrill of snowboarding but also genuine human connection."

The MLIT reported that local businesses associated with winter sports tourism across Japan have seen an 80% increase in revenue since the pandemic's first wave hit. Frost Peak Resort alone has boosted its staff from a handful of workers to over thirty, hired just to cater to the surging crowds throughout March and beyond – which many experts believe is not only a direct economic benefit but also serves as an important psychological coping mechanism for locals enduring prolonged pandemic-related anxiety.

Dr. Kenji Tanaka from Tokyo's Institute of Psychology explains, "Taking part in outdoor activities like ski tourism can help mitigate feelings of isolation and boredom due to stay-at-home orders." This psychological uplift is seen as a necessary boost for both physical and mental wellbeing during challenging times.

Sato says that beyond the obvious love they have always shared with snowboarders, "What resonates most now are stories of resilience against these unprecedented circumstances.” The sight of people from different corners of Japan embracing winter sports as a lifeline has touched many hearts and sparked inspiration.

As lockdowns may extend well into the second quarter of 2023, locals and international travelers alike are looking for reasons to continue living life amid restrictions -- with snowboarding taking center stage at Frost Peak Res
