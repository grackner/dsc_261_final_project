An extravagant lifestyle just got a little more luxurious for one New York City mogul as their latest acquisition hits record prices at auction house Sotheby's this Thursday evening in Manhattan, September 15th.

In a bustling city where fashion often dictates public perception, New Yorkers were taken aback yesterday when an anonymous luxury collector unveiled their latest acquisition: A palatial residence boasting 50 rooms spanning over two interconnected mansions in Manhattan's exclusive Fifth Avenue.

One can hardly imagine what kind of parties might take place here given that it is also equipped to host up to 100 guests in its extravagant dining rooms alone; where fine wine flow and jazz ensembles once strung their final notes before the night came too close for comfort on any such
