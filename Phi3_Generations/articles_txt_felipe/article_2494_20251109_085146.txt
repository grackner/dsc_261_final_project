A fitness app developer has announced a new feature designed to help people with physical disabilities engage in personalized workout plans tailored specifically for their needs and abilities. Called "EmpowerFit," the innovative application offers adaptive exercluses, custom-paced routines, and virtual trainers who specialize in various conditions such as paraplegia or amputation after accidents like car crashes.

The unveiling took place last week during a press conference at TEDxWashingtonDC with representatives from the creator's company — FlexTech Innovations, Inc., based out of New York City — and disability advocates in attendance to provide feedback on their needs for inclusivity.

According to Dr. Susan Choi, a leading geriatric physical therapist at Johns Hopkins Medicine Center who was also present during the event: "EmpowerFit represents an enormous leap forward towards ensuring that everyone can exercise safely and comfortably in their own environment." She added with excitement about EmpowerFit's potential, saying, "Not only does it enable individuals to maintain fitness levels but helps prevent secondary health complications often seen among the disabled population living sedentary lives such as obesity or high blood pressure. This is an amazing opportunity for everyone involved."

The new program has been two years in development and was tested on more than 200 users over a six-month period, which saw significant improvements across different fitness levels including flexibility, strength, balance, coordination as well cardiovascular endurance. FlexTech Innovations plans to launch the program globally later this year through its website and mobile platforms such as iOS App Store or Google Play Marketplace with an initial pricing plan available at a reduced cost for those enrolled in their ongoing health insurance programs.

"We hope that EmpowerFit will break down barriers not just physically but also socially by creating community connections amongst the users and fostering new relationships based off shared fitness goals," said James Walker, CEO of FlexTech Innovations, as he wrapped up his presentation on stage.

The launch comes at a time when research suggests that physical activity can reduce stress levels among those with disabilities by providing them an outlet for mental and emotional wellbeing; thus making the overall improvement in health more comprehensive than just strengthening muscles or improving heart conditions alone which is typically how conventional workout programs are designed.

EmpowerFit has already garnered interest from fitness clubs nationwide seeking to promote inclusivity within their establishments, as well as various rehabilitation centers aiming for better engagement with clients during recovery journeys after traumatic injuries like strokes or spinal cord accidents.

"As someone who has personally experienced the challenges of staying active despite my physical limitations due to a motor vehicle accident many years ago, I can't help but feel encouraged by FlexTech Innovations stepping up their efforts in improving accessibility for all users," said Robert Smith, one such fitness club manager who recently partnered with EmpowerFit.

The initiative has been praised as an important step towards more accessible workout programs but also reminders that this is just the beginning of much-needed changes in inclusive practices and policies within many industries including healthcare, transportation or education sectors which still often lack accommodations for differently able
