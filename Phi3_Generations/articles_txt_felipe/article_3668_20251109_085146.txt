Nearby residents express concern over a sudden outbreak of relationship conflicts in local community centers across Atlanta on Thursday evening that has health officials worried about potential mental and emotional well-betermis impacts, as couples struggle to manage the effects of living under quarantine. The growing tensions have left experts baffled by an increasing number of reported breakups attributed directly or indirectly to extended time spent in close quarters with partners during pandemic lockdown measures imposed last March due to COVID-19 restrictions, per Atlanta Community Health Department spokesperson Dr. Angela Brooks who confirmed that reports have doubled compared to earlier this year as relationships strain under the weight of constant togetherness and limited escape routes for couples trying to maintain peace in their shared space: "The isolation has brought about a myriad stressors directly linked with relationship satisfaction, from financial issues due to job losses or cuts that continue even though things seem less dire now as unemployment rates begin dropping steadily over the past few months; communication breakdown is not an option when there's no one else around except for your significant other—how do two people find common ground without external distractions, yet being cooped up at home makes arguments inevitable?" A couple of Atlanta residents who opted to separate after almost four years together shared their story with CNN; “We were always a strong team but as the months passed and nothing changed outside our windows we felt more like roommates than partners," explained Emily Clark, 32.

Dr. James Harden from Relationship Psychology Center has been working closely with local couples counseling centers to provide virtual therapy sessions for those struggling; “As mental health professionals are aware of these emerging issues within relationships during this period we believe it’s essential that support systems become more accessible not just in the traditional way but through technology-facilitated means as well. We have observed an increase from 50 to over a hundred requests per week since last April with our team taking additional efforts trying out different online modes of communication and therapy delivery methods - something we believe will help mitigate some negative repercussions in the long run, especially amongst younger couples who are more likely familiarizing themselves within digital realms," said Harden.

As lockdown measures ease gradually with vaccination rates increasing across Atlanta which has reached a national average of 50% as per CDC data last month and experts advise on caution before resuming normal life activities, the city’s relationships expert warns that there could be lingering effects in some cases; "It's important for couples to communicate effectively from day one when planning their time together outside of home after being apart due lockdown restrictions but it can take years or more than just a few weeks before certain relationship aspects return back fully as people continue healing emotionally and rebuilding trust," said Dr. Harden who predicts an increase in family-related issues arising from divorcees remarrying amidst the pandemic - which have seen doubled requests for marriage counseling sessions at his Center last year alone with over forty couples seeking help, as reported by Atlanta Community Health Department records on Thursday morning.
