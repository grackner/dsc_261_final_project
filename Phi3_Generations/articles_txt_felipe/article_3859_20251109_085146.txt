In a startling revelation on March 10th, officials in Siem Reap City revealed that their local tourism industry has been under threat from an invasive plant species known as the Water Hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes). Originating from South America and first noticed around Lake Tonle Sap two years ago, this fast-spreading aquatic weed now covers vast stretener regions of waterways frequented by international tourists.

Tourism authorities estimate that the sprawling mats have affected approximately 40% of accessible lakefront businesses over recent months as boats can no longer navigate through thick carpets of green, turning day-trippers into lost souls amid a sea of flora and fauna disrupted by this foreign interloper.

Mayor Sok Pheaktheab warned that if the situation does not improve soon enough to control an outbreak spreading across two years ago from neighboring Vietnam, Cambodia's prime tourist destination will suffer a severe economic blow: "We must tackle these threats immediately before we see irreparable damage," he urged in a press conference.

Ecotourism expert Dr. Vanna Chhun says the plant can double its coverage area within just 10 days during peak growing season, causing unprecedented turmoil for local ecosystems and businesses alike: "This invasive species poses not only a navigational hazard but also threatens biodiversity. It's crucial we find an effective way to remove it without harming the native flora."

Clean-up efforts are underway with local volunteers, alongside government and international experts collaborating on biological control methods that aim to curb further growth of this troublesome species while maintaining a healthy lake ecosystem. As authorities continue their struggle against this unwanted guest threatening Cambodia's economic backbone – tourism - citizens like hotel manager Sophal Sok recommends caution: "We need sustainable solutions that protect both our economy and the environment."

Further details on these efforts will be provided in forthcoming press releases.
