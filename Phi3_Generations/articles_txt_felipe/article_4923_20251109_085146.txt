A massive snowstorm has hit New York City this weekend causing travel chaos and numerous road closures across Manhattan's boroughs as of Monday morning. The National Weather Service issued a blizzard warning for the city overnight, predicting up to two feet of accumulating snow in some areas with wind speeds reaching 35mph at times on Friday night into Saturday afternoon (local time).

Commuters and residents woke up early yesterday morning facing treacherous travel conditions as emergency crews worked around the clock clearing roads, sidewalks, bridges, and tunnels. Over twenty-five inches of snow were recorded in Central Park this weekend alone—the highest since 2015 when recordings started being kept for such events by New York City'thy Meterological Department (NYTMD).

"This is beyond anything I have seen," remarked NY Mayor Eric Adams during a live press conference late Friday evening, urging citizens to avoid non-essential travel and remain indoors if possible. "The safety of our city residents comes first."

Traffic delays extended well into the early hours as plows struggled against strong wind gusts that whipped snow in unpredictable patterns—creating hazardous conditions even after clearing efforts had eased traffic congestion somewhat. Public transportation services, including subways and buses across all five boroughs were disrupted intermittently; however some of them resumed normal schedules by early morning hours on Sunday before being suspended again later that day due to worsening weather conditions predicted for Monday afternoon into Tuesday night (local time).

According to officials, over 60 snowstorm-related accidents occurred within the city during these events resulting in multiple injuries and three fatalities among them. Many schools closed yesterday after classes were cancelled earlier due to unsafe commute conditions while some offices followed suit but not without causing significant backlogs at workplaces leading employers like Amazon, Facebook, Google parent Alphabet Inc., Pfizer etc. announced flexible working arrangements for their employees affected by the storm (The Guardian).

"It is heart-wrenching to see how much damage this weather has caused," said local business owner Rachel Kim in a recorded video clip shared on social media yesterday where she described witnessing piles of shattered glass from storefronts, damaged signboards and smashed vehicle windshields after heavy hail descended upon her Brooklyn shop during rush hour traffic delays caused by snowfall.

As more frigid weather is predicted to hit New York City next week with upcoming blizzards likely continuing through Tuesday night, city officials have warned residents that conditions may become even worse and urged them once again not only refrain from travel but also stay updated via official communications channels for regular daily advisories.

"We will continue working closely together as a community," Mayor Adams emphasized during his press conference yesterday while encouraging neighbors to check up on each other's safety, especially elderly and vulnerable residents who require additional support in such extreme weather events (WJLA).
