A major hotel in Las Vegas has been forced to evacuate guests following reports of a potential threat within its premises last night at approximately 7 p.m. local time, prompting authorities and the property management team into immediate action as they investigate what is believed to be an unidentified object found near guest rooms on El Mirage Road on Wednesday morning.

The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority (LCVA) issued a statement late yesterday evening confirming that multiple reports from guests had raised concerns about the suspicious item, which was first noticed around 10 p.m., roughly halfway through the night's last performances at nearby attractions like Bellagio Fountain Show and The Wickedest Man in Las Vegas comedy club.

According to hotel spokespner Diana Rodriguez-Martinez, guests were immediately alerted about an 'unidentified item detected near their rooms' as they finished dinner at the Grand Vesper Buffet Restaurant located on 140 El Mirage Road (approximately two miles from Caesars Palace). "We acted quickly upon discovering it," she said.

Rodriguez-Martinez, who had just concluded her shift as a hotel concierge at approximately six in the evening when reports started circulating among guests regarding an unidentified object near their rooms on El Mirage Road that could have posed potential danger to them and staff members alike. "I heard hushed whispers from several tables around me about something strange being found close by, so I alerted hotel security," she recounts of the incident unfolding before her eyes as guests looked towards their rooms with growing anxiety throughout dinner service at Grand Vesper Buffet Restaurant.

As word quickly spread across different sections within Grandeur Hotel through whispers among staff members in break areas, and between servers carrying plates out front where waitresses could see panicked expressions on guest faces alighting their orders for takeout only after being informed about the potentially hazardous object located near room 1523B - a popular suite sought by high-rolling gamblers at this upscale Vegas hotel.

Security personnel promptly arrived shortly thereafter as guests continued to seek answers on what was causing alarm throughout their dining experience with some stating it felt like everyone else knew something about the mysterious find, while others claimed they were clueless until management took control of guest information sharing and redirected anxious concerns towards hotel security for a thorough investigation.

A source close to LCVV staff tells DailyMailOnline that authorities have been notified already but would prefer guests maintain their stay as per normal protocol unless the situation escalates further beyond initial reports which could lead them on how best moving forward; however, Rodriguez-Martinez expressed confidence in her colleagues saying: "I don't believe anything bad will happen to anyone here and I think we have excellent security measures at place."

Experts say such findings are uncommon but not impossible as longs range of objects found within Las Vegas often come back up on display or returned after being checked out by casual visitors. "We see these kinds of things occasionally, especially around high-traffic areas like Sin City where tourists bring in all sorts of items," says Dr. Amelia Harris, an expert from the University of Nevada's Department of Anthropology who has studied human behavior and lost property recovery over decades but was not involved with this specific incident at Grandeur
