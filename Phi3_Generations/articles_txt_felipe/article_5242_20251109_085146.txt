Snowboarder's Rescue in Whistler Mountains Requires Specialized Helicopter Team and Weather Delays Deployment for Two Days

Whistler - A snowboarding competition participant was safely airlifted from the treacherous terrains of the Canadian Rockies after being stranded overnight, prompting praises across various sports communities. The 24-year-energetic competitor found himself in a precarious position on Friday afternoon while attempting an advanced jump near Whistler Mountain. After hours lost searching for his misplaced snowboard and finding no trace of the marked trail back to camp, he decided it was safer to wait there until dawn rather than risk further delays under poor visibility conditions caused by fresh powderfalling from a storm predicted to pass within 24 hours; unfortunately, an unexpected weather setback postponed his rescue for two days.

As of Saturday afternoon at approximately three-thirty PM PST, the snowboarder remains missing and is feared critically injured after being found unconscious by chance in a partially buried vehicle on Friday evening near Cougar Peak Trailhead—a well-known spot among local athletes but notorious for its deceptive landscape under freshly fallen snow. The rescue operation, involving the British Columbia Ambulance Service and Search & Rescue team from nearby Squamish Volunteer Fire Department's air assets has been ongoing since midnight Saturday with an estimated 25-member search party combing through roughly two square miles of backcountry terrain in a temperate rainforest environment.

Local Sheriff Michael Brown commented, "This is certainly one of the most challenging rescue missions I've ever seen; it reminds us that winter sports can be unpredictable and unforgiving when conditions change rapidly." The searchers are using snowmobiles for better maneuverability through deeper drifts while employing thermal imaging cameras to help locate the missing individual.

A witness, professional photographer Sarah Johnson who was documenting local wildlife at Twin Falls Campground said she spotted something flickering briefly on a distant hillside around four PM Friday as darkness began closing in earlier than anticipated due to an early snowstorm warning issued by Environment Canada forecaster Daniel Stevens. "It looked like somebody trying frantically for their board," recalled Johnson, whose own gear was rapidly becoming soaked through heavy showers accompanied by howling winds from the storm front that hit British Columbia with unprecedented ferocity in recent weeks causing several power outages across communities north of Vancouver. "I knew immediately this couldn't have been a good sign as I heard him call for help over and over again."

A spokesperson for Parks Canada, who asked to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity surrounding search operations involving loved ones at risk commented later on Saturday that rescuers had identified potential signs of injury such as broken bones from a fall. "We understand how stressful this situation must be for families with individuals stranded in areas frequently visited by tourists, yet rarely used during peak season," the source said before cautioning visitors to stay informed about weather conditions and trail closures ahead when heading out into remote backcountry wilderness regions of British Columbia's vast landscape.

A rescue helicopter from Whistler Mountain Base is expected at noon Sunday, with air support set up in coordination by Canadian Armed Forces specialists based on a recommendation issued yesterday
