A military coup in Nigeria appears to have succeeded as troops took control of government buildings throughout Lagos on Monday morning local time. This unexpected turn of events has caught citizens and officials alike off guard amidst the backdrop of economic instability within the nation, which is one of Africa's most populous countries with a GDP contributing over 10% to that continent’ end total output as per last year's figures from African Development Bank.

The military reportedly stormed into key government locations early Monday after weeks of unrest in response to allegations against the sitting president, who has now sought refuge at his private residence outside Lagos following security personnel closing off access routes leading up to it. Nigerian Armed Forces Spokesman, Major General Yusuf Ahmad responded when asked about reports on state television today that they had taken full control of government institutions saying only 'security issues' were involved and the military was not interfering in politics at this time.

A witness who went by the name Abiola shared her observations with reporters present during one episode where tensions escalated around Government House: "I saw soldiers carrying shields approaching from all directions, I could hear shouts before they closed down access routes leading to it."

Experts stress that while the focus now should be restoring normalcy, addressing underlying issues causing discontent among citizens can prevent further escalations in violence like this one if unchecked long-term effects aren't mitigated accordingly afterwards too soon into coming months until concrete steps are taken towards tangible reforms.

As we move forward with these unfolding events happening on our African soil, many nations stand firmly behind Nigeria as it navigates through its crisis hoping that common people won’t pay for their leaders' struggles but instead unite under shared goals and visions fostering progress not only nationally but continent-wide. International Monitoring Group chief observer Charles Gacheteke says: "Let us hope stability returns soon to Nigeria as we continue providing support during this trying period while keeping an open dialogue channel with all parties involved, including the military leadership."

In response President Muhammadu Buhari urged citizens across various parts of Lagos and Abuja city centers where he spent time speaking directly via live streaming today saying: "I implore Nigerians not
