A significant cache of arms believed to have originated from Iran has been seized in Yemen, sparking concerns over regional stability and fueling fears among Sunni militias already embroiled in conflict with Shiite Houthis backed by Tehran. The find came following an intelligence tip-off that led to the discovery of weapons at a local arms depot near Sana'a last Friday evening, March 15th.

The armaments are estimated to have been smuggled into Yemen several months ago and included rifles capable of firing shoulder-fired rockets known as RPGs or anti-tank missiles such as the TOW. Additionally, a variety of handguns were found among the cache – weapons widely used by insurgent groups in recent years within this volatile region.

The Yemeni government has condemned any support for armed actors that could threaten national security and stability while reiterating its efforts to restore order amidst ongoing conflict since 2decade ago, backed initially as part of a Saudi-led coalition against the Houthis but now exacerbated by Iran's interference.

"The presence of these arms in our territory is unacceptable and poses an immediate threat to Yemeni security," said General Abdulmalik al-Houthani, Head of Intelligence Services at a press conference yesterday. "We are taking all necessary steps for their safe removal." 

Yemen's armed groups have been locked in conflict with the Houthi rebels since late 2014 when they took control over key cities and infrastructure following disputes between Shia-led political parties backed by Iran against Sunni forces loyal to exiled President Abdu Rabbuh Mansour Hadi. In March last year, a military operation aimed at recapturing the Red Sea port city of Hudayah ended in failure after Yemeni troops suffered heavy losses amid fierce resistance from Houthis and their allies backed by Tehran-based proxies including Lebanese Hezbollah militants.

Several sources told CNN that weapons believed to have been smuggled into the country were found among hundreds of tons of cargo seized during a raid at an arms depot in Shaqra, Yemen's main port city and capital of Sanaa region where Houthis maintain control since Hadi was forced out by protesters earlier this year. The seizure comes amid escalating tensions between regional powers Saudi Arabia-led Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) forces against Iran-backed Shiite rebels and their proxies across the Middle East including Lebanon, Iraq, Syria as well as ongoing U.S.-Iran negotiations in Vienna aiming to ease economic sanctions imposed following Tehran's disputed nuclear program launch back in 2015 that sparked international concerns about possible weaponization capabilities by the Islamic Republic of Iran (IRI).

In a statement, Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan said: "Saudi Arabia remains committed to resolving Yemen's crisis through dialogue and diplomacy with all parties in accordance with UN resolution 2370." The foreign minister added that his country continues to support humanitarian efforts aimed at alleviating suffering of millions displaced by conflict.
