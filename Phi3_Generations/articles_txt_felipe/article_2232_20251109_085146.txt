A sudden and severe snowstorm hit New York City yesterday evening, disrupting transportation systems across Manhattan as authorities rushed to restore normalcy amid concerns over potential infrastructure damage. Over the course of six hours between Sunday night into Monday morning, at least five inches of accumulated snow paralyzed road traffic with some areas seeing more than two feet in depth by Tuesday afternoon. The National Weather Service had issued warnings as temperatures remained well below freezing throughout last weekend's outbreak which was highly unusual for the metropolitan area during this time of year, according to a report from AccuWeather meteorologist John Jaso on CNN Newsource.

"Snowfall is typically rare in early December and even more infrequent at temperatures below freezing," said Jaso who noted that conditions set records for cold air masses moving into the region before settling overnight to create a perfect storm of ice crystals within clouds, resulting in heavy snowfalls across New York City.

Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted yesterday morning urging residents not to travel as crews worked around-thein freeze and shoveled foot after foot outside city hospitals while the MTA struggled with service delays ranging from minutes-long disruing all way hours. In a live press conference, de Blasio said: "Our priority is getting everyone out safe as well as ensuring our essential services are running smoothly," before adding that emergency repairs were being conducted on the subway tracks throughout Manhattan with no set timeline for full restoration of service expected.

City Department of Environmental Protection spokesperson, Danielle Sculese confirmed early Monday morning crews worked tirelessly to keep sewage flowing and avoid backups in basements amid a deluge of accumulated meltwater pouring down into the streets below after daylight hours began. "We are clear on what we need to do but it is all dependent upon Mother Nature as our next steps will vary based upon temperatures," said Sculese while noting that freezing conditions had already been detected in parts of Queens and Brooklyn overnight Tuesday morning with the forecast calling for an additional six hours of snow by early afternoon.

Residents reported seeing plows working constantly throughout Sunday night into Monday as many began digging out their driveways, sidewalks or simply taking refuge inside until temperatures warmed up enough to venture outside without fear of slipping on ice-covered streets after the sudden cold snap that left New York City's Central Park with over 24 inches by Tuesday afternoon. The MTA announced a full transit shutdown would be in effect for several hours beginning Wednesday until midnight, leaving many stranded across town including commuters traveling to Long Island as well as visitors who had come downtown on vacation or business trips since New York City's hotels and tourist attractions were quickly filling up with guests over the past weekend.

"I came here for a conference, but it turned into an adventure in staying warm," said Sarah Johnson of Boston while standing outside at Grand Central Station on Monday morning watching snowplows work around her as she waited to catch Amtrak home later that day after spending Friday through Sunday enjoying time with family and friends before the cold front hit, according to a rep for The Westin Wall Street NYC Hotel where Ms. Johnson had stayed last weekend while in town on business.
