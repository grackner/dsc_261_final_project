In a stunning turn of events that has rocked Hollywood's Golden Globe awards ceremony this year in Los Angeles on January 25th, Oscar-winning actress Elizabeth Sterling announced she is withdrawing from the industry due to personal reasons and taking an extended break. The highly anticipated event saw fanfare but also a sense of uncertainty with news about Sterling breaking out beforehand that had many believing her absence would significantly impact this year's ceremony as well, given her notable achievements in film over recent years.

Elizabeth has long been hailed for taking on challenging roles and delivering powerful performances; however, the details of what she termed a "serious family matter" were never shared with media at large until now when an official statement released earlier today confirms that Elizabeth will take this time off to focus entirely on her health. This announcement came as no surprise given rumors circulating in Beverly Hills and Hollywood over the past couple of weeks, which had fans questioning if she would make it through what was supposed to be a night filled with celebrations honoring excellence within entertainment.

Elizabeth's representative spoke about her decision today: "It is important for us as Elizabeth Sterling that we prioritize our well-being above all else," the spokesperson said, adding, "We understand this news might disappoint many people who were looking forward to celebrating with Lizzy."

Despite not being on stage in Los Angeles at last night's Golden Globe awards ceremony - her first absence since 2015 and it was anticipated that the actress would be among those getting a standing ovation for their work. Friends, colleagues and fans are saddened by Elizabeth’s decision but supportive of what they understand to be necessary measures concerning family matters she has been dealing with in recent months as well.

Sterling's representative also mentioned that there is no concrete timeline yet on when Lizzy would return, saying "We will keep this confidential for now". This comes after a couple of weeks ago Sterling had expressed her excitement to share details about what has been keeping her away from the spotlight. She joked in an interview with People Magazine that fans may find out more as she'll be sharing some photos and videos on Instagram once it becomes appropriate, but nothing specific came across yet today after this announcement was made publicly available by Elizabeth’s representatives via press release sent to major news networks including CNN.

Hollywood Insider spoke with a source who attended one of the events where Sterling had been present last year and remarked: "Elizabeth has always captivated us more than just her acting prowess; it's that special warmth we get from talking about these beautiful ladies backstage which makes them so lovable in this town." This statement underscores Elizabeth’s importance to fans beyond the screen, reminding viewers of how personal struggles can affect even those who seemingly have everything.

It remains uncertain if other celebrities will attend future events while Lizzy takes a break from acting and celebrity life as she navigates this difficult time for her family; however many stars showed up last night despite the uncertainty over Sterling's status, with hosts George Clooney and Tina Fey bringing warmth to their usually glitz-and-glam environment. Actress Halle Berry was on hand sharing a stage with Lizzy at one point in time during her career together as friends but now finds herself more than happy
