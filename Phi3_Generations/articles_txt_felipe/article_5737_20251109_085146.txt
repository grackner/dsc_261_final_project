A massive fire broke out in a London high-rise building early this morning, engulfing over half of the 20th floor and displacing dozthy families as emergency services worked to bring it under control. The blaze at the Regent House complex on Brompton Road started around 5:30 am local time with a suspected electrical fault in one of the apartments, according to firefighters who arrived quickly from various London stations upon receiving an initial report just before sunrise.

The building is home to approximately 150 residents and businesses operating out of its ground-floor commercial units – most notably a popular bakery that drew crowds regularly over the past year as they awaited opening in their new location on upper floors, anticipated last summer but delayed due to renovation.

Residents woke up startled by blaring sirens and flashing lights around 6:05 am when fire engines from London Fire Brigade's Ladder Section swarmed onto the scene like a choreographed dance of metal giants working in unison – yet there was no immediate explanation as to how exactly or why it all happened. Ambulance crews arrived shortly after, with some people injured and trapped upstairs reportedly being assessed for potential smoke inhalation damage while others were evacuated via the only safe stairwell amid heavy fire suppression efforts taking place overhead on floors still burning out of control above them – all within a span that seemed to stretch from dawn till dusk as hours passed without resolution.

"It's been tough for everyone involved," said Rachel Green, an 18-year old resident who woke up hearing alarms blare downstairs; she had stayed quiet and kept her bedroom door closed until the smoke started seeping underneath as well – something that happened around noon after several hours of waiting for help while feeling increasingly desperate. "It's just a shock, you know? My family has lived here since we were kids... We never had to deal with anything like this."

A spokesman from the London Fire Brigade confirmed initial assessments that they believed electrical issues may have played some role in sparking off such an extensive blaze across multiple floors but stressed there was no conclusive evidence yet – work continues underwatered skies on today's second floor, with temperatures hovering around 64 degrees Fahrenheit. Meanwhile emergency crews worked relentlessly to save any possible survivable units while securing the building from potential aftershock outbreak by closing off ventilation ducts and cutting electricity supply as they made their way towards extinguishing what looked like a never-ending inferno that threatened not only personal properties but also those of local businesses, including popular bakery owner James Wilson who has been serving delicious treats for years to the very same neighbors living in this high-rise.

"It's just terrible," said Ms Linda Roberts from next door whose own apartment was now without power and had not received any help despite her calling nonstop since waking up hours ago with an uneasy feeling of things being wrong – something she couldn't shake off as if sensing the disaster unfold around them like some sort of eerie premonition. "I never thought I'd see such destruction in my own community... We were all friends here before, and now it feels so divided."
