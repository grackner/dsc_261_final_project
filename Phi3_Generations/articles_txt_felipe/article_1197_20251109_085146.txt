A severe weather event swept through the southern United States on Tuesday afternoon, causing widespselr damage and disruption in multiple states with hail as large as grapefruits reported by residents and authorities alike. This rare occurrence was observed primarily across Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, the District of Columbia as well as Puerto Rico and parts of Florida.

Heavy thunderstorms with severe hailstones were witnessed early Tuesday afternoon in Wichita Falls (Texas), which caused considerable damage to vehicles parked outside without any protection from such weather events. "I saw the sky turn a dark shade as large ice balls started pounding our town, and I knew it was time to take cover," said local resident Sarah Thompson, recalling how people rushed indoors or took shelter under overpasses just in case these hailstones turned out larger than expected. 

At the height of this unusual weather phenomenon on Tuesday afternoon near Oklahoma City (Oklahoma), one person was reported critically injured after being hit by a large rock dislodged from an embankment due to intense winds associated with thunderstorm activity, which scientists say were fueled in part by the exceptionally hot and dry conditions present over much of the region. 

Meteorologist Mark Davis at the National Weather Service office said such hailstorm situations are not common but can happen when "a combination of ingredients like a strong cold front colliding with warm, moist air come together." He added that experts have noted this weather pattern as an increasing risk factor due to climate change.

The sudden onset and severity of the hailstorm led officials in Louisiana's Jefferson Parish Emergency Operations Center quickly opening their shelters for displaced residents, with shelter capacity reaching 50% within hours according to Director Mary Dupree. "We opened our doors because we knew these storms could cause significant harm," said Ms. Dupree while checking on evacuees in the overcrowded center which housed nearly a thousand people by evening Tuesday, mostly elderly and low-income families with limited transportation options left outside without adequate shelter amidst pouring rain from passing storm fronts.

In Georgia's Albany County Emergency Management office, Disaster Services Director Linda Harris said their shelters have been consistently near capacity since Monday evening as residents sought refuge ahead of the expected impact zone for Tuesday afternoon thunderstorm activity; this had already prompted local authorities to declare a state of emergency last weekend when forecasts predicted possible tornado formation within days' notice.
 
As meteorologists continue studying these events and gathering data about their increasing frequency, climate scientists are emphasizing the urgent need for better preparedness plans considering potential impacts on communities already disproportionately affected by environmental injustices; a spokesp0erson from National Climate Assessment commented that "this year alone has seen an unusually high number of hailstorm incidents across several states, suggesting our climate patterns are changing rapidly," urging for immediate action to mitigate future risks. 

Emergency personnel in both Louisiana and Georgia have begun reviewing their evacuation plans with local officials while working collaboratively
