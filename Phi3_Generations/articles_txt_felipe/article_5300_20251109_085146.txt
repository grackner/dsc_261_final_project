In a groundbrethy recent decision affecting international travelers, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced on Monday that visa waivers for citizens from countries with low rates of COVID-19 infections will be reinstated starting August 20th. The revival follows months of stringent entry restrictions and is welcomed by many who have been separated from family members abroad due to the travel bans imposed since late last year, CNN reports.

"With continued progress against COVID-19 globally, it's time for our nation to move forward on international engagement," Blinken said during a press conference held in Washington D.C. He further added that countries with low rates of coronavirus cases have "significantly lowered the risk of transmission" and can safely reintegrate into travel exchanges, CNN reported.

According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which are continuously being updated throughout this pandemic period, only a handful countries with low rates continue to have cases that exceed 50 per million people — namely Iceland at just above this threshold. Meanwhile, other nations like Australia, South Korea, New Zealand among others boast far lower figures of less than ten COVID-19 infections for every one million inhabitants as reported by the CDC's most recent data available on August 5th and last updated throughout July weekends.

Travel experts weighed in with their thoughts about this decision, saying it is a positive step forward that can help ease global travel concerns without compromising safety measures. "It feels good to see people getting back together again after being apart for so long," said Jane Smithson, senior director of the Association of International Educators (AIE). She shared how many AIE members had been separated from their overseas students due to this policy and expressed relief at its reversal.

In addition, Dr. John Doe, a Harvard-educated epidemiologist working as an independent consultant for the World Health Organization (WHO), added that countries showing significant progress in containing COVID-19 should not be penalized with extended travel bans any longer than necessary and can adopt stringent safety measures to prevent local transmission upon arrival. He stated, "This decision opens up a lot of possibilities but requires careful planning around public health concerns."

The new visa waiver program will primarily benefit nationals from the countries mentioned earlier as well as some additional nations like Japan, South Africa, and Israel — all having lower rates per capita in comparison to others. Blinken stressed that this policy change is only for short-term travel purposes initially due to high demand but said more details would be shared at a later date when necessary steps are taken into consideration regarding the duration of stays allowed under these waivers, CNN reports.

The announcement has been met with reactions from multiple corners — both optimistic and cautious alike - as people across all backgrounds eagerly anticipate reunions while others remain concerned about potential resurgences amid relaxed restrictions on international travel, DailyMail notes the news outlet reporting this story. As for now, many continue to hope that these new visa waivers will enable more families and friends to connect with each other once again as they prepare themselves physically and mentally for their reunions while taking necessary precautions into consideration such as frequent hand washing or wearing masks when required in public spaces.

It remains unclear how long the rev
