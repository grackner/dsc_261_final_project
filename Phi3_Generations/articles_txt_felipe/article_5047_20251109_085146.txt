Atlanta – As the world grapples with an ever-increasing demand for mental health care services amidst growing stressors of modern life, a leading hospital network in Atlanta has taken a pioneering step towards addressing this concern. The Augusta General Hospital announced yesterday its initiative to integrate 'mindful medicine' into standard care practices as part of efforts to enhance patient well-being and the overall healthcare system’s efficacy.

Since January, all medical staff at East Coast Hospitals have been trained in mindfulness techniques with aims to reduce burnout rates that continue to plague frontline workers across various states according to recent surveys by The Washington Post National Health Policy Report (2023). Mindful medicine involves incorporating brief sessions of meditation and focused breathing exercises during clinical visits, which have been shown in several studies published in the Journal for the American Medical Association (JAMA) to reduce anxiety levels among patients.

Dr. Emily Clarkson, a leading mind-body medicine specialist who is part of Augusta General Hospital's Mindful Medicine team said that “the intention here isn’t just about patient treatment but creating an environment where empathy and connection are at the heart of care.” In addition to providing immediate relief for patients during appointments with primary healthcare providers, mindful medicine sessions also enable physicians like Dr. Clarkson to better manage their stress levels in between patient interactions throughout hectic shifts.

“Mindfulness not only benefits our physical and mental well-being but it can significantly improve communication among caregivers by reducing implicit bias,” explains Professor Andrew Lee, a cognitive psychologist with expertise on mindfulness at the University of Georgia who recently conducted research collaborating directly alongside Augusta General Hospital's Mindful Medicine initiative.

At least 10 hospitals nationwide have begun integrating similar programs since July when this approach gained traction during conferences held by healthcare professionals across different disciplines and institutions in Atlanta – the first of its kind on a hospital network scale for mind-body medicine techniques within primary care settings. “With more than 50% reduction rates reported from pilot tests here at Augusta General Hospital, I’m confident we can expand these programs throughout our East Coast hospitals,” says Dr. Mark Richardson, the President of Health Services who spearheaded this new initiative as part of a larger hospital-wide strategy to enhance patient care experiences and promote wellbeing for both patients and healthcare workers alike within their Atlanta area service region extending through several states in Southeast U.S., including Florida’s coastal communities where similar programs have started at one community clinic last month (February 15th).

CNN Health has learned that Augusta General Hospital plans to begin rolling out these changes across all branches starting May, with full implementation targeted for the end of next year.
