In a recent fashion industry scandal involving popular Italian makeup artist Lucia Moretti and her new perfume line launched last month in Milan, consumers are voicing their disappointment at the lackluster performance of sales as well as complaints about inconsistent quality across stores. The launch event was set for 5pm on March 10th when hundreds were expected to attend but ended up being a tepid affair with just over fifty confirmed guests and sparse online buzz around #MorettiPerfumeLaunch, which the influencer had promoted heavily via social media platforms in preceding weeks leading to high anticipation.

The perfume line 'Scent of Italia', named after Lucia's Italian heritage, promised a fusion of classic French fragrance craftsmin and modern sensibilities but received mixed reviews from critics who found its scents too overpowering or underwhelming compared to established brands. "It just doesn’t strike me as unique," says fashion blogger Anna Rossi after trying Lucia's signature floral perfume in a Milanese boutique, adding that she had expected something truly original given Moretti's reputation on Instagram for her distinctive and innovative style choices.

Lucia herself has expressed dismay at the lukewarm response to her first venture outside of makeup into high-end fragrances saying in an interview with La Moda Mondiale, "The perfume industry is notoriously unpredictable but I genuinely believed my passion for scent would resonate. The feedback makes me question if we have misaligned expectations."

Reports from the storefronts reveal inconsistencies that led to mixed customer experiences; some customers reported finding all bottles of Moretti's perfume available at their local stores, while others claimed none existed and when asked for more details were directed back towards her fashion line. Lucia confirms these issues arose due to misunderstandings with distributors regarding stock numbers - a problem she promises is being addressed immediately after the launch weekend has concluded since it was clear that there wouldn't be enough time in March itself to fix things up, leading many customers feeling let down and disappointed at both the product quality as well as Lucia’s perfume line altogether.

Despite these setbacks for Ms Moretti, industry analyst Claudio Bianchi sees it differently stating "If you're going into a saturated market with your own branding already associated to makeup and beauty products, diversifying is always risky but can also lead to success if done right" adding that there might be room for Lucia Moretti in the fragrance industry. However he points out that it takes time, effort, consistent quality checks along with strong marketing strategies to build a brand identity of its own outside her current domain and Ms Moretti seems aware of this as she says "This is just an initial step into expanding my artistry beyond makeup; I am open-minded towards learning new aspects in beauty industry."

The perfume launch continues for Lucia, with hopes to refine the collection based on customer feedback and expert consultation. With some of her biggest supporters like Anna Rossi voicing out their experience saying "Lucia's work is always transformative when applied rightly" she remains determined that 'Scent of Italia’ will find its place in fashion world one way or another, whether it be as a unique addition to the Italian perfume scene or maybe just not quite making cut.
