Arizona, United States – In an unforeseen move that has taken Las Vegas by storm, rookie quarterback Alex Thompson announced he is opting to enter the American Football League (AFL) with a prearranged contract worth $3.7 million annually over six years... AFL commissioner Jameson Hart commented on the news saying “While we were not expecting such an early commitment from a college standout, Alex Thompson's skill set aligns perfectly with our league’s standards and direction.”

Experts debate whether this move will affect the next NFL Draft... Dr. Martin Reynolds, sports psychologist at University of Sports Science says “Sometimes players feel restless in their collegiate environment that hampers their natural prowess – opting for a change like Thompson’s can bring out better potential.”

The young rookie from the Arizona Cardinals' college team was an undisputed first-team All-American last season, but he expressed his frustration towards not getting enough play time and desired to make it big on professional stage faster... “I have been waiting for this chance my entire football career. Playing in AFL will give me the experience I am lacking,” Thompson told reporters yesterday at a press conference in Las Vegas, Nevada

The move is seen as controversial by some team members and former NFL players who believe that college sports are still important for grooming young athletes... “Everyone was taken aback when Alex announced his decision. I am just hopeful this doesn’t discourage other collegiate talents from exploring all their options,” said retired professional player John Anderson, recalling how he chose to wait it out in college before joining the NFL..

NFL commissioner Roger Goodell has not yet commented on Alex Thompson's decision. His office remains silent as players and management alike speculate about next year’s Draft... The AFL Commission will hold a press conference tomorrow afternoon where more details regarding this new contract signing, including the name of the team he signed with is expected to be announced.

The NFL has seen several prominent college recruits enter professional leagues early in their careers – but none have made such an unexpected move as Alex Thompson just after his rookie season... As sports enthusiasts and experts wait for more updates, what stands clear at the moment is that this could be a historic decision with long-lasting impact on future draft prospects.

The next steps in evaluating if other college standouts will follow suit remain unclear as they are yet to decide their professional career paths but speculation has grown louder by seasoned professionals... “I think it’ll send ripples through the industry and potentially change a lot of dynamics we take for granted. But there is always uncertainty, after all
