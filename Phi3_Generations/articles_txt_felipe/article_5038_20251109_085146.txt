A massive storm system battered eastern and northern parts of Australia last night, leading to widespselstormy damage across multiple states as heavy rains triggered floods in already saturated catchments areas. The extreme weather conditions began early yesterday morning before reaching peak intensity late that afternoon with the wettest regions recording upwards of 20 inches (51cm) precipitation within a few hours, according to meteorologists at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology.

Emergency services and local councils across Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria mobilized hundreds of personnel in response as rescuers assisted stranded residents amid swollen rivers overflowing banks with swift currents that claimed several motor vehicles already caught unawares by the deluge's ferocity. Residents expressed fear for their safety while pleading to remain indoors until authorities declared it safe again, especially those living in low-lying suburbs prone to flooding like Mission Beach and Broadbeach Waters near Brisbane where water levels reached nearly 10 feet above the usual sea marks.

Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk commented on social media urging her constituents: "Be safe, be strong," as she witnessed firsthand scenes of devastation from helicopters surveying affected areas along the state's coastline and hinterlands while aerial footage circulated globally within hours via internet platforms. New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian issued similar calls for vigilance to all Australians, noting that "the risk remains high in certain flood-affected regions."

Flooding has become an increasing concern across many parts of the continent due mainly because climate change is believed by experts like Professor Andrew Pitman from Sydney University's School of Biological Sciences:  "The frequency and intensity of these extreme weather events are consistent with predictions made some years ago as our planet continues to warm up."

In Victoria, residents along Gippsland Lake were urged to stay off the water after record-breaking rainfall led it levels rise dangerously close its banks. Heavy downpours continued intermittently throughout New South Wales and Queensland until sunset today as authorities maintained evacuation orders for several suburbs still inundated with floodwater, including Coffs Harbour's Lindeman Island where a small community huddled on higher ground amidst widespread property destruction.

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison expressed his condolences while acknowledging the need for recovery efforts: "We will support affected families and communities through this difficult time." Emergency management agencies are working round-the-clock distributing relief supplies, conducting inspections of structural damage to homes built on floodplains or near rivers which often experience seasonal high water levels during the wetter months. A joint statement by councils from three states called for continued patience as they navigate complex rescue operations amid heavy rainfall expected across affected areas until early next week before tapering off and giving way to a sunny outlook beyond that point according meteorologists' forecasts at this stage of the storm system.

"This was an incredibly challenging event," admitted Deputy Inspector General for Emergency Management Mike McGarvie, who deployed 20 aircraft overnight into today morning from Sydney International Airport and across state boundaries to assist ground operations amid floods affecting communities along New South Wales coastline as well inland towards Victoria which saw rivers
