A surprise midterm election campaign kickoff in a small Southern town has stirred excitement and curiosity among voters as they prepare for an unexpected turn of events on November 3rd, just one month away from Election Day. Residents of Greenwood have been buzzing with news that the mayoral candidate running against incumbent Mayor Thomas Reed is Governor-elect Lisa Martinez's cousin and former campaign manager Michael Greene—a move some say could reshape local politics dramatically if he wins a seat in Congress alongside his sibling.

In an unexpected twist on Monday, November 3rd will see both candidates representing the Green Party field their final touch-ups before hitting voters' minds hard during this month’s midterm elections—a day when more Americans decide to shape our political landscape than ever seen in recent history since records were first established.

“This election campaign has brought so much positive energy into our community, and I believe we can make significant changes that will benefit all of us,” said Michael Greene during his latest debate with Mayor Thomas Reed last Tuesday night at the Greenwood Community Center. 

According to CNN exit polls from previous years in similar towns throughout Alabama where both parties have run strong candidates, historically about half of voters stay home on Election Day but this time around an estimated turnout rate has already reached approximately 75%. This surge is credited largely to the fierce competition among top contenders and a hotly debated issue involving education reform.

"We are confident that our policies will help revitalize Greenwood," says Lisa Martinez, Greene's cousin who was elected governor this past November after serving as campaign manager for his brother in previous elections when he had run unsuccessfully against Thomas Reed back in 2decade ago. "Our family has always prioritized education and our plan includes increasing funding to local schools while providing more resources towards STEM programs."

Despite being a relative newcomer on the political scene, Michael Greene brings considerable experience as an assistant professor of Political Science at Auburn University who spent years researching governmental systems both domestically and abroad. He argues that his unique perspective will provide fresh ideas to Greenwood citizens frustrated with their current representatives: "I have firsthand knowledge from studying other places how different policies can solve local issues here in Alabama, and I believe this election is our chance for change."

The Greene siblings are not the only ones running against incumbent Reed. Businesswoman Emily Johnson—running as an independent candidate with endorsements including former Green Party leader Robert Simmons who has lived within minutes of here from time immemorial and served one term representing this very community before he ran unsuccessfully for mayor in 2015 against another relative, Reed’s cousin Jack Thompson. As both campaigns continue to gain momentum with Johnson hoping her business background can bring practical solutions while Michael Greene focuses on academia-based research as evidence of his policies' potential impact if elected into Congress alongside Lisa Martinez—who is also running for reelection this year in a different district but still plans working closely together once seated.

"We will be relentless about pushing our agenda forward while maintaining respectful dialogue with all parties involved," says Johnson at her campaign kickoff held last Friday afternoon where voters eagerly filled the Greenwood High School auditorium awaited an evening of candid conversation between candidates, town officials and citizens
