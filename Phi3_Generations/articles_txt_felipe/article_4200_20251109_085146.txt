In an unprecedented health scare across Chicago public schools this week, officials are investigating multiple reports of students exhibiting allergic reactions following lunches served in the cafeterias on Tuesday and Wednesday mornings. Reports indicate that as many as thirty children experienced symptoms ranging from hives to difficulty breathing after consuming certain items, leading health authorities at the Chicago Department of Health (CDH) to step in last Thursday with an immediate review.

"We've initiated a thorough investigation into potential allergens within our school meals," said Commissioner Dr. Elizabeth Johnson during her public address on Friday morning. "It is crucial for us to ensure the safety of every child."

The Chicago Department of Education (CDOE) has suspended service from certain suppliers, including Pillsbury Dough Company and FreshFarm Markets Inc., while CDH conducts a detailed analysis. School nutrition experts are examining meal preparation processes for potential oversight in food handling or cross-contambonation of allergenic ingredients such as nuts, dairy products, gluten, and shellfish—the most common triggers found to have caused previous outbreaks.

The school nurse at Westside Elementary confirmed seeing numerous students struggling with allergies since Tuesday morning's lunch service: "I had three kids in my office simultaneously that day," she shared candidly, expressing her worries about the recurring issue affecting a significant number of children within their educational institutions.

Parents and food safety experts have called for immediate actions to rectify these problems, with some urging tighter regulations on school lunch providers in Chicago's public education system: "It is absolutely imperative that we see sweeping changes here," commented local resident Mark Thompson after his son experienced an allergic episode last Tuesday.

As the investigation unfolds, CDH officials are urging parents to be vigilant when preparing lunches at home and keeping epinephrine auto-injectors accessible for those with known food sensitivities or life-threatening reactions: "In times like these," Dr. Johnson assured the public on Friday, "we must look out not just for ourselves but also our children."

CDH expects to release initial findings and any necessary recommendations from their review by next week as they work towards ensuring a safer environment within Chicago's school cafeterias.
