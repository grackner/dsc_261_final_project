A coordinated attack on two mosques in Iraq has left at least five people dead and ten injured across different cities within a span of hours today, local officials have confirmed. The assault began early this morning when gunmen opened fire inside the Al-Khadra Mosque located near Baghdad's Green Zone, as devout worshippers gathered for their Friday prayers at around 9am (local time). According to eyewittyes and local residents who were present during the attack, several armed individuals stormed in just before prayer began.

The horrifying incident took a turn when masked assailants emerged from nearby vehicles parked along Al-Mutanabbi Street carrying automatic rifles and grenades, launching an onslaught of gunfire inside the mosque's main courtyard as congregational prayers were being held. The crowd was in disarray when explosions rocked through the air within minutes after that initial exchange began; several worshippers described hearing shattering glass and metal grenades detonating nearby amidst pandemonic chaos.

Eyewitnesses told CNN affiliate WNN reported they heard screams for help as attackers shot indiscriminately outside the mosque, killing a woman in her 30s who was carrying groceries at that time and injuring several others near nearby Al-Tajer Square. The injured included three children among them all of whom were boys aged between eight to thirteen years old as well another young couple with their infant daughter also caught up amidst the fray after being separated from one another just moments beforehand when explosions rocked through Mosul's ancient city walls where they had sought refuge.

A security source confirmed that this was a coordinated attack, which targeted two mosques at once: Al-Khadra and Anbar Abu Omar Islamic Center situated approximately 8 miles apart within the same metropolitan area of western Baghdad but with one significant difference being their differing sectarian affiliations. The former Sunni facility suffered its share as well since gunmen fired towards Shiite worshippers leaving two dead and three wounded outside; whereas inside, fear gripped families due to continued shooting within building premises until law enforcement eventually quelled the attack after hours of chaos ensue when helicopters began descending upon insurgents who had taken refuge among nearby abandoned structures.

Iraqi authorities have labeled these horrific attacks as terrorism and are calling for a united response to confront this threat head-on; Prime Minister Adil Abd al Malik warned citizens that militant groups continue planning further strikes if vigorous action isn't taken immediately while urging national unity against sectarian divisions.

In an official statement, the Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Saeed Qomi reiterated these fears stating it is clear terrorists are exploiting religious differences to sow discord among Sunni and Shia Muslim communities throughout Iraq. He implored both sides to remain steadfast in faith while calling for all parties involved within society - political, social or otherwise-to reject violence as a means towards solving problems at hand:

"We must not allow fearmongering extremist ideologies divide our nation based on sectarianism; we ought instead focus upon upholding the true teachings of Islam which promotes unity amongst all humanity," said Qomi.
