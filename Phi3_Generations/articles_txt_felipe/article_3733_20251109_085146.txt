A beloved local baseball legend and community figure was found dead in his home early Friday morning, authorities announced yesterday amid a wave of shock and grief from fans and supporters alike. The late-night tragedy occurred on Thursday evening at the residence located off Main Street in Springfield's historic downtnerneighborhood.

The 72-year-old baseball player, Mike "Slugger" Rodriguez, was discovered by his wife and daughter when they arrived home after attending a charity game held last night at the city park next to their house. Official reports stated that Slugger died from an apparent heart attack.

"It's just unbelievable," said 45-year-old Springfield resident, Julie Rodriguez as she stood outside her brother and father’s home with tears streaming down her face. "He touched so many lives in the community — he was more than a baseball player; he brought our neighborhood together."

Mike “Slugger” had been known throughout his 30-year career, playing professionally for over two decades before retiring as one of America's most popular players. His impressive track record included five All-Star selections and a staggering lifetime batting average of .285 with hits in all nine seasons spent on the field between 1970 to 1999, according to sports records held by Springfield Public Library.

In addition to his accolades as an athlete, Slugger was active within community causes and charity work that he believed had a direct impact in helping those who struggled with financial hardships due to disability or illnesses — efforts which endeared him even further among local residents throughout the years.

"Mike made sure everyone knew about his foundation, but more importantly what it was doing for people here," said 53-year-old former high school baseball coach Robert Sullivan who played alongside Mike during their college days at Springfield University and credits Slugger with bringing a newfound sense of discipline to the field. "He always found ways to make us better, not just players but human beings."

Dr. Patricia Kimball from Good Hope Medical Center arrived on-scene around 2:30am yesterday after being called in by Springfield's Emergency Services Department for an autopsy of the former baseball player and a closer look at his health history over time — results are expected today (Friday).

“It’s hard to imagine that our community icon passed away so suddenly,” said Deputy Mayor Sarah Jenkins during yesterday afternoon news conference held downtown Springfield, adding “We share in the collective heartache of not only Mike's family and loved ones but also his many loyal fans who looked up to him.”

Slugger’s obituary notice appeared today on local newspapers across town: A Memorial service for "The Mayor of Slugman", as he was lovingly called, will be held at Springfield Central High School auditorium tomorrow evening (Friday) starting with a minute silence from 7pm to honor him before his eulogy and the announcement about donations being accepted.

“He did so much for this city — we owe it all,” said Jenkins, who adds that funds have already begun pouring in towards establishing scholarships by supporters within Springfield Baseball Alumni Association (SBAA) led initially by 62
