In an unexpected development that has shaken up college football rankings this weekend in Ann Arbor, Michigan, a major cheating scandal involving one of the nation's top-ranked teams unfolded as evidence mounted against players and coaches at Prestigious University. According to official statements released on Friday by NCAA investigators, practices such as performance enhancing substances have been used during games in an attempt to win crucial matches for national championships.

At least five key members of the team's defensive line were found with suspicious substances not cleared under medical supervision at a recent away game against Midwestern State University on Sunday, October 15th, officials said Thursday after an in-depth investigation spanned over four months since allegations first surfaced.

The discovery came as coaches and players faced increased scrutiny following the university's impressive win streak that led them to take top spot on several major polls nationwide – a feat now clouded by this scandal, which investigators claim was orchestrated at various levels of coaching staff from head football mentor Jason Smith down.

"Our primary concern has been maintaining the integrity and fairness in college sports for years," said Dr. Elizabeth Hayes, president of Prestigious University's Athletic Association. "We apologize to our fans, partners, alumni – everyone who had their trust misplaced by these actions."

Smith was not immediately available for comment; however university spokesman Mike Anderson commented on behthy condition Thursday evening saying he is aware of the allegations and they are taken very seriously. "We're conducting a full internal investigation, with NCAA oversight," he said in an emailed statement to reporters at Ann Arbor Media Networks offices where journalists from various national outlets were present during Thursday afternoon press conferences on the scandal breaking news story - including CNN.

"I will personally oversee every step of this investigation, and we won't stop until justice has been served," he added in an emotional video message broadcast by local stations WXYZ-TV (CNN) that morning where Anderson appeared alongside university president Dr Hayes during a press conference on the developing story.

The NCAA released documents obtained under Freedom of Information Act request which outlines allegations, testing results and suspension details for players involved in this scandal – including star running back Jason Williams who was found to have used performance-enhancing substances before each game against rivals Eastland University starting November 12th.

"This betrayal of trust is unbearable," Hayes told reporters as she broke down in tears during Friday's press conference at the athletic association headquarters where officials announced a stringent punishment for all players involved, alongside immediate suspension and probationary terms under NCAA rules. "I am deeply saddened that our beloved sport has been tarnished by this deceit."

CNN sports writer John Smith commented on what he believed to be the severity of Prestigious University's actions: "While it is true their win-at-any cost mentality was a double edge sword, they still maintained respectable records as well - which shows how difficult these decisions must have been for President Hayes."

In addition to suspending players from the 2019 season and all future games pending final NCAA review outcomes this coming Thursday afternoon where officials will officially release pun
