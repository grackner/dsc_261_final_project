Four years ago in Syria, a chemical attack unfolded as forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad unleashed deadly poison gas on civilian population of the city of Douma near Damascus. On April 7th of that year, reports surfaced from within and outside the war-torn country about scores being hospitalized with mysterious symptoms including skin lesions, bleeding nose or gums, respiratory issues, severe eye irritation among others - all signs pointing towards a possible chemical attack.

As CNN sources learned of an ongoing investigation by international organizations into the alleged use of chemical weapons in this conflict-ridden nation; it emerged that chlorine gas had been used as the primary agent to cause harm and sow fear amongst civilian populations, particularly those living near frontlines where government forces clashed with rebels seeking regime change.

In a statement obtained by our reporters, an official from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which is mandated to investigate any alleged use of chemical weapons under international law said: "While we are still investigating these claims thoroughly and conducting necessary on-site examinations at Douma. Our findings so far strongly suggest that chlorine gas has indeed been used in the region."

The UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres expressed his deep concern over reports about Syria's chemical attacks stating: "This is unacceptable and a flagrant violation of international law," He added. "It will not be tolerated by this United Nations or its member nations that are committed to upholding these laws."

The OPCW stated they had dispatched an expert team from their labs in The Hague who have arrived at Douma-Biqa airport, where they were met with opposition forces resistant to the UN monitors' presence. A local resident of one such camp told our reporters: "We are tired and scared; we can’t even breathe properly due to chlorine gas." The fear echoed by thousands more who continue their daily struggle for survival amidst escalating conflict in the region where government forces loyal to Bashar al-Assad fight rebels seeking regime change.

The UN has imposed several sanctions against Syria since early 2012 due to allegations of human rights violations including torture, enforced disappearances and arbitrary detention; however this recent development would mark the first time chemical weapons have been used in a way that directly targets civilians. As diplomats from various countries convene for an emergency meeting regarding potential international intervention on Syria’s situation - many world leaders are left with no choice but to consider more stringent measures against violators of human rights and war crimes; especially when faced with eyewit0 witness testimony such as that provided by our reporters.

What happens next will depend largely upon the outcome of international investigations into these alleged chemical attacks, which are expected to conclude within weeks at most but could extend up to months given complexities involved in conflict zones and security concerns affecting accessibility for investigators; alongside intense diplomatic discussions aimed towards finding a peaceful resolution that will hopefully bring an end to violence whilst ensuring accountability against any violations of international law committed by anyone.

The world continues to watch closely as this unfold, hoping justice may be served and lives spared in the pursuit for lasting stability within Sy
