A high-profile fashion week event in Milan last Thursday has taken a darker turn as allegations of unethical labor practices at one of its major design houses emerge. The annual Fashion Week Milano is set to be hosted by Gucci, but this year's show faces potential disruin due to concerns about working conditions within the company’s production facilities in Bangladesh.

The accusations surfaced last week after a series of worker testimonial interviews that brought forth stories suggesting long hours with insufficient breaks and paltry wages beneath industry standards, as reported by Reuters on Tuesday. These grievances are coming amid an international backlash against the fashion sector's labor practices which have increasingly been criticized for exploiting factory workers across Asia in recent years.

"We pride ourselves on innovation and style," said Giancarlo Giammetti, Chairman of Gucci during a press conference last Friday at Marriott Hotel Milan Sergianni Spa. "However, we also understand the importance of social responsibility." He went on to stress that they are investigating reports within their own facilities in Bangladesh and promising full transparency throughout this process.

Gucci has come under scrutiny before for its global supply chain's labor practices but Giammetti assured reporters the company is committed not only to style, innovation, quality of workmanship, sustainability, artistic vision and integrity in design – all hallmarks of fashion brands worldwide - "but also ethical treatment" towards its employees.

The workers at the Gucci-affiliated factory reported that their working hours exceeded 12 hours per day with few breaks over a three-week period, according to accounts given by current and former plant floor staff interviewed last week for this article as well others sourced from human rights organizations. Salaries were also notably low despite the high volume of output expected in Milan's fashion shows where Gucci will unveil its upcoming collection next month – estimated at US$10 million to $25 million per designer, with a total budget for this season reaching around 7 billion euros across all participating brands.

"When I heard about the reports of mistreatment and low pay on my first day working here five years ago, it felt like nothing changed," says Siti Aminah Rahmani, former seamstress who quit after witnessing these injustices unfolded over time while producing garments for Gucci fashion shows.

The revelations follow growing concerns from industry experts and watchdogs regarding labor exploitation within globalized supply chains that stretch across Asia to Europe as well - sparks of which can be traced back some way further than recent years' reports by the likes International Labor Organization (ILO). In fact, activists point out many companies continue employing sweatshops-like working conditions for decades if not centuries.

Meanwhile, Gucci has responded to growing calls from workers and human rights organizations urging them take immediate action - saying it's aware of "the importance" such issues have been raised over the past years while acknowledging they are currently undergoing a thorough investigation into allegations within their own factories in Bangladesh.

Sources close to fashion industry insiders tell CNN that multiple workers and NGO watchdogs alike expect Gucci – along with others at this year’s Milan Fashion Week - will likely be
