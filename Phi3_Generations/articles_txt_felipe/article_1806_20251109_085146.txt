In an unprecedented move within Hollywood circles, renowned director John Carter announced yesterday his intention to retire from filmmaking following a career spanning over three decthyrs of iconic films including "The Never-Ending Road" and the cult classic “Crimson Horizon”. Speaking at Los Angeles’ historic Grauman's Chinese Theater on Wednesday, 12th March, Carter stated with heavy emotion in his soft voice:

“It is an honor to announce my decision today. I have had a passion for storytelling since childhood and it has been incredible journey over the years sharing these stories through cinema.” The crowd erupted into applause as he concluded, acknowledging both gratitude and melancholy in his eyes: “This is not an easy goodbye to my craft. Yet I feel a sense of peace knowing that when you create something truly special - it endures beyond your own storytelling journey.”

Carter’s films have consistently attracted millions at the box office, with "The Never-Ending Road" grossing $200 million worldwide in its opening weekend alone. His retirement comes after a recent decline in audience interest due to shifting entertainment trends towards streaming services and social media content creators - platforms that provide immediate gratification but lack the depth of classic films which require longer viewings sessions for full appreciation, says film critic Emily Roberts from The Hollywood Gazette.

In his final interview with Vanity Fair magazine last night before taking to Twitter late in the evening where he shared few memories about past projects and colleagues alike without explicitly mentioning retirement but sparked rumors among followers who took it as a subtle hint at this historic announcement, Carter added: “I have cherished every moment spent working on these tales of love, loss, courage – our human stories which bind us all.”

Rumored since last month after multiple reports citing the director's age and physical strain from constant travel to global film sets in far-flung places like New Zealand for shooting "The Last Shore", this formal retirement comes as an end of days era where old Hollywood rules reigned supreme. Fans are expected now not just on social media but also through letter writing campaigns and possibly attending farewell screenings before their departure at 63 years old in Los Angeles – the city that gave birth to his career, he said: “I am grateful for my time here - both as a filmmaker and witnessing cinema’s evolution. There will always be room for love of this art form.”

Carter's team remains tight-lipped about details on future projects or collaborations with friends in the industry – perhaps indicating plans are being made to celebrate his legacy rather than continue pushing new footage forward, while fans and colleagues around him express deep appreciation. His children have voiced support for their father’s decision citing quality family time over extended movie sets as top reason: “It's important for John Carter that our entire family share these incredible years together at home,” said his daughter Sarah after the announcement, smiling through her tears while hugging him warmly. 

CNN Entertainment Correspondent Samantha Davis notes how unique this moment is in Hollywood’s history – a time when veteran directors are being celebrated for their entire careers rather than judged on recent box office success alone or new upcoming projects - which she describes as “unprecedented.” The director's
