"New Study Reveals Exerde's Innovative Approach to Combat Sedentary Lifestyles Amid Rising Health Concerns," reports by The Daily Mail on Tuesday evening shed light on an unconventional fitness program developed and piloted at the University of Fitville, located in Sunshine City.

In a bold move that's capturing national attention, Dr. Eliza Montgomery led 50 participants through her unique 'Active Sitting' regimen designed to reduce sedentary behavior while boosting overall health and fitness levels within urban communities facing increasing obesity rates. The study began in January at the university campus with plans for a six-month trial period, which has now been extended due to overwhelming success and demand from participants seeking lifestyle changes through this innovative approach.

Dr. Montgomery's program focuses on integrating light exercises into daily routines whereby individuals sit in specially designed ergonomic furniture that promotes movement, such as a stability ball or balance cushion under the buttocks and thigh muscles while performing tasks like reading emails at work desks. The goal is to engage core muscles subtly without requiring participants to leave their seats for traditional physical activities outside office hours.

"Sitting has been detrimental not just physically, but also mentally," Dr. Montgomery explains during an interview on WAVE Radio last Thursday morning at the university's health and fitness center. "Our bodies crave movement—our core muscles are designed to keep us upright constantly. Our program addresses this by seamlessly incorporating natural body movements into our daily lives."

Initial results of Dr. Montgomery’s trial reveal significant improvements in blood pressure, metabolic rates, and mental wellbeing among participants when compared with baseline measurements taken before the study began earlier this year at UFIT (University Fitness Institute). The university's fitness experts observed a 12% decrease on average across all metrics after three months of 'Active Sitting,' inspiring confidence to extend and expand upon these findings.

"Seeing such promising results has encouraged us," commented the Dean of UFIT, Prof. Leonard Hastings during an appearance at Sunshine City Council meeting last Friday night discussing funding for further research on this innovative program modelled after a successful pilot phase conducted in January within our campus walls here today—24 February 2023. "It's incredible to think that simple modifications like active sitting could potentially transform office culture and impact public health positively."

Healthcare professionals nationwide are lauding the groundbreaking findings, with cardiologists noticing a marked decrease in stress levels among patients who have incorporated 'Active Sitting' into their routines. Experts believe that reducing prolonged periods of sitting could prove crucial for tackling sedentary-related health issues faced by modern society including heart disease and diabetes.

As the public shows immense interest, questions arise on how to make this concept accessible beyond academia walls where such exercises can easily be implemented into daily life—a challenge that both UFIT's Dr. Montgomery and Sunshine City Council hope will drive further discussions among health experts across industries about adopting a more active lifestyle at workp0ffices globally as they consider next
