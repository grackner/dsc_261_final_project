On Thursday evening in Chicago, a group of tech entrepreneurs gathered at 'Sky High Innovations', an upscde Lakeside conference center to announce the launch of their newest artificial intelligence platform that promises revolutionize personal finance management for consumers. The event featured keynote speeches from top industry leaders including CEO Jane Smith, who unveiled her company's innovative AI-driven app called 'FinSmart'. 

"In an age where financial decisions impact our future significantly," said Ms. Smith during the press conference held at Sky High Innovations near Lake Michigan on Thursday evening local time, "we believe that it is essential for consumers to have a robust tool in their arsenal."

The new app offers features like real-time budget tracking and predictive financial advice tailored specifically to user behavior patterns. It has been developed by 'SmartAI Ventures', led by Ms. Smith who, alongside CTO Robert Lee and Chief Financial Officer Sarah Johnson, spent the past two years refining their proprietary algorithms based on consumer psychology and big data analysis techniques.

A representative from SmartAI Ventures stated that more than 10,000 pre-registrations have been received since they launched a beta version of 'FinSmart' last month to select users across the Midwest region for testing feedback before its wider release later this year in Chicago and then nationwide.

The market potential is significant as data from financial consulting firms like McKinsey & Company estimates that personal finance management tools accounted for a $13 billion industry by 2018, which grew to over $45 billion two years later with the continued digital transformation of services and products. Industry experts speculate this trend will continue growing rapidly due in part to generational shifts where millennials are increasingly seeking out personalized financial guidance through technological means as well as a general desire for convenience amidst an evolving economy post-pandemic, according to the Chicago Financial Analyst Group.

Senior Economist at CFAG Dr. Emily Chen commented on how "the demand is there because consumers are looking not only towards saving but smart investment as well." With a rapidly expanding global market in fintech and AI, many industry analysts predict SmartAI Ventures will be one of the next notable entries to hit headlines within its sector.

Mary Thompson, an early pre-registrant who has been using 'FinSmart' for several weeks now shared her experience with CNN Money reporter Alex Gordon stating that "the interface is user-friendly and it actually feels like I have a friend overseeing my financial health." The app already boasts features such as AI personalized investment suggestions, automated expense categorization based on individual spending habits, and custom savings goals for major life events.

Smooth integration into current digital ecosystems allows consumers to synchronize 'FinSmart' with their existing bank accounts seamlessly – ensuring privacy through advanced encryption protocols while simultaneously providing real-time insights on spending habits and offering proactive saving suggestions based on predicted market trends, as stated in a testimonial by an early beta user.

The launch has already drawn attention from major investment banks who have expressed interest after seeing the preliminary results of 'FinSmart'. A representative from Morgan Stanley commented that this could
