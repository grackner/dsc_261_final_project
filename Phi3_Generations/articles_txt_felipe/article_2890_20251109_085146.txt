"Researchers in New York City make breakthrough on treatment for a rare genetic disorder affecting children under five years old."

Experts at Mount Sinai Hospital are celebrating what could be one of the most significant medical advances made in recent times – right here in our own backyard. A team led by Dr. Sarah Thompson has successfully treated two young patients suffering from a rare genetic disorder known as X-linked Ichthyosis (XLI) through gene therapy, which typically results in severe skin conditions for the afflicted children and can lead to life-thnerving complications if left untreated.

The breakthrough took place on Tuesday when 40 month-old Isabella Garcia was wheeled into the pediatric wing at Mount Sinai, accompanied by her mother Maria Rodriguez with a hope that this novel treatment might offer some relief to their daughter's persistent and worsening skin condition. After just four rounds of gene therapy using custom-designed adeno-associated viruses (AAV), both Isabella and 43-month-old Alex Hernandez, who was similarly diagnosed at age two with severe XLI symptoms about six months ago now show marked improvements in skin health.

Dr. Thompson said this could be a major step toward finding an effective treatment for the devastating condition that has only had palliative care options available to date: "For years, our team have struggled against odds trying different therapeutic approaches - and finally today we've been able to bring tangible relief."

"The improvement in their conditions after just a month of treatment is extraordinary," says Dr. Henry Foster from the National Institutes of Health who was not involved with this research but praised its potential impact on global medical practice, saying that "this trial could provide new hope for thousands around the world suffering from genetic disorders."

Researchers are cautious to note more work remains before they're able draw firm conclusions about long-term efficacy and safety of gene therapy as a primary treatment modality. But if results continue at this pace, it could represent nothing short than 'medical miracles', according to Dr. Thompson: "If the children maintain their progress for years like we see today - that's an exciting prospect."

Experts warn gene therapies are still very much in experimental stages and a long way from being widely available treatments; but parents, nonetheless hopeful about these promising results. Rodriguez shared how the breakthrough has brought back something to her family they thought was lost forever: "We didn't want to get our hopes up - not any more than we already had - but today is a beautiful day for us because Isabella looks and feels like she used to be."

In this case, hope seems warranted – at least in the eyes of these two young patients.
