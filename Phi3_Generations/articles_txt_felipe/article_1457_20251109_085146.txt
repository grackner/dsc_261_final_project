E-commerce giant Amazon has announced plans to launch a new streaming service aimed at its massive user base within the next year. The Seattle-based company's entertainment division CEO revealed in an interview with Business Insider that they have partnered with leading film studios and rights holders, ensuring exclusive content for their subscribers from day one.

Amazon already boasts a vast selection of movies and TV shows through its Prime Video service but this new venture promises to take Amazon's media offerings into uncharted territory as it attempts to become the next Netflix in entertainment dominance. In an exclusive interview, CEO Andy Jassy said that their goal is not just expansion for growth sake; they are seeking a genuine connection with customers by providing high-quality and curated content choices from top directors like Christopher Nolan and Taika Waititi among others who bring diverse storytelling to the table.

"We've always believed in delivering something unique, that sets us apart," Jassy explained during a press conference at their headquarters last Thursday. "When it comes down to streaming services these days, everyone seems content with replicating what others have done before and we don't want our subscribers settling for mediocrity."

Citing figures from recent industry reports published by PwC on Friday evening, Amazon has revealed that more than half of U.S consumers now watch movies or TV shows online rather through cable television services alone – a number which continues to grow steadily each year as streaming content becomes the preferred option for entertainment consumption amongst younger audiences in particular demographics such as millennials and Gen Z's who value on-demand accessibility of media over traditional methods. 

With competition heating up among tech giants like Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max to name a few; Amazon plans not only expand their content library but also enhancing personalization techniques using artificial intelligence which will learn viewer's preferences through viewing habits for more accurate recommendations in the future.

Jassy highlighted that this is part of what makes them stand out: "Customers deserve to experience entertainment tailored just for them, with something fresh and engaging every time they open their eyes." The company's move into media may also pave way for Amazon Prime memberships to include access not only discount prices on products but now immersive virtual reality experiences alongside the upcoming streaming service.

Experts across industries are watching closely, anticipating potential shifts in how businesses will operate within digital spaces and respond accordingly while consumer watchdogs voice concerns about data privacy amidst personalized content curation that utilizes extensive customer profiles for tailored suggestions. 

Jessica Simpson recently tweeted her excitement at the prospect of Amazon’s expansion: "I can't wait to see what amazing shows and movies will come out from @amazonprime! This is big news!" Meanwhile, movie director Steven Spielberg commented on a call that he feels proud as his works are part of this innovative venture but added caution about quality assurance during mass-produced content: "While I'm thrilled my work could reach audiens in new ways through Amazon Prime’s streaming service, ensuring top-notch production standards remains crucial."

Looking forward towards next steps, Jassy assured that they are focused on delivering excellence to their subscribers: "We
