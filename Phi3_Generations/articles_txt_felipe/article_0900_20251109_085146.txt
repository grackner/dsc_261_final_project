In a groundbreinovative study published this week in The New England Journal of Medicine, scientists from Johns Hopkins University have developed a new gene therapy that has shown promising results in early-stage clinical trials for treating cystic fibrosis. This first step forward comes after decades of research and could represent hope for thousands suffering worldwide with the genetic disorder, which is most common among Caucasians living in developed countries such as the United States.

The study involved 30 participants who received a one-time infusion into their lungs to deliver healthy copies of the CFTR gene directly to lung cells where they are needed for proper functioning and repair, according to Dr. Laura Hayden, lead researcher on this project at Johns Hopkins Medicine Center in Baltimore.

"This is an incredibly exciting time," says Dr. Hayden. "For so long people living with cystic fibrosis have felt trapped by their disease and unable to imagine anything but the worst outcome for themselves." She adds, however, that this therapy requires further testing before it can become a standard treatment option; one of its most notable effects is an improved lung function.

The 30-person clinical trial was conducted at Johns Hopkins Medicine Center on April 15th as part of the Phase I study for gene therapy aimed specifically toward those with cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder characterized by progressive damage to various organs and typically resulting in death from complications such as lung failure or severe respiratory illness before age 30.

"The average life expectancy for people living with this disease is around the mid-twenties," says Dr. Michael Stiefel, director of Cystic Fibrosis Medicine at Boston Children's Hospital and an expert in gene therapies who was not involved in this research project but praises its potential impact on future treatments for CF patients across the globe. "The fact that we can see even a glimpse into what life could be like with better health outcomes is so important."

Cystic fibrosis primarily affects Caucasians born in developed countries, and about 70% of individuals with this disorder have been found to carry the faulty gene within their family lineage. Current treatments focus on alleviating symptoms rather than addressing underlying genetic abnormalities that cause mucus buildup throughout organs including lungs; an estimated one in every 30 Americans carries at least one copy of this mutated CFTR gene responsible for the disorder, as well.

Participants were carefully selected based on their medical histories and current health statuses while taking part during a period from February to April where no treatments other than standard care have been administered prior; all agreed with informed consent that they understand potential risks inherent in gene therapy research, including unknown long-term consequences.

"Our hope is for this treatment option will continue through clinical trials leading towards regulatory approval from the FDA and subsequently widespread availability," says Dr. Hayden while noting that she remains cautiously optimistic about its impact on her patients' quality of life moving forward despite promising results thus far as only a fractional percentage have seen significant improvements in lung function since beginning treatment two months ago today (April 15th).
