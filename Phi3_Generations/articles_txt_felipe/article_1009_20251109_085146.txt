Topic: World - India

In a stunning revelation that has taken center stage in New Delhi this Tuesday evening, intelligence reports from within Indian borders have unveiled what appears to be the world's most sophisticated and covert bioweapon program targeting human DNA manipulation. The operation reportedly commenced over a decade ago at undisclosed locations across India with an estimated budget of 50 billion rupees ($683 million).


The alleged project, dubbed 'NeuroSculpt' by whistleblowers within the program, is said to be aiming for enhancements and augmentations in human cognitive abilities through direct neural tissue alteration. This chilling disclosure comes after several decades of heavy investments into conventional military research with a focus on defense rather than such radical bioethical issues.


A senior official at the Ministry of Science and Technology, who requested anonymity due to safety concerns about his position's security, provided some insight: "While we cannot confirm or deny these allegations directly because they are unauthenticated claims within India, it is essential for us as a nation that such rumors do not spread unchecked. Our research ethics committees and bio-security protocols remain rigorous."


Experts on biological warfare in the country emphasize further investigation to dispel these concerns or confirm them: "Given India's robust track record for science, such a program could potentially raise both national pride as well as ethical red flags. The scientific community is closely monitoring any developments and will be ready with countermeasures if necessary."


Local witnesses express disbelief at the rumors of bioweaponization: "This just can't possibly be true, right? I mean we are all proud Indians but such thoughts never crossed my mind. It sounds like something from a sci-fi film!" 


The revelation is expected to trigger immediate inquiries by global powers and organizations concerned with biosecurity standards – raising alarms about the need for international dialogue on research ethics within science.
