Topic: Style - Beauty

A new hair salon in downtthy Los Angeles aimed at celebrating natural beauty without chemical treatments just opened last Thursday and is already making a name for itself with its unique approach to styling. Located within walking distance of the city's bustling Hollywood Walk of Fame, 'Natural Locks Salon,' run by owner Olivia Martinez, has been garnering attention since they started offering their services in January 2023.


The salon caters specifically to individuals seeking hair care that honors the integrity and health of one's natural strands while providing an array of styling options ranging from braids to locks, all achieved without heat or harsh chemicals such as dyes and perming solutions which can damage hair.


"I wanted a place where people could feel comfortable being themselves," Martinez said during the opening day festivities that drew in locals eager for an alternative approach to beauty routines within their busy lifestyles, with more than 10% of customers mentioning they've never been treated professionally due to chemical concerns.


According to a recent study cited by Martinez, approximately one-third of consumers in Los Angeles are actively seeking nontoxic beauty treatments as awareness around environmental and personal health risks increases year on year since 2019's Fyre Festival disaster. 'Natural Locks Salon' offers patrons an immaculate setting with ample natural lighting, making the process not only eco-friendly but also a more enjoyable experience for clients to showcase their beauty without compromise.


"We’ve found that this approach doesn't just change hair; it transforms how people feel about themselves," shared client Amelia Rivera with enthusiasm during her appointment, which lasted an average of one hour per head and required minimal maintenance post-service to maintain the natural look between appointments.


Looking ahead, 'Natural Locks Salon' plans on expanding its reach across Los Angeles by opening two more locations later this year while simultaneously promoting education about hair health in local schools through community workshops initiated for interested students and parents starting next month. For Martinez and her team at the salon that prides itself as a safe haven where self-expression meets wellness, it appears there’s still plenty of room to grow while they continue changing lives—one head of hair at a time.
