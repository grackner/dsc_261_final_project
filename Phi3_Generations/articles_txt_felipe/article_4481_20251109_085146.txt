Megan Fox has confirmed her role in a new science fiction film set to release on April 15th next year at Universal Studios Florida. The Hollywood star will be seen reprising her character from the franchise’s first installment, with director Jordan Poumelle promising an "unforgettable cinematic experience" for fans of classic sci-fi adventures.

Megan Fox has been in talks since last August to return as Samanthin McTavish, a role she played during her early days in film before achieving international stardom with movies like 'Transformers' and box office hits such as 'Jennifer's Body'. In an exclusive interview on E! Entertainment Television yesterday, Fox revealed that the project is titled 'Starship Sam', and boasts a screenplay by best-selling author Tim Sullivan.

"It has been almost three years in development since we first met with Jordan Poumelle," said Megan during their conversation about her upcoming film on set at Universal Studios Florida, which she confirmed would launch next year to rave reviews and critical acclaim from fans of the genre who have long-awaited for such a sequel. "I feel incredibly blessed that I will get another chance to work with [Poumelle] again as we continue our journey through space."

The film, which is set in an alternative future where humanity has mastered interstellar travel but struggles with sustaining life on distant planets. Fox’s character finds herself embroiled among alien factions fighting for control of resources and territory across the galaxy when she discovers a hidden truth about her people's past, thrusting them into an epic battle between science fiction fantasy elements—good vs. evil clichés are deftly sidestepped in this gritty space opera that takes viewers on heart-pounding adventures through the cosmos with its stellar special effects and sound design crafted by industry veteran Jake Carter (‘Blade Runner 2049’).

"Starship Sam is not your typical sci-fi story," said Poumelle, who has collaborated on multiple blockbuster films throughout his career. "Megan brings an incredible sense of depth and nuance to her character that shatters conventional genre tropes." His next project—a biopic about legendary jazz singer Ella Fitzgerald set for release in 2024 at MGM Studios Los Angeles Center starring Cynthia Erivant, will also star Megan Fox as the woman behind her famous husband's music.

As fans eagerly anticipate this much-anticipated sequel alongside a critically acclaimed upcoming biopic on jazz legend Ella Fitzgerald and other projects in development for various studios worldwide; it is clear that Megan Fox remains one of Hollywood’s most sought-after actresses.

"Meg has always been the kind of artist who doesn't take herself too seriously," said director Tim Sullivan, an Oscar winner himself on his latest screenplay project titled 'Starship Sam', which premiered at a film festival last month receiving rave reviews from critics and audiences alike. "I wanted to create something that would showcase her range as she brings life back into the universe."

Next steps for Megan include promotional events leading up to the release, with fan meet-ups in Los Angeles set by Universal Studios Entertainment scheduled throughout
