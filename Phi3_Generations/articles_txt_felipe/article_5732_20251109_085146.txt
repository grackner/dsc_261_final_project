A recent health study conducted by researchers at Springfield University in Missouri has brought new attention to local fitness facilities and their impact on community well-betermomics across the Midwest region. The comprehensive survey, which took place between March and June of this year with over a thousand respondents participating from cities such as St. Louis, Kansas City, and Columbia (the latter being Springfield's home base), aimed to measure changes in physical activity levels pre-pandemic versus the last two years since gym closures became widespread during COVID-19 lockdown periods.

The findings revealed a significant shift with 70% of participants reporting they had become more active, while only 25% expressed feeling less fit or healthier despite being unable to visit their usual workout spots regularly. Notably, the study underscored how outdoor activities like jogging and cycling saw an uptick in popularity as people searched for alternative ways to maintain physical activity amidst stringent restrictions that prevented access to indoor gyms or fitness centers nationwide until recently when many states began easing health orders.

"We've seen a real change, but it seems like this momentum could be harnessed if people continue taking charge of their own physical well-being," says Dr. Emily Stanton, lead researcher and an advocate for community fitness initiatives based at Springfield University’s Center for Health Research (CHR).

Fitness instructor Mark Benson from the nearby city gym expressed hopeful optimism as state health officials are gradually easing restrictions: "It's fantastic to see people embracing a more active lifestyle, and we at Springfield Fitness Center can only grow in popularity. We welcome everyone back with open arms once it’s safe."

Municipal leaders have expressed cautious optimism about the city revitalizing its local economy as gym-goers start trickling into reopened facilities, providing a boost to businesses and employment rates within these industries. The Springfield City Council is exploring ways of promoting outdoor fitness spaces like parks while ensuring public safety protocols are in place - with Mayor Linda Thomas commenting: "Our priority will be the health and well-being of our citizens, who have proven that staying active doesn't require a fancy gym membership or expensive equipment. We want to ensure everyone has access."

As for what lies ahead, CHR researchers are planning longitudinal studies examining whether these heightened levels of activity will become the new norm and how fitness facilities can better serve their communities moving forward – with Dr. Stanton commenting: "This change in attitude towards physical health is fantastic news - we just need to find ways that people can continue engaging in meaningful, sustained exercise habits into the future."
