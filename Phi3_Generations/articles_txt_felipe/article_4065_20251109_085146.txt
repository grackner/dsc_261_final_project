A beloved local figure skater made headlines when she took a dramatic turn in her career path following an accident at last month's city-sponsored hockey tournament held on February 18th at the Thompson Arena, located just outside of Springfield. Ella Martinson, once revered for her impeccable pirouettes and precise spins on ice skates since she was a toddler at Lakeview Sports Club in Green Meadows neighborhood, faced an unexpected challenge that led her towards soccer rather than continuing with figure skating competitdependent.

Martinson's journey took an unforeseen twist during the regional junior hockey tournament when another player accidentally tripped over Martinson while making a move on ice and caused her to lose balance, resulting in sprained ankle that required surgery. "I can still feel it sometimes; I never expected my passion for sports would lead me here," said Ella with evident emotion as she recounted the incident at her current rehab facility where specialists are working hard on regaining full mobility of her foot and leg, which have been significantly affected by the injury.

Her coach, Jack Roberts, reflected during an interview that while he is saddened to see Ella take a different route in sports than they had hoped for initially: "Ella has always shown us time after time how passionate she was about skating and hockey; her love for sports runs deep. And if this accident helps her find another athletic outlet with as much zeal, I couldn't be prouder of my student." 

Dr. Lisa Henderson, the lead orthopedic surgeon who performed Ella's operation explained that while a full recovery is possible after surgery and rigorous physiotherapy, Martinson might need to find sports with less reliance on fine-tuned footwork because of her ankle instability. "It will be crucial for Ella to understand the limitations she must abide by in order not to re-injure herself," said Dr. Henderson during a recent examination at St. Joseph's Medical Center where Martinson continues her recovery journey.

Sports psychologists like Sarah Gomez are working with athletes including Ella, helping them cope mentally and emotionally through injuries: "Transitioning to different sports can be tough for any athlete; however, the right support system is essential in these situations," said Ms. Gomez while discussing her current therapy sessions with Martinson who has been attending daily sport psychology consultations at Springfield University's Counseling Center since late February 2018 to help deal with both physical and emotional aspects of the injury, as well as readjustment into other athletic activities.

Ella is currently taking on soccer practice thrice a week under strict supervision from her coaches at Central High School in Green Meadows where they have modified several rules allowing Ella to play without fearing immediate re-injury, while also working closely with sports psychologists and physiotherapists.

As Martinson continues on this unexpected but promising path towards soccer recovery post her figure skating days due in June 2019, the local community has rallied behind their talented young athlete to wish for a speedy comeback of not just an individual player, but also as symbolic hope that sports injuries could pave way for new beginnings and
