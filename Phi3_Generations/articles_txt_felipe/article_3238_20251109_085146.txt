A sudden influx of tourists to Hawaii has overwhelmed local lodgings as visitors flock in for a once-a-decade celebration event set to take place this summer across the Aloha State, CNN reports Tuesday (May 31). The annual "Hawai'i Decade Fest" is expected to draw more than half a million people from all around the world.

The festivities include numerous cultural performances, parades, and beach clean-ups scheduled over ten days starting June 2nd until June 14th in cities across Hawaii including Honolulu, Maui, O'ahu, Kaua'i, Molokai, Lana'i, and finally back to Honolulu.

However, the anticipated celebrations are causing a significant strain on accommodation availability as hotel prices have skyrocketed with some rooms costing upwards of $200 per night in places like Waikiki Beach during peak times – an amount not usually seen for weekend trips to Hawaii.

"I can't believe how crazy this year has gotten," said Janet Lopez, who booked a suite at the iconic Royal Hawaiian Hotel three months ago when she first heard about the event through social media channels. "We were planning on taking our kids to celebrate their graduation from high school as well - it was supposed to be special for us too."

"The prices have definitely increased since we booked," Lopez added, noting that her estimated cost per night has gone up by at least $50. "We're hoping a spot will open last minute and let our family stay together because they are part of the reason why this is happening in the first place."

Experts have been monitoring hotel rates closely with mixed feelings as local businesses prepare for an influx expected to be their largest event-related revenue source since 2018 when Hawaii was rocked by a tropical storm. A representative of VisitHawaii, the state's official tourism board shared some insights: "Our goal is always sustainable growth in visitor arrivals and spending over time - this year we have seen an unprecedent surge that will provide economic benefits but also challenges for our industry."

Tour operators told CNN Local hoteliers are working hard to accommodate guests with added services like extra staffing, upgraded rooms or even partnerships with nearby resorts offering special rates. Despite their best efforts and loyalty programs aimed at encouraging repeat business from local visitors during future events that will also be celebrated across the Aloha State next year - many are feeling uneasy about overcrowding affecting personal experiences on island paradise holidays they planned for years, hoping it won't last.

Maria Chang of Maui said: "I understand why prices went up but I wish people could enjoy our beautiful beaches without all the commotion." Tourism officials emphasized that hotels and other businesses are trying their best to manage large crowds responsibly while providing a great vacation experience. Officials urged tourists not only respect local culture and traditions, environmentally friendly practices but also show understanding towards staff who often work tirelessly during the festive period with extra hours in busy establishments like Wailea Beach Resort where guests have noticed larger than usual service teams on duty every day they visit.
