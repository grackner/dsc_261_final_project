A mysterious fog has enveloped parts of Beijing overnight, leading to a series of unexplained sightings and disrufort among residents on this Thursday evening (June 10th), CNN reports. The eerie mist rolled into the city at approximately 7:00 PM local time last night as temperatures dipped below freezing after an abrupt thaw earlier in the week, with many suggesting that it may be a rare meteorological occurrence or even something more supernatural happening deep within China's capital.

Eyewitnesses say they initially thought to joke about seeing ghosts due to this strange phenomenon; however, as confusion spread through social media and news outlets across the nation, residents demanded answers from local authorities who have issued statements saying there is no imminent danger but also refusing any speculation regarding supernatural causes. "The unusual weather patterns we're experiencing are a cause for further investigation by our meteorological department," said an official spokesperson to CNN reporters on the scene, standing atop one of Beijing’s oldest buildings with sweaters wrapped around their necks and coffee thermos in hand.

Becoming increasingly concerned about how long this fog will linger throughout the city streets that have been eerily quieted down by thick clouds rolling through unseen corners since early evening hours, many locals took to expressing both fears for what lies within those mists as well frustrations over lack of information from local officials.

"I've lived here my whole life and this is the first time I ever remember anything like it," shared a 62-year-old retired taxi driver in Tiananmen Square who was waiting for loved ones to arrive before deciding whether or not he would brave going back home with his wife later on that evening.

Experts believe this abnormal weather may be related to shifting patterns from recent years due to climate change; however, more studies and research are required according Dr. Zhang Wei of Beijing's National University’s Meteorology Center: "We need to look at the data thoroughly before we can confirm anything about these fog occurrences."

As night descends upon residents still wondering what lies within those mists - a new winter chill setting in or something unearthly? Official statements assure people they will not be alone as search parties composed of Beijing’s emergency services along with local university experts are conducting investigations at all hours across the capital.

"The situation is under control," said an official addressing reporters outside City Hall later in the evening after tour groups arrived on their buses to see firsthand what they had heard and read about during daylight, leaving mixed emotions throughout Beijing's residents amid confusion of whether or not this will ever end. "We are doing everything possible here."

While many continue sharing stories with strangers at local cafés in hopes that someone might shed some light on the situation for others across town as well; one thing is certain - no Beijinger wants to find themselves trapped within these unsettling mists ever again.
