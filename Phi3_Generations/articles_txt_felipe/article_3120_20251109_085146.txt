A massive art heist at a London gallery last night has left authorities and patrons shocked as dozens of valuable paintings have disappeared without trace or sign of forced entry. The National Gallery in Trafalgar Square reported the crime around midnight, with over $2 million worth of Renaissance masterpieces vanishing into thin air.

Investigators are baffled by how a team managed to execute such an elaborate plan so quickly and quietly; no alarms were triggered during the heist, which unfolded amidst one of London's busiest thoroughfares known for its tourists at nightfall time-wise on Tuesday.

"The lack of evidence suggests that this could be a highly skilled group with inside knowledge," said Chief Inspector Jane Thompson from Scotland Yard who led the initial investigation team to the scene where three security guards found an empty wall and confused art aficionados wandering in after their night's work.

One witness, 35-year-dealer Sophie Martinez observed a figure cloaked by shadows nearing one of the Renaissance masterpieces just before midnight: "I saw someone suspiciously hover around 'The Birth of Venus.' I thought they were admiring it as much as we all did, but something about their movements felt off."

Increasing tensions are rising among London's elite and art circles following the brazen heist. With a significant part of its collection featuring work from artists like Titian or Botticelli that attract millions to visit annually; it has become an economic pillar for British culture, says cultural attache Richard Davies: "Not only are these pieces irreplaceable historically and artistically but they're the lifeblood of our nation’s artistic heritage."

Experts weigh in on how such a high-profile case might unfold. Art historian Dr. Henry Clarke suggests, “It is quite an impressive operation that has left many baffled.” He adds to BBC News Online's article: "This sort of crime often leaves behind some form of signature or calling card – something that can provide crucial clues for detectives."

As the investigation continues into this sensational art heist, officials are urging visitors and residents alike not to touch anything outside their comfort zone until further notice. With a team from Interpol dispatched immediately after authorities reported the crime; efforts remain focused on finding leads that could lead investigators towards possible suspects or motives behind what can only be described as modern-day art thievery in Britain's capital city—an event which now sits atop London’s notoriety for eccentric crimes.
