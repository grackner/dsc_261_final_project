In a historic move for Asian politics, peace talks have begun between North and South Korea on May 27th in the neutral city of Panmunjom under close surveillent from international watchdogs such as China and Russia. The meeting comes after decades-long conflict that has plagued not only these two nations but also their surrounding regions, including Japan, which stood by anxiously over recent months' tense developments on the Korean peninsula.

South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in opened yesterday morning with a powerful message: "These talks could change our world." North Korean Chairman Kim Yong-chol echoed similar sentiments during his statement, emphasizing that they are seeking dialogue for lasting peace and prosperity.

The negotiations will focus on issues such as nuclear disarmament, the demilitarization of South Korea's border region with North Korea, easing tensions between both countries’ people via cultural exchanges while addressing human rights concerns within North Korea itself - a hot-button issue which has garnered international attention.

"We have never met before, but this is an opportunity for dialogue that the world needs," South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung Hwa told reporters in Seoul today after arriving from Pyongyang with Kim Yong Chol's envoy on board their aircraft carrying gifts between themselves as part of goodwill gestures ahead to discussions.

The talks are being held amidst a backdrop that includes the escalating nuclear threat posed by North Korea, China’s firm stance against any resolution involving its ally and Russia's ambiguous position so far; experts believe these dynamics will heavily influence negotiations outcomes going forward. 

"It remains to be seen how much leverage each party has in shaping this dialogue," said Professor James Lee, an expert on Korean affairs at Tokyo University who was not involved with the talks directly but spoke about them closely through press conferences and briefings throughout recent months' developments before finally speaking privately today after listening to several rounds of direct speeches between both sides.

According to reports from Pyongyang last week, Kim Yong-chol had offered a list of demands during his private meeting with Moon Jae-in - among them the easing of sanctions imposed by countries such as China and Russia on North Korea's leadership while ensuring progress toward complete disarmament. South Korean officials initially rejected these terms citing concerns about their own national security interests but are now reportedly reconsidering following new intelligence indicating Pyongyang may be more willing to compromise than previously thought given recent internal struggles within its inner circle led by young and aggressive leader Kim Jong-un.

An unidentified source familiar with the discussions inside Panmunjom told CNN earlier today that North Korea is not expected at this point in time offer significant concessions but rather hopes to use dialogue as leverage towards maintaining current policies while gradually easing sanctions against them by nations such as China and Russia, who have been vocal about wanting talks resumed sooner than later after the stalemate that occurred during Kim Jong-un's last meeting with Moon back in March 2017.

CNN reached out to multiple South Korean officials today for comment on this report but did not hear back immediately; other countries, including Japan and China have also signaled their supportive attitude towards these talks which
