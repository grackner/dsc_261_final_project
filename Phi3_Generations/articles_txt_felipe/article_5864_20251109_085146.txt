Museum of Modern Art in New York City Announces Iconic Piece 'Starry Night' for Restoration

NEW YORK - The Museum of Modern Art announced today that its prized possession "Starry Night" by Vincent van Gogh, which had been on display since April is now undergoing a meticulous restoration process. This timeless masterpiece will return to view sometime next year after the delicate work has concluded.

Restoration experts have estimated that they need approximately 8 months for "Starry Night," and plans are already in place at MoMA's conservation studio where each brushstroke is being carefully cleaned, repainéd as necessary, all while ensuring minimal impact on the original artwork itself. The museum spokeswoman shared her insights with CNN:

"It’s a delicate balance of honoring van Gogh's technique and using modern restoration methods to preserve his masterpiece for future generations." 

A team consisting mainly of Van Gogh scholars, curators, art historians, and skilled conservators from MoMA will be leading the project. "The painting’s iconic swirling sky has suffered wear-and-tear over time due to light exposure," explains Dr. Helen Lawson, head of restoration at MoMA who leads the team working on 'Starry Night'. 

"However, through our specialized training and knowledge in preserving Van Gogh's original style we are confident that when 'Starry Night’ returns to view it will be as vividly striking for audiences worldwide." As one of the most recognizable artworks globally after its creation back in 1889, MoMA continues to draw large crowds from around the globe.

The decision comes on two years since an unexpected light leak caused by a window crack led to minor damage sustained for 'Starry Night.' A temporary exhibition of Van Gogh's work at MoMA was postponed due to these concerns, but with this restoration progress it is set back in place.

Gallery visitors and art enthusiasts alike seem hopeful about the future return of 'Starry Night,' sharing their sentiment on social media: 

"I can't wait for Starry Night to be restored," tweeted an avid Van Gogh fan, Sarah Williams from Brooklyn. "It has been a highlight in my visits." As work progresses towards completing the restoration of 'Starry night,' MoMA continues its ongoing efforts and plans several additional exhibitions for Vincent van Gogh's collection through 2023-24, promising even more artistic experiences to be enjoyed.
