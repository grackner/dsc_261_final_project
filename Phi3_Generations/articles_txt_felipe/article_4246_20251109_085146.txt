A high-profile NFL game scheduled for Sunday night at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey has been abruptly postponed due to inclement weather conditions threatening severe thunderstener activity and lightning strikes throughout the region, according to a statement from the National Football League (NFL) on Thursday.

The decision came after multiple safety inspections by NFL officials were conducted overnight following heavy rain in New Jersey last night into Wednesday morning. "We do not take these kinds of situations lightly," said Roger Goodell, commissioner for the league, during a press conference this afternoon alongside MetLife Stadium's head security officer and stadium general manager James McCabe.

The postponement applies to Sunday night’s match between the New York Jets and Buffalo Bills, which was expected to draw in a sold-out crowd of around 78,500 fans. The league stated that it will reschedule this game for another date at MetLife Stadium later this season once conditions improve; however, no specific new dates have been announced yet.

As per the meteorological reports issued by AccuWeather on Wednesday night and early Thursday morning, a powerful storm system has developed over southern New Jersey with gusty winds of up to 40 mph predicted in some areas as well as heavy rainfall accumulations expected. The National Weather Service warned that the risk for severe thunderstorm activity is high and lightning strikes have already been reported near Philadelphia, just a short drive from MetLife Stadium where fans were initially scheduled to gather.

"It's an unfortunate turn of events," said James McCabe while addressing reporters this morning at the stadium in New Jersey alongside NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and other officials overseeing game operations, "but we made a difficult decision for everyone involved after consultation with our meteorologists. We deeply regret any inconveniences caused to fans."

The cancellation comes as fan anticipation is already building up ahead of Sunday's matchup between the two division rivals in what has become an annual affair and known amongst NFL enthusiasts for its fierce competition on both offensive sides, including star quarterback Nick Foles leading Buffalo with 20 touchdown passes this season.

"These are hard calls that need to be made from time to time," said McCabe who has worked in stadium operations at MetLife Stadium since before it opened its doors for the first-ever NFL game between the Jets and Eagles last November, "and we understand how disappointing this cancellation is. However, ensuring everyone's safety always comes first."

As of right now, all other games scheduled by the New York division are still on track to proceed as planned for Sunday with no weather-related issues reported so far throughout The Empire State and TriState area which includes parts in Pennsylvania & New Jersey themselves. However, officials continue monitoring updates closely regarding potential delays or disruptions that could impact these matchups over this weekend; therefore fans are urged not to make travel plans until the latest possible moment before game time commences as further announcements may be made closer to their events' scheduled start times.

In a statement released earlier today by Buffalo Bills head coach Sean McDermott, he acknowledged and sympathized with fans who will feel let down but also emphasized
