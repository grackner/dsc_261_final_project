A surprise power outage at Madison Square Garden led to an abrupt end of a crucial NFL preseason game yesterday evening between the New York Giants and Philadelphia Eagles. Around 7:45 PM, local time, with the score tied at 21-21 as halftime neared, lights suddenly went out for all fans inside the iconic arena in midtown Manhattan, located about a mile from Central Park.

The Giants had been leading by one touchdown after two quarters when the blackout occurred without explanation or warning at 7:53 PM ET on September 14th, cutting their lead to nothing as players and coaches struggled for hours in darkness until backup generators kicked in around midnight.

"I've never seen anything like it," said long-time Giants fan Marvin Johnson, who attended the game with his wife and three children at MSG Stadium during halftime break between quarters. "We were halfway through our hot dogs when we noticed that no one was cheering anymore."

"It felt eerie being there by myself," added another spectator named Carol Smith while standing in line to purchase a ticket for the 8 p.m show with her sister on Saturday night before heading home around midnight after waiting about an hour and half at MSG Stadium without seeing much action due to darkness enveloping stadium seats like dusk overwhelm shadows lurking during twilight hues along New York’thighway lanes.

According to officials, the blackout affected approximately 10,000 fans inside and another estimated two million people watching from homes across five boroughs of New York City as live broadcast footage ceased in progress on all major television networks around this time due not only power failure but network coverage issues resulting directly related with unexpected interruptions caused by unforeseen emergency service requests which prompted temporary local media blackouts.

The Giants' head coach, Pat Shurmur said later about halting play during night games when faced suddenly without electricity: "This is not the experience I want for my players or our fans." He added that they will review safety protocols and measures going forward to prepare better should similar incidents happen again.

"We're looking at everything - power systems, generators," said New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio during an impromptu press conference yesterday evening before taking his usual ride on the Brooklyn-A train home with wife Chirlane McCourt who commented simply stating: "I feel like we need better infrastructure in this city."

Officials are still investigating what caused a sudden blackout at Madison Square Garden while game reporters, players themselves and thousands of fans expressed their outrage online about being stuck inside the darkened arena with little entertainment or revenue due to broken power lines causing massive interruptions. Some reports suggest that localized overloads might have contributed alongside possible human error as potential factors behind this unfortunate event during what was supposed to be an exciting preseason game between two of New York's most storied teams - the Giants and Eagles, both with loyal fan bases in metropolitan areas surrounding NYC.

In addition to investigations by relevant authorities seeking answers regarding safety hazards posed within venues such as MSG stadiums across city limits including future planning measures against possible recurrence of similar incidents during high-stakes games where millions' livelihoods
