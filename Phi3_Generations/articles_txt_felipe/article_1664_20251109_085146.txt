A powerful earthquake struck Mexico City on Saturday morning with a preliminary magnitude of 7.1. The tremor was felt from various parts of the city and neighboring regions as far away as Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras—reportedly shaking buildings for over two minutes in each country before their residents were able to evacuate safely.

The quake struck at 6:34am local time (21:34 GMT) without warning near the town of San Nicolás de los Adaques, about a one-andinia drive from Mexico City's downtth area and approximately eight miles west of Monterrey. The U.S. Geological Survey estimated that it registered as an 8 on the Richter scale—the highest possible rating.

"We have been fortunate so far; we are still assessing damages but our citizens' safety is my primary concern," said Governor Claudia Pavlovich Mateos of Nuevo Leon state, noting she had activated local emergency services following the initial shockwaves being felt across three countries.

Residents were awoken by a violent shaking that made furniture topple and windows break as they scrambled outside before taking cover in nearby parks or on public squares until tremors subsided after nearly two minutes of constant, rolling motion through all the mentioned areas—Mexico City center quivering for an estimated nine seconds.

"I was at work when I felt this unsettling jolt; everyone just freezes and starts shouting out orders," said 28-year old construction worker Alejandro Ramirez, recalling how he quickly gathered his coworkers in the office tower before running down for their safety. "It's crazy to think that something like this could happen so close by."

Mexican seismologists have been working nonstop since 2017 monitoring increased activity along a previously dormant section of fault lines near Monterrey; they predict aftershocks may continue for weeks or months. Scientists at the UCLA Institute of Geophysics confirmed with satellite data that an underwater plate collision had sparked this week's seismic event, which has since been recorded by over 60 stations across Mexico and as far away south down into Guatemala to Puerto Morelos—the largest harbor town between Atlantic Ocean coastlines.

The Mexican Red Cross is leading a swift evacuation effort for residents in hard-hit communities near the epicenter while local governments are assessing damage done, focusing first on homes and schools that took heavy impact before turning towards commercial areas where businesses may need repairs or rebuilding soon; many shops were still closed due to power outages yesterday afternoon.

"I know everyone is worried about what this means for our future here in Mexico City," said social worker Maria Del Pilar Gutierrez while volunteering at one of the evacuation centers on foot outside San Nicolas de los Adaques, "But right now we need to focus more on ensuring families are safe and sound."

Mexico's Emergency Management Secretariat announced emergency funding will be available for all affected communities as they continue recovery efforts across a devastated region with many still uncertain about their next steps amid this historic tragedy.
