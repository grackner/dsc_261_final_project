In a groundbredependent study conducted in New York City's Central Park on May 15th, researchers have identified an extraordinary phenomenon where wildlife appears to adapt its activities based on urban noise levels and human presence at different times of the day. The comprehensive three-month project monitored various species such as squirrels, birds, and insects with a unique focus being observed in their interactions during park hours when people frequent leisurely walks or engage in recreational activities like jogging after sunrise.

Sarah Thompson, lead ecologist of the study from New York University's Center for Urban Research states that "We found wildlife adjusting to an urban rhythm not dissimilar to human schedules".  Data was collected using non-invasive tracking devices placed on different animals in various park zones. The researchers noted observable patterns where some species were more active during the early morning and late evening, times when foot traffic is significantly lower while others like birds seemed indifferent or unaffected by noise levels at all hours of daylight.

This revelation raises questions about how urban animals will continue to evolve alongside humanity as city living continues to expand worldwide. "The results are certainly intriguing," commented Dr. Michael Reynolds, a renowned wildlife behavioral scientist who wasn't involved in the study but is based at Columbia University’s School of Environmental and Earth Sciences. “Whether or not this ability will help them survive urbanisation remains to be seen.”

The team plans additional research phases aiming to understand these behaviors better, including further assessment on how changes across different seasons might affect the dynamics observed in Central Park's wildlife population during their bustling daytime hours.
