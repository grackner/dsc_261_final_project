Britain's Royal Opera House to Host Historic Ballet Production Set During Edwardian Era in London on June 15th for its Bicentenary Celebrations  
The grand historic setting of the majestic Royal Opera House, a site that has enthralled audiences with operatic and ballet performances since opening over two centuries ago this May Day. This time marks an exceptional moment as they unveil "Grecian Elegance," a one-of-a-kind production inspired by the splendor of Edwardian society, set to run for three months starting from June 15th in preparation for their Bicentenary Celebrations.

"It's an exceptional moment not only because it marks two centuries since our beloved Opera House first opened its doors," says Sir Ian McKellen, Chairman of the Royal Opera House Committee on stage during a recent interview at The O2 Arena in Stratford-upon-Avon where he had just watched "Grecian Elegance." He went on to express his confidence about it being an unparalleled opportunity for both audiences and artists alike.

The production, choreographed by world renowned Alvin Ailey artist Deborah Raffaeli who incorporated traditional Edwardian dances into contemporary movements is aiming at bringing back forgotten aspects of British cultural history while providing an exquisite experience for patrons with its lavish set design. The costumes alone are a sight to behold, boasting intricate lacework and velvet fabrics that reflect the opulence of Edwardian high society portrayed throughout the ballet narrative which spans themes from love's tragedies in 'Sunset Sonnet,' heartbreak at royal balls or even lighthearted misadventures as told through dances like 'The Naughty Duchess.'

"Edwardians lived their lives under strict social etiquette and rules but there is always room for a little mischief, that's what we wanted to capture in our story," says the production director of "Grecian Elegance." 

Critics are already hailing it as one-of-a-kind spectacle where they see an innovative fusion between historic dance forms with modern narratives while praising its eye-catching costumes and stunning sets. With tickets priced at £150 per adult, the production expects to draw not only local audience but also international ones who will flock from all corners of Britain for this grand event that celebrates British cultural history along with modern interpretations brought forth by talented artists like Raffaeli and a skilled team behind it.

"In my opinion as an artist, I believe there is so much to learn about ourselves through looking at the past - from our culture's roots," says Raffaeli after her recent interview where she discussed how "Grecian Elegance" came into being during a press conference held last month in London.

For those interested and unable to attend, live broadcast of select performances will be available on BBC iPlayer until December 20th giving them an opportunity to revel vicariously through this extraordinary spectacle that the Royal Opera House is proudly presenting once every year since its opening day back when it was first inaugurated as Covent Garden Theatre in May Day, 1858.

The upcoming ballet production stands strong and confident on expectations despite uncertain times where arts often face funding cuts
