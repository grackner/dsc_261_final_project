In a historic vote on Wednesday night in Westminster Parliament House London, British lawmner Liz Truss announced her resignation as Prime Minister of United Kingdom amidst economic turmoil and political instability within the Conservative party. Moments after she submitted her letter to King Charles III—the head of state at that time—and Queen Elizabeth II read it aloud in a rare act, there was silence before they left for an afternoon tea on Thursday morning as all eyes turned towards Boris Johnson to step up and potentially assume the role.

The announcement came after Truss's ill-advised mini-budget caused investors across Europe to panic about Britain’s economic future, leading not only her downfall but also bringing the country to its knees as financial markets crumbled under pressure from record lows in pound sterling. Experts have since warned that Truss's policies were at odds with mainstream economics and caused a significant drop of national confidence among Britons, leading many experts including Professor Michael Taylor, Senior Economist for Capital Economics London to warn the public: "The country needs stability now more than ever."

As Prime Minister during these testing times, Truss attempted several measures that aimed at boosting economic growth but only led her down a path of unemployment and fear. The mini-budget announced by Truss last month saw UK interest rates surge to their highest in 13 years—further plunging the country into an energy crisis as inflation hit record highs, with food prices skyrocketing along side it all before spiraling further out of control within days.

The decision for resignation came after Truss admitted during a cabinet meeting that her economic plan was flawed and caused fear among investors across Europe who were seeing their assets devalued against the pound due to market instability, which is widely attributed as one reason behind Boris Johnson's hesitation in stepping up. "There comes a time when we have to make difficult decisions," said Truss on Wednesday night after her cabinet meeting where she revealed plans for an emergency budget that will aim at reducing the country’s financial burden, while also promising economic reforms and job creation measures across all sectors of UK economy.

In a statement read aloud by King Charles III himself—the moment marking Truss' resignation official- as he stated: “After consultation with His Majesty The King (and Her Grace the Queen), it is hereby announced that Ms Liz Truss has tendered her resignation from office. She was formerly Prime Minister of Britain.” As a result, several senior cabinet members and ministers have since lost their posts as well; furthermore Johnson's own position remains uncertain amidst growing pressure for him to either form an alternative government or accept the invitation by Parliament Speaker Martin Sixsmith that Truss formally tender her resignation.

A spokesman from Downing Street has not yet confirmed whether Prime Minister Boris will step up, and several senior officials within his party have suggested a sense of urgency in selecting Johnson as their leader while assuring the country they would work to bring stability back into its economy for better future prospects: "We are working tirelessly towards bringing this crisis under control," said Treasury Secretary Jeremy Hunt.
