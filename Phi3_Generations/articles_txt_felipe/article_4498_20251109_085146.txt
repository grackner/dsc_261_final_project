Economic Tensions Rise as U.S.-China Trade Talks Falter on Tariffs and Intellectual Property Disputes: Expert Analysis - Business Markets Now (CNN)

March 30, The article highlighted the recent stalemate in US-China trade talks that kicked off last month. Representatives from both nations met twice this week without making substantial progress towards resolving contentious issues like tariffs and intellectual property rights enforcement. As negotiations appear to be faltering once again following discussions held behind closed doors at the White House, market analysts are beginning to brace for continued economic impact on global markets as of Tuesday afternoon rounds up an article written in a style that seeks factual reporting with journalistic tone and structure.

As tensions continue to rise between both countries over unfair trade practices and intellectual property theft, neither side appears willing or able to give ground this time around since talks commenced last month under President Trump'in direction. According to official sources close to negotiations, discussions have now hit an impasse with regards to tariffs on Chinese goods entering U.S., further escalating fears that a deal could remain elusive beyond the current meeting scheduled for Thursday afternoon in Washington D.C.

"We are at this critical juncture where both parties need to show flexibility if they want any positive outcome from these negotiations," stated Sarah Chen, senior economist with Global Market Insights on Tuesday morning ahead of today's discussions while adding that the last few rounds have seen little movement despite promising starts at each session.

The U.S.' chief negotiator John Smith echoed her concerns during an interview earlier this week saying: "We can only move forward if Beijing demonstrates willingness to address our long-standing grievances about the trade imbalance and forced technology transfers." China's spokespner, Zhang Wei also voiced similar sentiments in a press conference yesterday afternoon with him commenting that any resolution would require reciprocal measures from both sides rather than demands.

Market reactions since news broke about the impasse were immediate; shares of American companies doing business heavily with China dropped sharply while global markets felt uncertainty spread across different sectors on Monday morning as investors braced themselves for more fallout in case a deal is not struck by week's end.

"We can still work towards an agreement but there needs to be some concessions from both sides before any real progress," said David Miller, professor of international relations at Harvard University who has been following the ongoing trade talks closely over several months now while emphasizing that time is running out and urging negotiators not to let political pressures derail what could otherwise prove beneficial for all parties.

As Thursday's meeting approaches later this afternoon, there remains little consensus about how long these rounds will go on with or when they might finally produce any meaningful headway towards a deal that addresses both countries concerns while fostering fairer trading practices and mutual respect between U.S.-China relations but experts caution against overly optimistic projections pointing out several challenges ahead before negotiations can even be said to truly commence once again at this week's meeting since last year talks ended without any significant progress being made towards resolution of the issues that started back in 2018 when President Trump first threatened tariffs on billions worth Chinese goods
