JERUSALEM – A groundbrein technology center opened its doors in Israel's bustling tech hub yesterday with ambitious plans to foster innovation and cultivate a new generation of startups, according to The Jerusalem Post. Hundreds of entrepreneurs descended on Tel Aviv-Yafo Metropolitan Area for the inauguration ceremony at 10:00 AM local time.

“We are excited about this center as it represents our commitment towards building a strong tech community in Israel,” said Danny Barkat, Minister of Communication and Information Technology during his speech to an enthusiastic audience including investors from Silicon Valley and leading venture capitalists based around Tel Aviv.

Israel's Ministry of Economy estimates that the country is home to over 200 tech startups per month with a growing share contributing significantly towards national GDP, which stood at $36 billion last year alone as reported by The Jerusalem Post in February this year. However, experts believe Israel can boost its position even further on global innovation platforms through the establishment of more technology centers like ‘Innova-Tel’ – one among a growing number already operational across Europe and North America aimed at facilitating entrepreneurs to launch their tech ventures.

“We have always been pioneers, but now is our time,” stated Noa Yaffe-Lazardan, CEO of Innova-Tel who shared her vision about the center’s purpose: "At its heart, this technology hub represents an ecosystem that not only supports startups financially and mentally; it provides a nurturing space for them to grow.”

The state-of-the-art facility designed by Israeli architect Yosef Harpak also promises cutting edge technological infrastructure aimed at supporting the rapidly evolving needs of tech entrepreneurs. 15 startups are already based here, which include companies focused on artificial intelligence and cybersecurity – both vital sectors for Israel’s burgeoning economy.

Among them is 'SapiSec', a young startup founded by Israeli cryptography expert Avi Ben-David who has been lauded internationally for his innovative work in the field of digital security, and 'AINow' led by Yael Keren – another promising venture based on Machine Learning. Both companies have found it crucial to collaborate with like-minded peers at InnovaTel while benefiting from accessibility to industry experts as part of a mentorship program developed in partnership between the center and Israel's leading universities such as Tel Aviv University, Hebrew University Jerusalem branch.

Innova-Tel will operate on an open plan concept where entrepreneurs can work alongside each other while benefiting from round table discussions with industry experts facilitated by Innova-Tel’s director of operations Yosef Benyaouh and his team who have extensive experience in technology hubs across Europe.

"It's like a melting pot, where different ideas mix together to create something fantastic – that is what the heartbeat of this center feels like every day,” said Avi Ben-David after sharing how InnovaTel’s community helped him overcome challenges faced by his startup SapiSec.

Minister Barkat and CEO Yaffe Lazzardan echoed similar sentiments in their respective speeches – emphasizing on
