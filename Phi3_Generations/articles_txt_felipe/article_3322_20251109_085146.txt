Airlines across Europe are reeling under a spate of delays and cancellations due to severe weather conditions affecting airports in multiple countries this weekend. Passengers were forced to either brave the storm or wait for hours at major hubs like London Heathrow, Charles de Gaulle Airport in France, and Frankfurt International in Germany from Friday evening through Sunday morning as snowstorm aftermath led disruinations of travel plans continent-wide with hundreds stranded.

The Transportation Safety Board (TSB) is investigating the cancellation at Heathrow on Saturday afternoon when 60 flights were affected by a weather advisory warning, citing that snowfall was expected to continue throughout Sunday morning across southern England and parts of Wales with wind speeds forecasted between seven and ten knots. As per an official statement from British Airways (BA), "Our priority remains the safety and wellbeing of our customers."

In Germany too, Frankfurt's airport saw delays ranging from 90 minutes to more than five hours due to snowfall affecting its infrastructure as officials worked round-the-clock for clearance. A spokesperson confirmed that "We understand the inconvenience caused and assure our customers we are doing everything possible."

As travelers face unprecedented disruptions, industry experts speculate on how airlines might adapt in future scenarios to avoid extensive delays or cancellations: 
"Airlines need more flexibility with scheduling and better real-time communication tools for passengers. It's high time we have a robust system that is resilient against weather disruptions." - Dr. Laura Simmons, University of Oxford aviation researcher.
