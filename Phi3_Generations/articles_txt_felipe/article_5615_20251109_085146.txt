In an unprecedented move against organized crime, Indian police have apprehended a prominent figure in national drug trafficking operations last Thursday near Mumbai's financial district of Bandra. The arrest was the result of months-long investigation by Interpol and local law enforcement agencies who believed they had enough evidence to bring down this significant player in illegal activities that have impacted communities across India for years.

Authorities say Mohammed Hussain, a 42-year-enzymatic engineer from Hyderabad with no previous criminal record before turning informant around two years ago after being threatened by the drug cartel's powerful leader - Dawood Ibrahim Khan alias Dacoit Kingpin. According to sources close to the investigation team, Hussain has been using his technical expertise and access privileges in different sectors of Mumbai’s economy as a cover for facilitating narcotics movement through underground supply chains from Afghanistan into India since 2016.

The arrest came after months spent surveilling suspicious activities led by Hussain, including frequent late-night clandestine meetings at local train stations and nightclubs in the Bandra area where he would allegedly exchange drugs for money from associates of Dawood Ibrahim Khan’s gang.

"He's always been a man with few scruples," said one source who claims to have worked alongside Mohammed Hussain at various engineering firms throughout Mumbai, before coming forward as an informant himself two years ago after seeing first-hand the rampant drug trade corrupting his city’s engineers and entrepreneurs alike.

In a statement released from behind bars on Friday morning by Interpol spokesperson Riaz Khan who confirmed Mohammed Hussain's capture as well as several other significant arrests of cartel associates linked to the drug operation, "Our agents successfully executed numerous search and seizure operations leading us closer every day towards dismantling one of India’s most notorious criminal syndicates. We thank our partners in law enforcement for their dedicated work against this organized crime threat."

"The arrest is a significant victory," said Assistant Inspector General Avinash Khanna who leads investigations into the drug trafficking operations centered around Mumbai, "but it's just one step forward. We know Dacoit Kingpin and his cohort operate in various parts of India using similar tactics that have helped them evade authorities for years."

Mohammed Hussain was not alone during this operation - he had an alleged associate named Aman Kumar Rao, a 35-year old software engineer who hails from Bangalore and is considered another key player in Dacoit Kingpin's drug trafficking network operating out of Hyderabad with ties to the Nizamuddin Triad - one group that has reportedly been behind numerous high profile cases like assassinations, extortions across India since their rise into power through criminal means.

"Knowledge is power," said a top official who requested anonymity in court on Friday morning during his testimony after being interrogated last month for ties to the Nizamuddin Triad which he denies any involvement with, "In this fight against organized crime we must ensure no stone remains unturned. It will take more than just arrests and convictions
