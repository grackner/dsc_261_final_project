A massive explosion rocked a bustling market in Baghdad on Wednesday morning, April 15th, leaving hundreds injured and causing significant damage to the area's infrastructure. The blast occurred just as merchants were preparing for day-long sales at one of the oldest markets in Iraq known as Al-Iraqi Souk (السوق العراقي), situated near the city center and frequented by locals and tourists alike. Witnesses reported hearing a deafening sound followed almost immediately by shattering glass and chaotic scenes of people running for cover, as plumes of smoke rose into the sky above Iraq's capital.

Emergency responders rushed to the scene moments after calls were made at around 9:0th AM local time (13:0h GMT). The fire department confirmed that a section of one building collapsed, and several others suffered significant structural damage due to what they believe could be caused by an underground gas leak. Officials are still investigating the incident but insist there is no evidence pointing towards terrorism or any other form of criminal act at this time.

"We have never seen anything like it," said Lt.-Colonel Ammar Abbas, spokesperson for Baghdad's fire department while standing near some damaged shops and a charred building facade. "But rest assured, we are doing our utmost to rescue survivors."

As of 10:30 AM local time (15:30 GMT), Iraqi officials announced that at least fifty individuals had been brought into the hospital with varying degrees of injury from burns and shrapnel wounds. Many more people are still being treated on-site, but a clearer picture will be established over the next several hours as rescue operations continue unabated in one of Baghdad's busiest areas.

The explosion happened amid heightened tensions within Iraq following an increase in violence across various provinces since October last year, leading to fear among locals that sectarian or terrorist acts are imminent at any moment. While this incident did not fit into those parameters thus far, authorities warned they remain on high alert as the nation experiences continued instability and unpredictable attacks from armed groups within its territory; a situation worsened by escalating international sanctions since May of 2021 over alleged involvement with terrorist organizations such as ISIS.

Mayor Faisal Majeed, who has been at the epicenter working alongside rescue crews and local officials to coordinate relief efforts in Al-Iraqi Souk remarked, "We need all hands on deck now more than ever." A statement from his office read: "The safety of our citizens remains paramount above everything else - no matter what challenges come our way. We have faith that with united determination and strength among the Baghdadi people; we will overcome this dark period in Iraq's history as a whole".

Rescue operations continue while firefig01d3r department officials work to extinguish any possible outbreak of secondary fires caused by gas leaks near collapsed buildings. The entire community is holding its breath, hoping for speedy recovery and relief from this horrendous tragedy that has rocked the heartbeat of their city's historical soul: Al-Iraqi Souk - Baghdad.
