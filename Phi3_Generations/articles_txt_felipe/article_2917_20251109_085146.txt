Scientists at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center are investigating an unusual weather pattern that emerged over the Midwest last week and has since spread to neighboring states with alarming speed and intensity, reports CNN. The phenomenon was first noticed on March 12 when meteorologists observed a strange cloud formation hovering above Kansas City but rapidly intensified by Thursday evening into what experts are calling an "atmospheric anomaly."

As of this morning, the National Weather Service (NWS) has issued flash flood warnings to several states as heavy rains and severe winds continue unabated for over 48 hours. Local officials in Kansas City have reported hazardous driving conditions due to poor visibility caused by an impenetrable fog that's formed within this anomaly, with one official stating, "The combination of these weather events has caught us off guard."

"This isn't something we see often," explains Dr. Emily Turner, a leading meteorologist at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center who is part of the investigation team for this peculiar event. She adds that while similar patterns have been documented before in other parts of the world such as Europe and Asia, it has never occurred simultaneously across multiple states within North America before."We suspect there could be some sort of unusual atmospheric pressure system at play here," Dr. Turner told CNN via email interview today from her lab near Goddard's command center where she is analyzing weather satellite data related to the anomaly, as well assisting local forecasters in tracking its progress."

In addition to these unexpected meteorological conditions, some residents have shared concerns about potential long-term effects on their health and property. "I never expected a trip down Main Street would turn into an environmental catastrophe," says John Ramirez who lives near the Missouri River just outside Kansas City where floodwaters are starting to recede after days of relentless rain, CNN reports.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is monitoring the situation closely while working with local authorities across state lines in a coordinated response effort involving evacuations and providing emergency shelters for those displaced by flooding waters," states a statement from FEMA spokesperson yesterday released to CNN.

As scientists continue studying this unusual event, weather forecasters warn that the pattern could persist well into next week depending on changing atmospheric conditions in which more than 14 inches of rainfall has been recorded at various monitoring stations across Missouri alone since Friday afternoon."It's going to take some time for us all to fully recover from this devastating situation," says Mayor Linda Givens as she met with concerned citizens after touring flood-hit areas today, per the Kansas City Star.

In response to these ongoing extreme weather conditions, President Joe Biden has declared a federal disaster emergency for Missouri and other impacted states where millions of dollars in relief funds are being allocated by FEMA as aid is needed now more than ever," adds Givens about efforts underway at the national level.
