A massive flood in Kerala has claimed at least three lives and displaced thousands of people as it swelled on Monday along a major river that flows into one of India's busiest waterways. Heavy rains, which are forecast to continue well through the weekend with little relief expected until mid-November or early December when the monsoon season ends and Cyclone Kyarr is projected to hit Western Australia in January 2nervousness among residents of Kozhikode district as waters rose rapidly.

Residents were forced out their homes after water levels reached alarming heights, with reports coming from at least three different locations along the Periyar River where people sought refuge on nearby rooftops and makeshift platforms for safety. The local government issued evacuation orders to thousands of residents in affected areas such as Kozhikode township and surrounding villages after sensing a potential threat earlier today before rain pounded parts of Kerala over the weekend, submerging large swathes under inches or even feet of water at times.

Local authorities have now confirmed that there were three casualties – all victims found lifeless in their homes near Pottippara village on Sunday afternoon when torrential rains poured down through Kerala for hours, causing rivers like Periyar to swell and burst its banks overwhelmingly. It wasn't just flooding that took a turn towards devastation; fallen trees have blocked roads in several areas with water levels still rising due largely attributed the deluge from last nights thunderstorm which continued through late into Sunday evenings before receding slightly by early afternoon Monday, leaving deep scars across vast stretches of farmland and flooded homes.

"It is a dreadful situation that we cannot avoid facing as climate change has made such events more frequent," said Dr Mani Krishnan from the Indian Meteorological Department who provided updated forecasts warning about further rains until this weekend while advising caution due to potential flash-flooding once waters recede. "We're preparing for worst cases, ensuring our evacuation centers are ready and providing resources such as food packs if needed."

In Kozhikode township itself where some 60% of district population lives along Periyar riverbanks between Manakkudi bridge and Thamarazhi Bridge near Mango Palli, about two dozen temporary shelters with space for up to 25 people each are being established by the state disaster response unit which started mobilizing aid trucks packed full of essential supplies earlier today when floodwaters began rising uncomfortably high in some neighborhoods and villages located close-by where many still reside.

The government has also begun setting up makeshift platforms on rooftops throughout the area as a precautionary measure, while local communities are doing their best to stay together amidst this crisis which came so quickly after heavy rains had already submerged low-lying areas including parts of Kozhikode township under knee or waist deep waters by early Saturday evening before beginning its march towards the sea around midnight.

"It's a very scary feeling when you see water coming up your doorstep with nowhere to go," said 48-year old local Shankar who lost his home and most of possessions after rising floodwaters inundated all three rooms just before sunrise Sunday morning
