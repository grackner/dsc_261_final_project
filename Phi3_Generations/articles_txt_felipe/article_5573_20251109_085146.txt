A magnitude-9 earthquake has struck Japan near Fukushima prefecture on Saturday night at around 10:25pm local time, causing panic and extensive damage across the region. Residents of coastal towns were shaken awake by a tremor powerful enough to rattle windows in urban areas over 30 miles away from the epicenter offshore Sakhalin Island near Russia's Far East coastline.

Authorities quickly confirmed that two people have been killed and dozner reported as missing after initial reports of injuries emerged, with around a dozen buildings collapsed in Fukushima city alone, which is about 20 miles from the epicenter. Japan’s Meteorological Agency (JMA) has classified it at magnitude-9 on the Richter scale – one level below last year's deadly quake near Kumamoto that killed more than a thousand people and injured tens of thousands in Miyazaki prefecture, about 200 miles to the west.

"This was an unexpected tremor with high intensity," said Chief Meteorological Agency forecaster Hiroki Mochida during late-night live broadcasts on TNN Japan News Channel yesterday evening; quoting from his statement: "We're still monitoring aftershock sequences and are working to provide continuous updates."

Sakhalin Island, which lies about 50 miles off Russia’s Pacific coastline at the border between Russian Far East (Primorsky Kray) region of Vladivostok Metropolitan Area on one side – overlapping with part of northwest Japan's Shimane Prefecture and southwestern Kyushu - is known for its regular seismic activity. But a shock this strong hasn’t been felt by the Japanese mainland since that quake last year; according to JMA chief, "this one was even stronger."

Emergency services were on high alert as they responded quickly to reports of collapsed homes and crumbled buildings – many in Fukushima city alone. Local mayor Akihiro Hatsuki reported at least 12 structures had been reduced into rubble, including a public park where more than 50 people sought shelter before daylight. "We are trying our best to rescue trapped individuals as fast as possible," he said in an urgent appeal yesterday evening during live broadcasts on NHK’s Japan News; with his voice cracking under emotion: “There may have been others still inside buildings, we don't know yet."

Emergency workers were searching hard for survivors amidst the wreckage of homes and offices – fearful that they might be trapped deep beneath piles of collapsed timber. Residents who had evacuated to local schools due to tsunami warnings issued after last year's deadly quake reported hearing loud noises from crumbling structures as shakes intensified during the night; with one former resident, Yasuaki Nakao recalled: “I thought it might be a gas leak – but then I heard windows rattling on this side of town too. It was definitely an earthquake.”

A spokesperson for Japan's National Police Agency confirmed four people were still reported missing in the city, while about 20 others had been injured and transported to hospitals; adding: "Our search continues until everyone is accounted for." Official rescue operations began yesterday morning as crews comb through rubble of Fuk
