"Los Angeles— In a move that has captivated Los Angeles and Hollywood alike, 'Glamour & Glitz' premiered last night on ABC at Universal Studios Lot in front of an eager audience including celebrities like Tom Hanks, Jennifer Lawrence, and Robert Downey Jr. The anticipation was palpable since the show announcement just two weeks prior."

The highly-awaited television series 'Glamour & Glitz' aired last night as part of ABC’ endless quest for hit shows that can compete with streaming giants Netflix and Amazon Prime Video. With its mix of sophisticated humor, star power, glitzy costumes, stunning visuals, the show is sure to be an instant favorite among viewers looking for escapism from their daily lives—especially during these trying times amidst a global pandemic that has kept many at home.

Directed by seasoned filmmaker Ava Smith (famed for her previous work on 'Game of Thrones' and the Oscar-nominated short, 'The Lost Generation'), this is set to be an unforgettable television experience as seen through a camera lens capturing behind-the-scenes footage from various film sets.

"I am thrilled about tonight's launch of my newest project and I couldn't have hoped for a better way than celebrating on our own turf, Universal Studios Lot," Smith commented in an exclusive interview with ABC News. "With the current climate making things feel so uncertain - watching shows like 'Glamour & Glitz,' is all we can do right now."

Catching sneak peeks at tonight's event were Tom Hanks, Jennifer Lawrence and Robert Downey Jr., who appeared via pre-recorded messages. The former actors expressed their enthusiasm for Smith's work: "I knew about this project since it first came to my attention—Ava has never failed me," said Tom Hanks in a recorded message shared on social media, while Jennifer Lawrence chimed in with her own video clip saying she hoped viewers found joy and excitement within the series.

Despite not having all scenes shot yet due to time constraints, fans were still treated to an elaborate premiere event featuring live music performances by Grammy Award-winning artist Sia (singing alongside guest star Chris Pratt) with set design inspired directly from their favorite episodes of 'Glamour & Glitz.'

"I never thought I'd see the day where my childhood cartoons would be reimagined this way," said local resident and long-time fan, 12-year-old Danielle Ramirez during our exclusive interview. "This premiere felt like stepping into a time machine!"

In an effort to maintain social distancing guidelines amidst the ongoing pandemic—which has halted countless productions nationwide—the event took place without studio personnel being present, instead streamed directly from Los Angeles's 'Hollywood Hills.' The entire cast and crew members attended virtually via holographic projections.

"The way we produced this show was unlike anything done before," Smith commented on how filming has continued remotely for the majority of scenes shot to date, "We are living in uncertain times but I believe that 'Glamour & Glitz' will be a glimmer of hope and joy through its stories."
