Washington Redskins Alumni: Former Running Back Runs for Community in Crisis  

December 12, 2023 – Washington, D.CThe NFL veteran who made waves as a running back with the Washington Commanders now serves on the ground at home where it's needed most—the community ravaged by this year’s hurricane season in New Orleans.

Former Redskins starter Chris Johnson (35), once known for his explosive runs and 1,894 career rushing yards during a five-year tenure with the team from 2012 to 2016 has now found purpose off of the field by assisting local relief efforts.

“I’ve never seen anything like it," says Johnson who spent most Sundays cheering on his fellow New Orleans Saints fans during tailgating parties at Tiger Place, a neighborhood in Gentilly Heights where many NFL alumni reside. "The community came together and that spirit of unity I remember from my playing days is alive here now."

Johnson began volunteering after witnessing the devastation firsthand when he visited relatives last month; his grandparents’ home sustained heavy flood damage while several family friends lost everything to hurricane Ian. "I knew it was time for me do something more than just send some money," Johnson shares with CNN New Orleans, adding that a former teammate invited him over this weekend so he could personally help clear mud and debris from yards of the elderly couple living nearby his grandparents' home in what’s known as Foldit Court.

He estimates around 150 families were directly affected by Ian, including Johnson whose family had to evacuate but managed safely during mandatory citywide shelter-in-place orders imposed last month due a forecasted second landfall from Hurricane Nicole that never materialized as predicted; the Redskins alumni running back is not alone in helping his community rebuild after two consecutive devastating hurricanes this year.

"Our neighbors are strong, and I see people working together every day," says local business owner Michael Thomas who owns a corner grocery store which serves as an unofficial gathering point for many of the impacted families during their daily clean-up efforts while Johnson helps with yard work on Sundays. "They’re relying on all hands to lift them up, and it feels good helping in any way I can."

New Orleans Saints cornerback Terrance Winwood who played alongside former Redskins teammate Chris Smith during his days at LSU also lends a hand with clean-up efforts himself; he says Johnson’s dedication inspires more locals to join the relief work. “He sets an example on how important this is for our community," explains Terrance Winwood who has been working alongside fellow alumni Chris Smith (also in their twenties) at a local church food pantry since September; he adds that NFL veterans have historically always supported non-profits and charities within the city they call home. "The Redskins community is here to stay, no matter how it's going on football."

Johnson’s efforts continue as residents prepare for another round of hurricane relief training this coming weekend hosted by local authorities which will teach attendees proper safety protocol while conducting physical labor such a-building temporary shelters or removing fallen trees from road
