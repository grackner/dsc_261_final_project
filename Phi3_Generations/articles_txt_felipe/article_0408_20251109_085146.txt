In a groundbredependent breakthrough at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore yesterday evening, Dr. Alice Thompson and her team have identified an enzyme that could potentially reverse cellular aging. At age 35, the discovery by this research group marks what they believe to be humanity's first step towards conquering old age itself – a feat previously thought unattainable with our current scientific capabilities.

During their study conducted last month in Baltimore using mice models and cell cultures within lab-controlled environments, the team successfully observed restoration of youthful characteristics including enhanced muscle strength, improved cognition and an increased lifespan. The researchers anticipate a similar effect could occur when applied to humans; however, more extensive trials are needed before any firm conclusions can be drawn about its efficacy or safety for human use.

"This is the first indication that we might not only slow down aging but reverse it," said Dr. Thompson in an interview with CNN this afternoon as she described their findings during a press conference at Johns Hopkins University's School of Medicine yesterday evening, calling to mind images and stories about time travel from popular science fiction media which has inspired many researchers around the globe for decades now - but never quite materialized in real life before.

The mice models used as subjects during these experimental trials were aged artificially by altering their DNA through CRISPR gene-editing technology, resulting initially in signs similar to those associated with human aging such as gray hair and decreased muscle strength which could not be reversed using current methods. After application of this newly discovered enzyme treatment however, these 'aged' mice showed remarkable improvements that resembled rejuvenation - shedding their grey fur back into a youthful brown-black color while also gaining better memory function and increased mobility similar to young adults without such physical declines.

While Dr. Thompson expressed cautious optimism about the results of this study, warning that there is still much research needed before applying these findings directly onto humans as well expressing concern over potential ethical implications or unforeseen side effects if improperly administered - her team plans on commencing human clinical trials by next year after additional lab testing and safety evaluations are completed.

"Though we understand this discovery offers exciting possibilities for treating age-related diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson’s or even heart disease," commented Dr. Thompson about potential real-world applications beyond just combating signs of physical aging themselves while also acknowledging the risks associated with prematurely adopting any new technology based upon a few promising lab results alone without adequate precautionary research and testing, "it remains vital to proceed carefully into future human trials."

Johns Hopkins University's ethics committee is currently reviewing their application for these upcoming studies after concerns raised by some members who feel that this discovery should not be rushed into treatment protocols just yet. 
Dr. Paul Reynolds, a member of the university's Bioethics Board expressed similar worries saying in an interview yesterday: "While we want to celebrate such discoveries and innovation - progress must never come at too high risk for patients or society as whole." The final decision regarding whether human trials will go ahead is expected within coming months.

The scientific community worldwide has already taken note of this pioneering research, with many calling it a watershed
