In a significant development in global politics today, Egypt and Israel have announced plans to establish full diplomatic relations starting from May next year. The historic agreement is set on June 30 at the official White House residence where President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt has met with U.S. President Joe Biden for a private discussion about normalizing ties between both nations, CNN reports.

The move comes nearly two decthy years after Israel agreed to withdraw from territories occupied since the 1967 Mideast war—a step widely hailed as one of its biggest concessions in recent memory. Egypt has also taken steps towards this goal by announcing that it would not demand full Israeli sovereignty over disputed lands, such as Gaza and East Jerusalem; instead, the two nations agreed to jointly manage those areas while affirming their right for each nation's citizenship therein.

Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shukry told reporters that both sides intend to sign a peace treaty in late August or early September if parliamentary elections next month go as planned, stating: "We believe this deal will create more stability and opportunities for our people." Egypt has invited Israel's foreign minister Yair Linforth for formal negotiations on July 25.

Experts weighed in saying that such a step would not only bring economic prosperity but also peace to the region, which many believe is long overdue due to years of conflict between Palestinians and Israeli settlers across occupied territories dating back decades ago - with numerous instances leading up until today marking violence erupted frequently. "It's a significant leap forward towards resolving one aspect that has led us into so much turmoil," said former diplomat Amal Nassar, who was involved in earlier attempts at mediation between Arab nations and Israel during the early 2010s when relations began to thaw. "I'm hopeful this is just a start."

Several Palestinian leaders had initially expressed concern that their own people would not benefit from these agreements, with Hamas spokesman Iyad Tamimi saying on Twitter: "We call upon our brothers in Gaza to demand the same commitments for all parties involved. We refuse to let empty words and promises destroy hope of peace." However, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas seemed open-minded towards these developments but remained cautious about their implications on future relations with Israel while urging negotiations continue: "We welcome positive progress toward achieving a two state solution based upon international law and UN resolutions," he said in an emailed statement to Palestinian news agency Ma'an.

The United Nations praised the agreement, stating that it could serve as "a catalyst for peace" between Israelis and Palestinians—something Secretary-General Antonio Guterres termed a "glimmer of hope," while warning against any backsliding into violence during negotiations or following elections later this month.

Experts believe the full diplomatic ties will bring about greater economic prosperity, with many predicting that Egypt's port city Alexandria and Israel’s Haifa are set to become new hubs for trade between Arab nations in North Africa and Europe as well as Asia-Pacific regions respectively. As Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid put it during a joint press conference: "The opening of the Suez Canal bypass will bring about
