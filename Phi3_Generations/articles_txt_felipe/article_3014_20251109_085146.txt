Major League Baseball announces plan to implement expanded rosters for postseason games starting next season in a bid to increase fan engagement and viewership numbers across America's pastime since the COVID-19 pandemic led to an abbreviated regular season last year, according to MLB officials. The policy change will see each team playing with up to 28 players instead of their traditional rosters limited to 26 by league rules; this includes allowing unlimited doubleheaders and a one player's day off during the extended playoffs that now run through November due in part, reportedly, to increased interest from international fans.

The expansion is being rolled out across all MLB stadiums nationwide as teams prepare for what promises an exciting postseason with more on-field action and a chance to see new players making their debut games under the bright lights of October baseball. "We want every fan experience, right down to the last pitcher that takes homeownership trophies into his arms," said MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred at yesterday's virtual press conference with team executives from around the league who approved the policy changes following months of discussions on improving attendance and engagement levels in both live games and televised events.

Eleven-year veteran pitcher, Chris Carpenter of the St Louis Cardinals told ESPN "I've never seen a season quite like it" with fans returning to stadiums across MLB after years spent watching from home during COVID lockdowns which were felt even more by those who could only travel within state lines as most spectators opted for virtual attendance options until recently. The expanded rosters will make up teams that have seen an influx of young talent emerge this year while allowing older veterans like Carpenter himself to play in postseason games they would not otherwise be able to participate due primarily to health concerns following the pandemic as well as prioritizing players with families who might want extra days off during extended periods.

The changes come at a crucial time when major league teams such as Toronto Blue Jays and Boston Red Sox have seen record attendance levels return since fans were first allowed back inside stadiums in late May after overcoming fears surrounding transmission of COVID-19; numbers which continued to grow throughout summer season, with last Saturday's Opening Day Game between the Houston Astros & Los Angeles Dodgers selling out within minutes even though it wasn't actually played due another postponement this year caused by weather issues. 

"We understand concerns about fans attending games during a pandemic but trust us when we say our teams have been playing well under strict health guidelines that prioritize safety for both players and spectators," said Houston Astros President Andy MacPhail at the team's press conference yesterday while acknowledging growing public sentiment calling on sports leagues to expand rosters. "We love seeing kids come up through our system, playing in live action games but we also recognize how important it is for family-friendly teams like us that everyone gets a fair chance."

MLB officials said they are confident these changes will not only help increase attendance and fan engagement levels at the stadium as well on television screens nationwide through year-end playoffs leading up to World Series championships in November. "Our goal is simple - make sure every game delivers an unforgettable experience for everyone involved while doing our best to give families more time together during extended periods," said San Francisco Giants President of Baseball Operations Farhan Zaidi
