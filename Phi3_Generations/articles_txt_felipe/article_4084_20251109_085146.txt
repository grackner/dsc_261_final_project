As fitness enthusiasts and athletes across the country continue to take their passion for health seriously amidst a rising wave of obesity rates in children under ten, medical experts are now calling on parents nationwide to encourage physical activity from an early age as part of overall well-being. A recent survey conducted by researchers at Boston Children's Hospital found that only 30% of kids participate regularly in sports or structured exercise programs outside school hours, while a separate study released last month revealed sedentary behavior has risen among children over the past five years.

Dr. Elizabeth Thompson, Chief Pediatric Cardiologist at Boston Children's Hospital and one of those who conducted these studies says, "Our kids are not getting enough physical activity in their daily lives to maintain a healthy weight." She adds that this is especially concerning for children under ten since they need ample opportunities every day - whether through organized activities or informal games at the park. 

Despite multiple local and national initiatives, advocates say there's still much work left in reversing these trends with parents playing a vital role to motivate their kids from early stages of childhood towards lifelong habits for fitness and overall health benefits that come along with it. 

Jenna Sullivan, an elementary school teacher sharing her experience on the importance of physical activity among children says "We see our students during recess time as they run around or play games together -it's a joy to watch kids having fun while being active." She adds that this kind of social interaction helps create healthy habits for life. 

As local and national initiatives continue, parents are encouraged not only by the experts but also other like-minded people in their communities who understand fitness is more than just exercise - it's a way to cultivate holistic wellbeing among youngsters that includes positive body image, better sleep patterns, focus at school and overall life satisfaction. 

In light of these findings, experts are calling for parents nationwide to encourage physical activity from early childhood as part of an all-inclusive approach towards a healthier future generation with the American Heart Association reporting that children who participate in regular physical activities exhibit improved heart functioning and overall cardiovascular fitness. 

Dr. Thompson adds, "It's never too late to start incorporating more active lifestyles into their lives - as they grow older." Encouraging the parents across different states would help set a nationwide trend for future generations of health-conscious children and adults alike that could have farreaching impact on reducing obesity rates among young people.
