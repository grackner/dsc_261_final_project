In a startling event that has shocked residents and officials across Lagos State in Nigeria, authorities confirmed Tuesday morning at around 07:30 local time the unearthing of what is believed to be an ancient West African slave trade route buried beneath Mile Zero, commonly known as 'Osun Oke'. Archaeologists from the National Museums and Monuments Authority (NMMA) have been excavating at this historically significant site since January 15 when they uncovered a series of artifacts that suggested an extensive trade network.

Experts, including Dr. Amina Abubakar, head archaeologist on the dig team, said "We are inevitably treading upon centuries-old layers as we seek to understand how this intricate web of routes operated." The discovery sheds new light on a part of history that has long been shrouded in mystery but which is vital for understanding Nigeria's past and the transatlantic slave trade’s broader impact.

Lagos State Governor, Babajide Olukoyi remarked at yesterday's press conference stating "This discovery not only enriches our country's historical narrative; it also brings us one step closer to comprehending the scale and intensity of human tragedy that occurred here." A network believed to have been in operation for over 200 years, this trade route facilitated untold suffering before its eventual decline.

The exact age remains undetermined as excavations continue but experts like Dr. Abubakar believe it could date back between the late sixteenth and early eighteenth centuries based on pottery styles commonly used during those periods found alongside recovered goods at various slave dumpsites along this route, including Osun Oke and Olumo Rock in Ijebu Igbo Kingdom among others within modern-day Nigeria.

As for what these unearthed items may reveal about the lives of individuals transported via such routes — their daily routines as well as culture remains yet to be seen through meticulous analysis by specialists like Dr Benson Okoro from University College London who have been invited on site till December 20.

Local residents expressed mixed feelings; while many see this discovery an opportunity for deeper understanding about ancestors, others feel uncomfortable with what it represents - a brutal reminder of their country’s colonial past that they wish to forget rather than confront head-on despite its importance in shaping Nigeria's history today.

Excavations are set to continue into next year but may be reconsidered pending further findings or after consultation with community leaders and historians - decisions which will undoubtedly spark debate among academics, descendants of the enslaved population, as well those whose ancestors were traders in such activities.

Residents who had been waiting for their chance at closure fear that delving into these painful chapters might trigger unresolved emotions or even conflict within families - one which they hope will not be detrimental to community cohesion moving forward as people seek ways of dealing with grief and trauma caused by centuries-old injustices.

In the meant0wness, there's an expectation that this discovery could boost tourism potential for Lagos State - once home base for millions during colonial rule — while providing more material evidence supporting historical claims which have long been denied or minimized but may now finally find a platform amid these significant arch
