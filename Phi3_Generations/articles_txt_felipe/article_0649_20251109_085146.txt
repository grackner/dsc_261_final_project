Topic: Politics - CNN Polls

In a stunning turn of events that could reshape political landscapes across Europe, polls conducted by CNN have revealed significant shifts in public sentiment ahead of upcoming parliamentary elections on May 26th and June 10th in the United Kingdom (UK), Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Netherlands, Denmark, Austria, Portugal, Ireland, Belgium, Sweden, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Slovenia, Slovakia, Greece, Croatia, Latvia and Lithuania. The results indicate a wave of dissatisfaction with the current political climate that has not been seen in decades.

The latest CNN polls show widespinning support for radical changes among voters across these countries - historically staunch defenders of established democracies. With turnout rates expected to break historical highs, a new wave of populism appears set to sweep the continent as young and old alike express discontent with existing political elites, social inequality, economic stagnation, and perceived mismanagement by incumbent governments during crises such as Brexit in UK or COVID-19 pandemic globally.

"Never have I seen a greater sense of urgency among the electorate for substantial changes," says Dr. Sarah Miller, an American political scientist and expert on European politics who closely follows these trends from London's Kings College, where she works as well being director at 'Voices in Europe', a non-partisan think tank that advocates informed voting through polling data analysis.

Several major parties across the continent are jostling for voters’ favor with promises of sweeping reforms to healthcare systems strained by COVID, improved job security and economic prospects after long periods of uncertainty surrounding Brexit or debilitating national strikes in countries like France or Spain. However, experts suggest that while these parties present compelling proposals on the surface, they often lack practical plans for implementation – leading to disillusionment among voters who feel betrayed by broken promises from past administrations across Europe's political spectrums over generations - an echo of US President Donald Trump’s 2016 election win.

Dr James Taylor, a senior lecturer in European Politics at Cambridge University and commentator for The Guardian states that "what we are witnessing is nothing less than the rise of social movements against perceived elitism." These sentiments have gained traction following high-profile protests such as Germany's 'Mordgesundheit', where thousands rallied outside hospitals demanding better patient care amid overwhelming COVID cases, or Portugal’s '#MeDeixaFicar‘ movement that has led to the formation of a grassroots party. 

Pollsters note an increasing trend for 'outside candidates' who are not partisan but offer fresh ideas often based on non-traditional sources such as social media, independent think tanks or youth activists - much like recent US Presidential elections where figures from outside traditional political realms gained prominence. However experts warn that while these movements may bring in new faces and voices into parliaments across Europe they should not overlook the importance of experience if elected to office as some countries have seen unseasoned politicians rise amidst populist outrage only for their lack of expertise to become apparent later on.

The potential consequences are staggering: a radical shift in established political alliances, real
