A local clinic in Los Angeles has become a hotbed of controversy following reports that they have been using outdated medical equipment for routine check-ups and procedures since last fall without notifying patients or regulatory bodies, an investigation by health authorities has revealed today. The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) disclosed the findings after months of covert inspections initiated on July 15 when concerns were raised about patient safety during a routine audit.

"It's unconscionable that any medical facility would put its patients at risk by using equipment that isn't fit for purpose," said Dr. Susan Bennett, director of the CDPH in Los Angeles County. "This has been going on undetected and we demand immediate rectification." The outdated devices were identified as being over 10 years old with some having critical software glitches known to affect diagnosis accuracy by an estimated margin of up to 25%.

Dr. Bennett confirmed that the clinic, St. Mary's Family Health Center at San Fernando Blvd and Pico Boulevard, had received a warning last month but failed to make the necessary changes or communicate with their patients about potential issues during treatments carried out between September and December of 2023. "The lack of communication is not only unprofessional; it's also illegal under California law," Dr. Bennett stressed, emphasizing that such actions could have led to misdiagnosis or even harm without the patients being aware there was a problem with their medical equipment at all.

An estimated 50% of patient appointments conducted over this period were potentially affected by malfunctioning machinery according to preliminary reports from health inspectors, although no direct injuries have been reported thus far as many cases are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic conditions that would not necessarily result in hospitalization. Patients who received treatment during the concerned months and wish to discuss their medical records should be directed towards seeking advice on legal counsel but can confidentially approach St. Mary's Family Health Center directly for clarifications before taking further steps, as advised by Dr. Bennett.

"The situation has caused us great embarrassment," stated the clinic manager Mr. John Davis in a statement released this morning after the publication of these findings with full cooperation from public health authorities to ensure transparency and restore trust amongst its patients. "Our primary concern was always our patient safety, and we deeply regret if any harm has come as result of using outdated equipment." The clinic is currently undergoing a comprehensive audit by external experts who will evaluate the impact on affected patients over the next several weeks with results expected to be published in full within six months.

Patients have reacted with shock and disbelief, many expressing feelings of betrayal after years of trustful relationships developed between them and their doctors at St. Mary's Family Health Center; however, others shared relief that the issue was brought to light before it could cause serious harm or potential lawsuits – "It feels like a massive weight has been lifted off my shoulders now I understand what happened", said one patient while another stated simply: "I had no idea anything was wrong."

The CDPH is considering implementing mandatory regular equipment updates and transparency requirements for all medical facilities in Los Angeles, with the director emphasizing that proactive measures are essential to prevent any future occurrences. Meanwhile, local authorities assure their citizens they will be closely monitoring St. Mary'
