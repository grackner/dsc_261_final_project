A renowned cheese enthusiast from New York City discovered a historic cheddar at an old English country estate in Somerset last weekend that dates back to the mid-1700s according to local historians, marking it as potentially one of England's oldest known private stashes.

Hugh Davenport visited Farthing Down Farm on Saturday after hearing about its rumored collection of antique cheeses through an article in a regional culinary magazine and found himself face-to-face with what might be the world’s eldest commercial dairy product ever recorded, as per experts. The 300kg wheel was unearthed during estate renovations when workers stumbled upon it concealed behind old timber planks in a stone cellar that has housed food supplies for generations of farmers since the farm's establishment centuries ago on February 25, 1748.

“I couldn’t believe my eyes; I mean, to think we had something as ancient and precious as this cheese right under our noses!” exclaimed Davenport after tasting a sample at his restaurant in Manhattan last Tuesday evening where he is set to feature the unique find on special guests' menus. The sommelier added that "this particular wheel of cheddar has such complex flavor profiles—it’s absolutely remarkable."

Cheese historian, Emma Thompson from Bath University who had been invited by Davenport for a sensory analysis praised its robust taste and texture saying it was unlike anything she'd ever tasted before.  "This cheese is like no other; we are talking about something that’s probably centuries old here,” said Thompson while adding, “and yet the flavor profile of this thing hasn’t diminished over time—it remains rich with a sharpness and depth unlike anything I've sampled.”

The find has already drawn international interest from cheese connoisseurs to experts in food preservation as well. Chef Alain Passard, the three-Michelin starred chef at L’Abeille restaurant outside Paris commented on his social media channel that “this discovery is a testament not only about England's rich culinary history but also offers valuable lessons for modern cheese makers regarding aging techniques.”

Farm owner Charles Higgins expressed surprise and delight upon learning the wheel’s age, saying he would have never guessed such an extraordinary find lay in his cellar. “We are very fortunate to come across something so precious,” said Mr. Higgins at Farthing Down Farm yesterday morning where renovation work continues on site after a brief inspection by local historians and cheese experts who declared the cheddar authentic according to traditional aging techniques used in England during that era, with carbon dating tests further confirming its age of over 250 years.

In response, food preservation expert Dr. Sarah Bellows emphasized how significant this find is for understanding historical cheese-making practices across Europe and said “it’s vital we preserve such treasures to maintain links between past culinary traditions and our current gastronomic world.” Experts are planning further research into the estate's storeroom hoping additional unique items may be discovered. 

Following extensive historical documentation, analysis of age-old recipes written in archived farm records dated back to early settlers have been examined by historians and cheese experts who affirm traditional techniques employed during that
