A powerful storm system that has been gathering strength in the Pacific is set to hit Southern California with potential wind speeds reaching up to 80 miles per hour by Tuesday night. Meteorologists warn of possible power outages and falling debris, urging residents to prepare for severe weather conditions ahead of a high-pressure system descending from Canada on Thursday.

The National Weather Service (NWS) has issued several alerts over the past 48 hours as forecasters observed an unusual confluence of atmospherinic phenomena converging into one massive stormfront nearing California' extratropics - a region outside the usual tropical or polar climates. Forecasters had not predicted such a severe event this early in winter, raising concerns amongst meteorologists and Californians alike about what Mother Nature has in store for us next seasonally.

Major wind advisories have been issued across Santa Barbara County, with gusting speeds expected to exceed the 50-mile per hour mark on Sunday afternoon before tapering off as we reach Monday evening - but not without causing significant disruptions along our coastline and beyond due to downed trees limbs and debris.

"I saw one large tree fall across two lanes of traffic during rush hour yesterday," said 34-year old local business owner Michael Rodriguez, recalling the strong winds that had begun taking ahold on Sunday morning near his shop in Los Angeles County's San Pedro neighborhood while tourists from out of town were eager to enjoy their final days here.

Local authorities have also issued flash flood warnings for areas downstream along local waterways within an eight-mile radius around the Santa Ynez River, which officials fear could overflow its banks by early Tuesday morning if heavy rains persist into nightfall as predicted on Sunday and Monday evenings. This forecast follows a weekend of unusually wet weather that has already saturated much more than half our normally dry inland areas from San Diego to Inland Empire with the highest measured precipitation since October 2019 - an anomaly which some climate scientists suggest might be linked to long-term global warming trends.

"It's certainly a stark reminder of how quickly weather systems can turn when we don't expect it," said Dr. Julia Lopez, Associate Professor of Meteorology at the University of Southern California (USC), noting that while Santa Barbara County appears to be spared from flooding for now due largely because its watersheds have been draining since Friday morning as heavy rain battered inland areas and has soaked a swath through parts of San Diego.

"That's all very well, but this is no typical weather event here - we haven’t seen such powerful storm patterns hit before wintertime for decades," said Lopez, adding that the coming weekend will likely see continued heavy rainfall throughout Southern California with an average of 1.3 inches per hour in some areas peaking on Friday evening along our coastline as atmospheric rivers continue to strike from above and below - a rare confluence which has already brought down power lines, trees and other debris across Los Angeles County's diverse topography ranging high-altitude mountain ranges within the 100 or so miles stretched through both counties.
