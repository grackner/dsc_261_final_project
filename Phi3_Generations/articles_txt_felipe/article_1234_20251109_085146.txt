"Severe weather events can lead to these types of occurrences, although it is rare for them to affect such a densely populated urban area," said Dr. Emily Chen, Professor of Earth Science at Sydney University and an expert on coastal erosion phenomena . "It's important that we monitor the situation closely as this sinkhole could potentially grow larger or cause further destabilization."
