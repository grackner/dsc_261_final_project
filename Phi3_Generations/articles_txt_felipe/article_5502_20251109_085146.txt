As election day approaches in New York City on November 8th, campaign officials and concerned citizens alike have been vigilant about maintaining a fair democratic process across all boroughs despite previous security concerns. Mayor Bill de Blasio's administration has emphasized efforts to secure polling locations after the city experienced multiple threats of disruption in past elections.

At 6 am local time on Election Day, officials have reported no incidents at any precinct throughout the five boroughs since their security measures took effect last month. "Our primary goal is always safety for our citizens," said NYPD Commissioner Dermot F. Crowley during a press conference earlier this week to reassure voters and candidates about election day protocols.

In Brooklyn, the district's commissioned campaign manager, Robert Thompson, shared his confidence in security at their polling location stating "Everything seems right with our area today." Meanwhile, officials working within Queens expressed a similar sentiment as Commissioner Michael Collins affirmed that all was well-prepared and secure for this year’th election.

This sense of calm comes after Mayor de Blasio's promise to bolster security measures at the polls following previous years when localized disruinations were reported by witnesses near Times Square, Manhattan; Washington Heights in the Bronx, as well as Astoria and Sunset Park boroughs.

During a press briefing last month, Mayor de Blasio had announced additional security personnel on duty throughout election day stating "No American should ever face undue intimidation when it comes to casting their vote." In his speech at LaGuardia Airport yesterday, the mayor also addressed concerns raised by some independent watchdog groups regarding transparency and fairness of voting processes.

“There are no shortcuts or loopholes in our system; we're committed to ensuring every ballot is counted accurately,” he stated as his team continues its vigilance ahead of the final day which promises a robust turnout among New Yorkers who, for years have been engaged and invested.

The National Election Integrity Association has yet not commented on their latest review conducted by third-party auditors to confirm whether all necessary security measures are in place across each polling station within city limits; results of which they anticipate will be released publicly this week, as the NYC Board of Elections is set to publish precinct reports immediately after polls close at 9 pm local time.

In a recent poll by FairVote New York State Conducted last Wednesday among adult residents who are eligible voters in all five boroughs and conducted across various districts with diverse demographics, preliminary findings showed about an expected turnout of 72% this election season.

“There is nothing more important than making sure every voice counts,” said Democratic Candidate Anne Fletcher during a campaign rally yesterday before the polls closed at her precinct in Harlem where early voting was held last month; “Our citizens must feel safe and confident to exercise their right.” 

In anticipation of election day, security officials have been coordinating with local nonprofits such as 'Voters' Voice’ who are working hard on the ground to help communities prepare for this crucial time. These volunteers assisting in voter education initiatives at various community centres and voting precincts were among those reiterating that "Education is key, not just about casting
