A massive sandstorm in Jordan on Monday disrupted travel across a significant portion of the country as it raged with unprecedented fury for days at a time. The storm, which is believed to have been caused by an intense clash between cold and warm air masses over Israel' enduring years-long conflict, forced thousands from their homes and led authorities in Jordan to declare a state of emergency across several regions on March 15th.

Authorities reported that winds exceeding hurricane force level had reached speeds upwards of 70 mph (113 km/h), with visibility reduced to nearly zero due to the dense cloud cover of blown sand and dust, plunging parts of Jordan into an eerie stillness. The worst-affected areas were in northern regions near Israel where temperatures have been persistently cooler because they are farther north compared to other more southernly locales with milder climates further south towards Egypt's Red Sea coastline and the Levant region, experts say.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a warning on March 14th that an intense sandstorm could affect Jordan from northern to southern parts within hours after temperatures drop considerably lower than usual levels expected during this time of year – around 20 degrees Celsius - but instead dipped down towards sub-zero points which caused the air over Israel and surrounding areas including in northwestern Syria, Lebanon as well.

"This is a very serious situation; our priority now should be ensuring that people remain safe while we assess long term damage to agriculture," said Dr. Ahmad Al Fayez, Minister of Agriculture for Jordan at press conference held today afternoon (March 16th). As many as 30%-40% reduction in crop yield and livestock losses are expected across the country due to this unprecedented natural calamity.

In response, President Reuven Rivlin urged national solidarity during a virtual meeting with government officials today evening (March 16th). "Our thoughts go out not only towards Jordan's citizens but also those affected in neighbouring countries," he said adding that Israel stood ready to offer humanitarian aid if required.

Agricultural experts warn of potential food shortages as the storm continues its path through Jordan, with significant damage already taking place and more likely occurrences forecasted for areas closer towards Amman where vegetables are commonly grown on small family-owned plots rather than large commercial farms due to limited arable land nearer capital city.

Agricultural Ministry representative Nasser Al-Masri stated, "We will continue doing our best under difficult conditions but the full extent of damage won't be known until after this storm passes." He urged residents in affected areas not to return home unless it is deemed safe by officials or local authorities who have checked for possible hazards.

The Jordanian government announced on Monday that more than 70 flights were grounded due to poor visibility, while dozens of highways across the kingdom saw partial closures as a safety precaution against any potential rock falls caused by sandstorm activity within mountainous regions including Petra and Jerash near Amman.

Agricultural Minister Mohammad Al-Khayyal said that authorities would assess damage after the storm passes in an effort to provide accurate numbers of crop loss, livestock losses as well as
