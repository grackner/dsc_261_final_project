Geneva International Conference: Countries of East and Central Africa Come Together to Combat Famine Crisis Spreading Across Regions Amidst Severe Drought Conditions  

July 12, 2023 - GENEVA (CNN) -- Officials from countries in Eastern and Central Africa are convening at the Geneva International Conference this week to discuss urgent measures needed as a famine crisis continues to spread across regions. As many areas face severe drought conditions with little rainfall expected before winter, millions of people throughout East and Central Africa could be facing food shortages soon unless significant aid efforts begin immediately.

This dire situation has drawn the attention of several countries already struggling themselves in their fight against famine: Ethiopia (facing an ongoing humanitarian crisis with 20 million people affected), Somalia, Sudan and South Sudan are among those expected to send representatives attending this conference. International organizations like WFP(World Food Programme)are also set to provide crucial support during these times of need as they have in the past years when faced similar crises:

"The famine crisis we're facing today calls for urgent global action - every minute counts," says Alex Mendez, Deputy Executive Director at WFP. "We must come together to help affected nations before winter arrives." 

Since late June of this year alone when drought hit hardest in Ethiopia and Djibouti resulting from a severe El Niño weather phenomenon; the situation has become increasingly desperate with crops failing at an alarming rate across many communities that depend heavily on rain-fed agriculture for their livelihoods. Add to this, political instability within some nations like Ethiopia's Tigray region creates another layer of complexity when it comes down delivering aid effectively and safely in already unstable areas where violence is still being reported sporadically by local NGOs working on the ground amidst all these hardships.

With over 2 million people displaced from their homes due to conflict or natural disaster within countries like South Sudan, Uganda struggles with large numbers of refugees who have crossed into its territory seeking safety; there's concern for how resources will be managed when trying provide relief simultaneously addressing both needs - internally and externally.

Sources close to the Geneva International Conference tell CNN that discussions underway at this week’s meeting are focused primarily on coordinating humanitarsitarian efforts between governments, non-governmental organizations as well NGO's working directly within nations affected by famine or conflict zones where violence continues unabated despite various attempts made thus far to broker peace and stability over past years. Suggestions include opening temporary aid centers outside active fighting frontlines which would require increased security forces deployed specifically for safe delivery of essential supplies, such as food, water filters/purifiers medical equipment etc.; these operations are planned alongside ongoing negotiations towards establishing ceasefires or humanitarian corridors in conflict-stricken areas.

According to the United Nations Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), upcoming efforts aimed at combating this famine will include a significant increase fundraising campaign targetting governments and global citizens alike; donations have been pouring in from various sources even prioritizing aid delivery to some regions where needs are direest.
