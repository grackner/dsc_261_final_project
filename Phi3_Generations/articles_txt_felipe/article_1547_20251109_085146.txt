In a recent turn of events in Ukraine, tensions have risen as pro-Russian separatists launched attacks on Ukrainian government forces near Mariupol city late Friday evening local time. According to officials from the conflict region and eyewitness accounts gathered by CNN, these escalated assaults mark an unsettling trend in a country already facing significant strife since Russia's invasion began last year.

The separatists have been fighting for greater autonomy or outright independence within Ukraine but their actions often lead to violence against Ukrainian nationals as well as international criticism of the movements themselves, leading some EU officials and observers to call these forces terrorist organizations in a bid to delegitimize them. 

"Innocent civilians caught up in this conflict are paying an unacceptable price," said Olivier Bazylouis, UNICEF Ukraine representative who visited Mariupol with aid workers last month and saw the aftermath of shellings first-hand. "We must do everything we can to minimize civilian suffering."

Aside from local reports coming out each day detailing horrific incidents such as children being separated from their parents or mass casualties in residential areas, separatists are accused by Ukrainian authorities of deliberate attacks on government facilities and infrastructure within the region. 

"We cannot sit idly while these acts continue," said Petro Porozenko, a senior official at Ukraine's Ministry for Temporarily Occupied Territories who has been dealing with separatist issues since before Russia invaded last year when violence began to pick up pace around the country. "The people of Mariupol deserve peace and security as much as anyone else in this troubled region."

Despite attempts at negotiation between Ukraine's government-appointed presidential administration, Russian occupation authorities led by Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov who visited the front lines earlier today. The situation remains volatile with no immediate sign of de-escalation as war chatter increases across Europe following reports from NATO allies that their own troops are being mobilized to prepare for potential military confrontations should peace talks fail and Russia's forces advance further into Ukraine territory before year’s end.

Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko issued a statement this morning emphasizing the city is doing everything in its power as well: "As an elected leader, I have been working tirelessly for peace since day one - that's why my office has launched talks with both sides hoping to find common ground. Despite our best efforts and ongoing discussions between various factions here at home about how we can bring stability back into this city."

The international community continues its response as sanctions against Russia grow bolder, although progress towards a peaceful resolution remains painfully slow according to diplomats who have watched the talks grind toward deadlock. As negotiations stretch well past their intended end date without tangible results or even an official breakthrough announcement yet made public by either side since yesterday's latest meeting in Kyiv, there seems little hope for change anytime soon as tensions continue to simmer at a volatile high within Mariupol and across Ukraine.

In his interview with CNN last weekend, Russian President Vladimir Putin was asked about the future of Russia’s involvement if peace talks fail: "We will assess our position according to how things develop on the ground." The Kremlin chief's response leaves
