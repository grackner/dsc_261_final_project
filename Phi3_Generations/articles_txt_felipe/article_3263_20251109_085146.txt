Topic: Style - Beauty

In a bold move that has sparked conversations across social media platforms and beyond, beauty brand Dove announced last Thursday in New York City its newest line of vegan-friendly cosmetics set to hit shelves on March 1st. Aiming at those conscious about animal welfare yet demand high standards for personal care products, the 'Pure Style' collection has been carefully curated by a team that includes dermatologists and environmental experts to meet both ethical beauty needs as well as stringent quality requirements.

Dove CEO Sarah Simmons believes this new venture will open up an unprecedented market segment for her company: "We see a growing demographic of consumers who value vegan options without compromise on their skin health or style," she said in an interview last week, adding that the R&D team spent six months developing 'Pure Style.'

The collection consists of 20 unique products, including foundations, blushes, and lipsticks. What sets them apart is Dove's use of synthetic biology to develop vegan alternatives without relying on common animal-derived ingredinents like beeswax or lanolin that often compromise both cruelty concerns as well as the effectiveness in skin application products, according to a recent press release.

"Our customers told us they wanted cosmetics free from any kind of exploitation," commented Emily Chu, Senior Product Developer for Dove's vegan lineup and who has been with the company since 2015 when it first ventured into cruelty-free products. "We heard them loud and clear."

During a tour last week to see how 'Pure Style’ ingredients are sourced, Chu shared that one of their synthetic biology partners is an internationally recognized startup based in California named BioBeauty Inc., specializing in creating plant-based compounds designed with the same properties as traditional animal products.

"The vegan market has been growing rapidly and it’s important for all beauty brands to consider this shift," said Dr. Helen Foster, Dermatologist based at JFK University Hospital who was also on site last week during a press event. "Products like these are critical in providing quality choices that don't harm animals or the environment."

As demand grows for cruelty-free and vegan beauty products, 'Pure Style' is poised to make an impact within weeks of its release with Dove aiming at 25% market share by year end. With a significant social media presence on platforms like Instagram where nearly half (47%) of millennials prefer cruelty-free and vegan products, according to the last Nielsen report from August '19 – companies are starting realize they need options for these consumers or risk losing them in droves.

"The market is shifting," Chu continued during an interview at Dove headquarters just after its announcement of ‘Pure Style.’ "We're proud to be one step ahead."
