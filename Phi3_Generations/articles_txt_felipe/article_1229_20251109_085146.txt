Amidst a growing concern for screen time reduction among children, major networks across America are taking proactive steps to address this issue within their programming slate. In an unprecedented move backed by pediatric health experts and educators alike, all leading television channels have announced the introduction of 'Educational Hours', dedicating prime time screen-time specifically for children under 12 during weekdays starting from next Monday.

Sources close to industry negotiations confirmed that this initiative will allow kids between Sunday and Thursday nights a healthy dose of educational content as alternatives to unrestricted television watching or excessive use on digital devices, which has been linked with several negative cognitive outcomes in young children.

The announcement comes after the American Pediatric Association (APA) released new findings last month suggesting that heavy screen time is detrherent for brain development and overall wellbeing of growing kids. As part of this proactive step, television networks are working on curating content featuring educational material from trusted sources with age-appropriate language as recommended by experts such as Dr. Susan Greenfield who stated: "Ensuring our children consume quality learning during their prime screen time can enhance cognitive abilities."

Moreover, in a bid to maximize the positive impact of this initiative on young minds nationwide, major broadcasting networks are collaborating with top-tier educational institutions and child psychologists. These partnerships aim at producing engaging content that not only entertains but also imparts valuable knowledge across various subjects from science to history – all in a way children can easily comprehend.

In response to these changes, National Association of Broadcasters' President and CEO David Donovan commented: "We are very excited about this partnership with educational institutions for producing child-friendly content that will significantly contribute towards the holistic development of our younger generation."

As part of their commitment, leading networks have promised to review programming choices quarterly based on feedback from children and parents alike. This continuous improvement approach intends not only to meet but also surpass the expectations for quality educational television in America's living rooms. 

While reactions among various stakeholders appear largely positive, a leading child psychologist Dr. Tim Keller remarked: "Although this is an important step forward, it needs constant monitoring and refinement to align with evolving children’s learning patterns." Meanwhile, parents across the country expressed relief over their kids getting more constructive screen time as one parent named Julie commented at a local forum in New York saying, “As much as I wanted my son away from screens before bedtime, this new initiative brings peace of mind knowing he's watching something educational."

While the nation eagerly anticipates to see how these 'Educational Hours' unfold over time. Experts urge parents and children alike to maintain open dialogue about screen habits while networks remain committed to delivering engaging, age-appropriate content that nurtures young minds for a brighter future.
