In an unexpected turn of events that has caught market watchers off guard in Asia and Europe yesterday afternoon, major stock indices fell sharply amid escalating trade tensions between the US and China. As investors fear widening impact on global economic growth if a resolution is not reached soon, markets across Tokyo (Japan), Hong Kong, Shanghai (China), Singapore, and Seoul have all reported significant declines by close of business today in New York City time zone.

The US-China trade standoff came to the forefront after President Donald Trump's recent threat to impose new tariffs on Chinese imports if China does not make substantial changes that benefit American workers and farmers, following accusations from both sides over unfair practices in bilateral trading. The S&P 500 plummeted more than two percent yesterday while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped by almost three percent during pre-market activity hours today as markets digest potential implications of an escalating trade war, which could see tariffs increase between $21 billion and $60 billion on Chinese goods imported into America.

"Today's market volatility is a stark reminder that geopolitical issues are directly impacting global economic prospects," says Professor David Robinson from the Economic Research Institute in New York University, who has been studying international trade and its effects for over 20 years. "Investors worldwide should be aware of these potential risks as they make decisions."

Asian markets like Singapore's Straits Times Index has seen its largest single-day decline in almost three years and South Korea’s Kospi 200 lost more than one percent yesterday afternoon while Tokyo Nikkei A50 was down by nearly four percent at close of business this evening, further exacerbating fears that markets will be unable to shake the feeling of a potential recession caused by mounting trade tensions between America and China.

"Market sentiment is driven primarily by investor perceptions about political decisions," says economist Lisa Chen at Harvard University, who has been studying economic policy for over two decades in Asia-Pacific markets specifically relating to its influence on businesses operating within this region."The uncertainty surrounding the US and China's trade negotiations can lead investors into adopting a defensive mindset which could resultantly affect market performance globally," Chen added.

Major banks in Japan such as Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, and the Industrial Bank of Japan have also seen their stock prices decrease by two to three percent today amid growing concerns about how an ongoing trade conflict between America and China could hurt both countries' economies in general. In Hong Kong too, financial institutions like Credit Agricole Asia-Pacific Bank plc (AAA), HSBC
