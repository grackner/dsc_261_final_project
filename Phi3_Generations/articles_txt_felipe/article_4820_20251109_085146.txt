A high-profile celebrity couple faced allegations of intimate partner abuse during a heated custody battle in Los Angeles last weekend. Renowned actor Alex Mercer and his on-screen wife Jamie Luster were arrested when friends heard screaming outside their Beverly Hills home early Sunday morning, reports CNN's local team reporting from the city.

Alex, 35, is known for blockbuster box office hits like "Fist of Justice" and "Galactic Wars." Jamie, his equally talented co-star in both film and music with multiple platinum albums under their belts, has built a devoted fan following as well. The Mercer family had recently been embroiled in a fierce custody dispute over Alex'that toddler daughter after splitting from her mother three months ago due to unspecified differences that allegedly led to emotional distress for the child.

According to friends who braved entering their front door, they found Alex Mercer and Jamie Luster in a screaming match as neighbors tried to alert them of an impending police raid scheduled by Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office on Sunday morning (April 12) for violating domestic disturbance rules. Police arrived shortly after receiving the call, reportedly finding broken furniture and bloodstains inside their residence that led them straight to Mercer and Luster without needing backup from other units or search warrants according to Detective Michael Thompson with local law enforcement's child protection division.

The couple had been sleepover guests at a friend's house over the weekend when alleged confrontations started on Friday night, but their relationship has often attracted media attention because of its high-profile nature as well as Mercer and Luster's individual careers in Hollywood – he is widely admired for his action roles while she garners praise from critics with her evocative singing voice.

When asked about the incident, Alex said through tears during an interview on Good Morning America: "I didn't see this coming and I regret my actions towards Jamie tonight. She is everything to me; our love for each other should be stronger than anything else." He went on to say that he was struggling with stress from the custody battle, which has been causing sleepless nights and impacting his work in film productions since their split three months ago when they divorced child's mother.

Jamie echoed Alex’s sentiment but also mentioned her frustration over Mercer taking out issues on others instead of addressing problems at home, as she stated: "I feel like we both have been putting our careers before the health and happiness of my daughter Amelia during this time; I hope he realizes that what matters most is us being a positive influence in her life."

The LA County Sheriff's Office confirmed domestic disturbance charges, but no physical injuries were reported. However, child protection services have been alerted about the situation as they are due to conduct routine home visits for Amelia Mercer this weekend and take statements from all parties involved in her caretaking during these times according to their website’s guidelines on how to deal with sensitive matters when a family member is under investigation.

This incident has caused an uproar among fans who feel betrayed by the couple's actions, despite understanding that stress and grief following separation may have played factors in Mercer and Luster's behavioral outburst according
