Amid escalating tensions in Asia-Pacific region on November 15th, Beijing announced its decision to launch a new series of military exerclams within disputed maritime zones off the coast of Taiwan and Hainan Island by early next year. The Chinese Ministry of National Defense spokesperson disclosed that these activities are meant for peacekeeping purposes but have raised concerns among regional neighbors who perceive them as a threat to their territorial claims in waters near China’s maritime provinces, according to Xinhua News Agency and state-run Global Times reports.

"This move is not intended towards any particular country," said the spokesperson during an official press conference held yesterday at Beijing's Great Hall of the People after hours of closed talks within Party leadership about national security issues related to maritime affairs, a senior Chinese diplomat told reporters.

But several East Asian nations expressed alarm over China’s intentions and fear these military exercises could provoke conflict in an already volatile region where territorial disputes run deep among claimants like Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Vietnam as well as between them themselves against common foe: North Korean regime.

"We call for all parties to exercise restraint," said a statement issued jointly by foreign ministers of four Southeast Asian nations — Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore during an online meeting hosted on Tuesday morning in Jakarta with ASEAN Secretary General Lim Jong-yen.

Earlier this month South Korea's Ministry for Patriots Affairs issued a warning to China noting that the island nation could respond militarily if Beijing attempts "to illegally advance its claims by force." This followed similar warnings released last summer after Chinese ships rammed and damaged Japanese coast guard vessels.

In an attempt at de-escalation, top leaders from both sides held telephone conversations on November 12th but failed to reach a consensus regarding maritime issues that have been festering for decades — China’s claims of historical rights over islands in the South and East China Seas.

"Our defense is focused only on defending our national sovereig0nty," said General Chang Hee-keun, Chief of Staff at PLA Southern Theater Command yesterday during a briefing outside Beijing’s Zhongnanhai complex attended by military analysts and reporters.

Analysts say the timing is deliberate as President Xi Jinping seeks to shore up support among his hardline supporters ahead of next year's Communist Party Congress, where he hopes to cement control over power structures within the government with no major changes in policy direction expected following four years under his stewardship.

The United States has expressed its growing concern about China’s military activities near Taiwan and said it will continue "to fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows" amidst fear of a potential miscalculation or accident by mistake that could unintentionally spill into warfare between Beijing and Washington.

Senior Pentagon official Lt Col Michael Kelley told reporters on Wednesday before traveling to Seoul, "the US is closely monitoring developments in the South China Sea" amid growing pressure from allies such as Japan who have made clear their determination not back down after a recent ruling by an arbitration panel of the United Nations International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea.
