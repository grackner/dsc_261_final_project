In a startling development on Tuesday evening at Madison Square Garden in New York City, an aspiring basketball player made waves with his exceptional performance during tryouts for the NBA Development League's Brooklyn Nets affiliate team last Thursday night (May 15). At just 17 years old, Jackson Miller from Queens not only impressed scouts and fans alike but broke multiple local junior league records in the process.

Miller dazzled with an array of skills that ranged from remarkable shooting accuracy to impressive defensive maneuvers throughout his three-hour tryout session at MSG—a first for any player under NBA age limits. The standout freshman, who attended Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan and has been playing since the tender age of five years old, reportedly hit a 95% shooting percentage with just six attempts from beyond the arc during his tryouts while exhibiting defensive prowess that led to several notable steals.

"I've never seen such incredible talent at this level before," said one impressed scout who wished to remain anonymous, adding about Miller: "He has a natural basketball IQ and could play professionally right away if he wanted."

Miller’these unprecedented feats have not only earned him immediate interest from local NBA franchises but also caught the attention of national recruiters. After his remarkable display at MSG, professional players like Jayson Tatum reportedly tweeted congratulations to Miller on their Instagram stories and tagged Brooklyn-based teams for potential scouting visits this summer.

"Jackson is a gifted player who could easily become the next big thing in basketball," said an NBA veteran, Mike Connors, known as much for his philanthropy within youth sports initiatives nationwide as for helping propel many young talents to professional stardom during their time at Duke University. "His skills are raw but undeniably impressive and he possesses a work ethic that's truly admirable."

As the story of this extraordinary talent continues, Miller remains focused on honing his craft before deciding whether or not to commit fully to professional basketball in 2023. His remarkable journey stands as an inspiring testament to what dedication and hard work can achieve within one's passion for sports—basketball included.

CNN NBA Analyst, Sam Grant remarked: "I don't think I’ve ever seen a player so young with the ability level Jackson has shown here tonight." His outstanding performance is expected to propel him into national spotlight and he stands as an exciting prospect for many teams looking towards expanding their rosters in 2023.
