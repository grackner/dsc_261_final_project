In a series of coordinated attacks in Iraq's western city of Mosul on Thursday evening, ISIS militants launched assaults against multiple military bases and security posts within the area. The incidents began just before midnight local time as troops conducted routine patrols outside their compounds. Reports from eyewitnesses confirm that a hail of bullets rained down upon at least one base, while gunfire erupted around another location where ISIS fighters were believed to be taking cover nearby an abandoned building complex along the Tigris River's edge in Mosul’s southern outskirts.

At approximately 2:00 AM local time on Thursday when reporters arrived at scene, armed Iraqi forces have been engaged with insurgents holding multiple points across a densely populated residential district not far from the city's central business area since late last night and early this morning. The situation remains tense as skirmishes continue between coalition troops backed by air support versus ISIS fighters hiding amid civilian homes within close proximity to al-Nuri Square, home of a historic statue that became an iconic symbol for the jihadist group before its destruction last month.

"We are doing everything possible here on foot and with our arms," said Brig. Gen Ammar Khalifa Hameedahi, commander of Operation Restoring Hope-Mosul in his office near al-Nuri Square who spoke to CNN by phone shortly after reporters' arrival at the scene around 2:00 AM local time on Thursday morning when fighting still raged. "We continue taking them down one group or another and we try not letting our footprints here but that’s almost impossible."

Hameedahi said coalition forces have encountered heavy resistance from ISIS militants during the assault in Mosul's south, which has been liberated since June 2016. He did not elaborate further on how many insurgents were killed or injured so far this week as his troops fought back with mortars and rockets that struck several targets near residential neighborhoods where civilians lived alongside militants in a complex city of about half-a-million people spread across more than 750 square miles.

Colonel Ahmed Altaf, Iraq’s senior security spokesman who provided details to reporters after leaving his post inside al-Nuri Square for an hour and returning shortly before dawn broke as coalition aircraft continued flying close air support missions overhead above Mosul told CNN the raids began just prior midnight local time Thursday while troops were carrying out a routine sweep along with Iraqi Army soldiers near their base outside mosques around al-Nuri Square.

"It’s very much like being in war," said Lieutenant Ali Ahmad Alnajar, 27 from Mosul who was at the scene assisting forces as an interpreter during patrol operations since late June before accompanying reporters onto one of four military installations where attacks occurred. "Suddenly bullets fly out and I just run."

Alnaraj said he saw firsthand how insurgents had taken up positions on roofs or in sewers leading into old sections below, sometimes from within a civilian house itself as fighting raged with coalition forces trying to clear the militants of Mosul. 

"The resistance they gave us was so heavy that it became impossible for Iraqi
