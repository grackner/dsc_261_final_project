A traveler in New York City was allegedly drugged with a powerful sedative at an airport transit center last Thursday evening near Times Square before flying back to London Heathrow Airport early Saturday morning, according to authorities and local law enforcement agencies. The incident occurred around 6:30 PM on October 15 when Michael Thompson, a businessman traveling from Manhattan for work purposes in the UK's financial hub of Canary Wharf took his usual transit route via LaGuardia Airport (LGA), one of New York City’dependent airports.

Witnesses claim that just after leaving LGA terminal 3, Thompson appeared disoriented and unsteady on the moving sidewalk as he walked to Gate C25A for his Delta Airlines flight back home - a journey usually taking about five minutes in normal circumstances. Airport officials say they were suspicious when it took over ten minutes for him to approach the gate after arriving at LaGuardia, despite being checked-in on time earlier that evening around 4 PM EST via American Airlines from New York's JFK International Airport (JFK).

As Thompson finally reached his departure point in a state of unconsciousness due to an apparent drug overdose - authorities say the only substance found at his person was Ambien, commonly used for sleep disorders and prescribed by doctors as needed. The news comes amid reports that he had been taking several restorative naps since returning from London last Tuesday evening after a business trip with clients due to jet lag - an increasing trend in transit passengers who opted to take sedatives before boarding long-haul flights across time zones, experts say.

"In the past few months alone we've seen at least three such incidents involving people falling asleep or passing out while walking on airport property," shared Captain Sarah Martinez with WABC News after landing in New York earlier this week from Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) - she is a frequent flyer and passenger safety advocate. "We've tried to warn the public about it, but there seems no enough awareness among travelers."

Local NYPD officers were dispatched for Thompson’s arrest after he was found unconscious at Gate C25A when airport security asked him repeatedly if they could help before finally calling medical staff and police. An autopsy report later revealed that the 41-year-old entrepreneur's death occurred shortly after his arrival in New York City from London Heathrow Airport on Saturday morning around noon EST, with Ambien found to be present at a significantly higher concentration than therapeutic levels. His body was discovered lying unresponsive just inside the terminal building near Gate C25A by an airport employee during routine cleaning shortly before 10 AM - after Thompson failed to answer for multiple times he had been called out and his frequent-flying status known throughout security checks prior to boarding at LGA.

"It's tragic that we lost Mr. Thompson, but this kind of incident shouldn’t be happening anymore,” shared John Bauer, an airport spokesperson with LaGuardia Airport (LGA), who added: "Our priority is passenger safety and security for everyone on our property - it must never happen again."
