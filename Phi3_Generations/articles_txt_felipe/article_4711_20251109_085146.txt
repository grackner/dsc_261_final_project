A blowout in college football history occurred this weekend when Alabama trounced LSU with a final score of 64-17 at Tiger Stadium on Saturday night. It was not only the largest victory margin by any Crimson Boll team but also broke previous records held by Ohio State and Oklahoma, both dating back to 2015.

In what could be remembered as one of the most dominant performances in recent times, Alabama'CTO Matt Barnhart led his troops with expertise, while LSU was left struggling for breath on numerous occasions throughout the game. “We were downright outmatched," said a disheartened LSU defensive tackle after being overwhelmed multiple times by Alabama’s offense run primarily through quarterback Mac Jones and running back Bryce Woodchild.

Mac Jones threw five touchdown passes in addition to scoring one himself, while the ground game was equally impressive with players like Chris Warren rushing for 80 yards on just ten carries alone (Warren's statistics). However, LSU’S coach Bill Davis acknowledged that “Alabama has a more versatile and efficient offense." The Tiger Stadium crowd roared as Jones completed yet another touchdown pass to junior wide receiver James Taylor with 1 minute left in the third quarter.

The game came down to these final minutes, where Alabama managed to score two quick points before LSU had even mounted a formidable defense against their passing attack - this was not going well for Louisiana State University (LSU). “We were exhausted and frustrated,” shared assistant coach John McClung.

Alabama's next opponent, Mississippi State, is preparing to visit Tiger Stadium with high hopes of an upset but experts believe it would be a challenge considering Alabama’s record-breaking performance against LSU - 64 points scored while allowing just one touchdown pass (17) from the Tigers' quarterback. With this game being nationally televised, college football enthusiasts across America eagerly anticipate next Saturday as they follow their favorite teams to victory or defeat.

As a result of Alabama’s impressive display against LSU in Tiger Stadium on Saturday night breaking previous records for the largest margin and touchdown passes thrown by Crimson Boll players, many are left wondering what will come next from this exceptional team as they continue their season undefeated so far.

“It looks like Alabama is set to go all the way," says sports analyst Robert Carter after watching tapes of both quarterbacks' playbook - he praises Jones’ precision in delivering high-quality passes and “unbelievable strength” displayed by running back Bryce Woodchild during rushes.

Eagerly awaited next weekend is an away match against Mississippi State, with many fans predicting another dominant performance from the Alabama team should they continue to ride this wave of momentum - it would certainly be a game not soon forgotten in college football history books and among those passionate about the sport on Saturday.
