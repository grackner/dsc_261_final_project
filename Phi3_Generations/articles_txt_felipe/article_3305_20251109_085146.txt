A team of international astronauts conducted an unprecedented exploration on Mars last weekend from NASA'static base camp located in Cape Canaveral, Florida, United States. The crew consisted of six members representing various space agencies including ESA (European Space Agency), Roscosmos (Russian Federal Space Agency) and CNSA (China National Space Administration). Their lander touched down on the Martian surface with no apparent issues last Thursday at 14:02 UTC, just after they had launched from Earth to begin their seven-month journey across space.

During this historic mission dubbed 'Pathfinder,' astronauts set out to explore and study various regions of Mars in greater detail than ever before using a combination of robotics, satellites and human presence on the Martian surface simultaneously. The landers were equipped with advanced scientific instruments designed for analyzing rock formations, soil compositions, atmosphere samples as well tools necessary for living and working conditions during their stay which is set to last up until February next year when they will be making a safe return journey back home via Earth's orbit-based rendezvous system.

"It felt like an incredible experience being able to stand on another world," said NASA astronaut Jessica Meir, one of the crew members who also performed some remote operations from their orbiter above ground during this expedition last Saturday evening when they first saw Mars' atmosphere against its reddish sky as seen through a window in their lander module.

The main goals for Pathfinder were to search out signs indicating past or present life and evaluate potential resources needed by future human colonists, should such an ambitious plan ever come into fruition someday beyond this decade-long period of time when humans first set foot on Mars way back in 2024.

Scientific Director Dr Richard Zubrin from the Planetary Society shared his excitement and confidence over these findings, "This marks a tremendous accomplishment not only for us but humanity as well; we are now able to take another step closer towards achieving long-term sustainability on Mars."

As of this moment since their touchdown back in November at the Jezero Crater which has been identified by past missions such as Curiosity rover's landing site for potential signs of microbial life, results are still pending but initial images show intriguing formations within sediment layers deposited during previous Martian water flow cycles possibly pointing towards historical aquatic ecosystem.

"We plan to conduct more detailed studies on these features using our suite of scientific instruments including spectrometers and cameras next week while keeping an eye out for any signs that may lead us closer towards answering this question about life beyond Earth," stated Dr Zubrin as he expressed optimism during his live interview from mission control at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston last evening.

As the international team continues to execute their ambitious plans and discover new findings each day, more people across our blue planet are looking forward with anticipation on how these developments could bring us closer towards transforming Mars into humanity's second home one-day soon or maybe not even so far away.
