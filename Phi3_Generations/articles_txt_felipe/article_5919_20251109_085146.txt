In a recent development on Asian soil that sends shockwaves across continents and oceans alike, an international team of researchers has announced what could be considered one of the most significant archaeological finds in modern history: The ancient city believed to have been built by Emperor Qin Shi Huang's workers more than 20 centuries ago. Uncovered during excavations near Xi'an, China on March 15th this year, experts now believe that they may hold the keys to understanding early Chinese civilization in a way previously not possible through written records alone; an astonishing revelation given Qin Shi Huang’s legendary quest for immortality.

"This is by far one of our most important finds yet," said Professor Li Wei, lead archaeologist at the site near Xi'an where workers unearthed walls estimated to be over 20 feet high and several miles long, along with an abundance of artifacts from around 513 BC.

According to witnesses present on-site during excavations led by Li Wei’s team, life inside this ancient city was unlike anything imaginable before; a bustling hub surrounded by extensive agricultural fields and farmland outside the fortifications suggest that Emperor Qin Shi Huang' extradition would have required robust provisions.

Li Yue, one of several volunteers helping with digging unearthed an intricately crafted golden chariot bearing inscriptions on its sides believed to belong to high-ranking officials within the city: "This discovery brings history alive for us; we feel privileged." The artifacts found in this ancient encampment are expected to be transferred carefully into a preservation facility where they will continue their examination.

The find has been hailed as an unprecedented leap forward by historians worldwide, with significant implications not just for understanding early Chinese society but also regarding human evolution and development at large; the layout of this city suggests it had organized infrastructure long before other cities known to have existed globally.

"Such a discovery changes our perspective on ancient civilizations," said Dr James Hutton from London’s Imperial College who is assisting with carbon dating techniques, as he examined some organic material found at the excavation site: "It speaks volumes about how advanced these societies were."

The project leaders anticipate that they will be able to offer more concrete conclusions once several key tests are conducted in their preservation facility and a fuller exploration of this remarkable find is completed. The global archaeological community remains on high alert for further revelations as excavation work continues with increasing intensity; the world holds its breath, waiting eagerly to learn what secrets lie buried beneath layers of history within these ancient walls that once echoed with life and now whisper tales from centuries past through silent stones.
