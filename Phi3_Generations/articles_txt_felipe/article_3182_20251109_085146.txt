NYC Artists Rally for More Public Funding Amid Budget Cuts | CNN Politics

New York City's vibrant arts scene continues to struggle as city officials reveal plans for significant budget cuts in the coming fiscal year, which could impact funding programs supporting public art across boroughs. The Metropolitan Museum of Art announced last week that it has received 23% less in government grants than anticipated based on projections from November last year.

The news comes as artists and advocacy groups have been calling for increased support to maintain the city'self-image as an international art capital since Mayor Bill de Blasio took office two years ago, starting with a $20 million initiative aimed at commissioning new public works by local designers.

"We were promised continued investment in our cultural institutions and arts programs to sustain the city's identity through unique contributions," said Maria Vasquez, president of Artists United NY (AUY). "But now we see that support is fading."

Cuts expected across all five boroughs mean several prominent public art installations risk closure without immediate intervention. The Brooklyn Bridge pedestrian pathway currently adorned with interactive light sculptures by artist Jane Lee will no longer be maintained, sparking outcry from the local community and businesses that rely on its tourist draw.

De Blasio's office has not issued a statement yet; however, city councilman Peter Tedesco told reporters he expects to propose legislation urging for more public arts funding as an essential part of NYC infrastructure in the coming weeks. He warned that failure to act now will permanently harm New York's reputation around the world: "Art has always been a vital component in defining who we are and how others perceive us."

AUY plans rallies throughout Manhattan next weekend where organizers hope for not only direct appeals but also public signatures on petitions addressed to City Hall, Mayor's office as well as the Governor of New York. AUY officials estimate over 50 events are being organized by local community groups nationwide aiming at increasing awareness about this pressing issue among other artists and cultural enthusiasts alike while garnering support for a city-sponsored task force examining arts funding policies in detail before presentations made to the public officials.

"Art is New York," says Tedesco, who adds that he hopes these efforts will bring back more substantial federal investment into NYC art programs: "Without it; we risk losing our identity and place as a world-class cultural hub."
