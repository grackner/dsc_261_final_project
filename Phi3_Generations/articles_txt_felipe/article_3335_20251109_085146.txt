British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Wednesday that he is stepping down as Conservative Party leader and expected a general election within months to address concerns over Brexit negotiations with the European Union (EU). The decision shocked many, including former prime minister Theresa May who had been seen leading talks in an attempt to forge consensus on how best to proceed.

Johnson's announcement came just hours after he failed to push through his Brexit deal during a crucial vote that could send the UK back into internal political turmoent and uncertainty, with fears of delaying or even canceling an election overshadowing efforts in Parliament. The plan proposed by Johnson had been criticized as too lenient towards EU citizens working within the UK post-Brexit because it lacked clear restrictions on their employment rights compared to those for British nationals – a key issue among hardline Brexiteers who feel that migrant workers have taken unfair advantage of cheap labour.

"I respect my colleagues in Parliament and understand why they oppose the deal we agreed upon but after this vote, I believe now is not the time to try anew," Johnson told reporters outside Downing Street at around 9 am local time on Wednesday morning with May standing beside him for support.

Johnson insisted that he would remain committed until a new leader was elected while expressing his disappointment over lack of progress made since the snap election in December, which left Johnson's Conservatives leading but unable to secure Parliamentary majority needed by then on Brexit-related matters as Labour held more seats.

"The time has come for us all - including myself and Theresa May now backed down from their previous stance following defeat – we must accept responsibility for what failed in this attempt, focus energy elsewhere such as finding a better future without the EU while maintaining strong ties," said Johnson later at his press conference after he bowed out of political life ahead of elections that many are expecting to be held within six weeks.

Some experts believe there could still more trouble before British Parliamentary procedures have resolved this highly divisive issue, which may lead the government under May's leadership not only facing a deadlock but even collapse with potential resignation or dismissal depending on how things unfold in coming days and months ahead of general elections. Sources close to Johnson say he is prepared for such scenarios as his main concern remains securing a Brexit deal that aligns closely with the wishes expressed by millions who voted Leave last June, despite facing opposition from Tory hardliners within their own party over fears about immigration and loss of workers' rights.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn responded in Parliament yesterday saying he will not stand for elections if his demands are met regarding sovereignty concerns but would rather focus on bringing down the government by using parliamentary mechanisms such as filibustering or obstructing its agenda-setting plans. He accused Johnson of being "out of touch" with public sentiment and warned he won't hesitate to vote against any Tory policies that do not respect democracy, including Brexit arrangements:

Corbyn said during a session in the House of Commons yesterday afternoon where no progress was made on amending Johnson's deal after another round of votes failed yet again with Labour refusing concessions over immigration controls. "We will fight back against this reckless and divisive leadership," he asserted, adding that if his party won power
