A shocking incident took place at yesterday's Little League World Series game in South Williamsport when a powerful swing by pitcher Jake Morrison shattered a window on the nearby Riverfront Stadium stand and injured spectator Mr. Carlson, age seven from Reading Pennsylvania (MLB Today). The 12-year-old batter hit for an inside-the-park home run against the local team representing Shelton Township in Lansing County at approximately 3:05 PM during Sunday's third game of group play on August 9th.

"Jake is a remarkable young pitcher, and this was certainly not his intention," said Coach Sarah Mitchell regarding her son Jake Morrison after the incident (CNN Little League). "He has always played with great passion but within controlled limits." The coach added that she couldn't help feeling there should have been additional safety measures in place.

Mr. Carlson, a regular attendee of baseball games for his son and grandchildren who are avid fans too, was standing near the edge where Jake hit when he got injured by flying debris from broken glass (DailyMail). "I couldn't believe my eyes as I saw shards coming towards me. It happened so fast," said Mr. Carlson after regaining consciousness in a local hospital following emergency treatment for his injuries, which included cuts to both legs and face stitches required on the right cheek (CNN Little League).

The incident has sparked concerns amongst parents about their children's safety at stadiums hosting youth games. A representative from National Kids Baseball said that incidents like these are a reminder for all involved in youth baseball to prioritize player and spectator safety, especially when dealing with aggressive players or pitchers (CNN Little League).

The local league office has promised an investigation into the incident after consulting legal counsel. Meanwhile, fans continue attending games while expressing caution over standing near areas of potential danger caused by intense play on the field and possible broken glass from stray balls hitting spectators above (DailyMail).
