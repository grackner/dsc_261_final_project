In a surprising turn of events at last night's NHL game between Boston Bruins and Los Angeles Kings in California, Toronto-born forward Connor McAvoy was sent off for the first time during his career as he tripped on an opponent near their own net resulting in three minutes being called against him. The incident occurred just before intermission with 23 seconds remaining when fans could sense tension rising high among Bruins' players who had been playing a defensive game to secure victory over the Kings, known for their offense-focused tactics under coach Mike Sullivan’this season.

"I felt terrible about it," said McAvoy after his teammates were seen comforting him on the ice as they walked off together towards bench with a huddle of Bruins staffers, including assistant general manager Don Leblanc and head coach Brad Marchand present in their stands. "It was an unfortunate mistake."

Former player turned analyst Ted Satorius chimed in during pregame broadcasts about this unexpected game-changer for both teams before intermission; he had highlighted the Bruins' tendency to rely heavily on a physical style of play throughout his commentary. "We know that Connor has been trying hard all season, but today is just too much," added Leblanc during postgame coverage as they tried their best efforts towards defusing any potential animosity between McAvoy and the Kings' players ahead of next game in two weeks time which will see both teams back at home territories again.

The Kings jumped straight to attacking with 16 seconds left, but Boston tightened things up by holding their ground for another five minutes before losing just one defender near net-empty zone while attempting an illegal check on opposing player John Smith (not real name). Bruins captain Charlie Coyle then took the opportunity presented from breakaway to make a pass leading directly into empty space where McAvoy received his first shot of frustration since redcard moment.

Hockey reporter Samantha Nguyen who attended tonight's live event in Los Angeles shared her observations while watching closely; she noted how both teams had played it smart so far keeping score balanced at 1-1 after each goal being equalized quickly within one minute time limit per team. "The atmosphere is electric as we head into halftime and beyond," remarked Nguyen, who felt the intensity between fans of these two iconic franchises was unmatched in recent years with both sides eager to see what unfolds next on ice during critical back-to-back game situations where players' stamina could really test their mettle against tough competition ahead.

In addition to interruption from redshirt, officials had also imposed an infraction for delay of play due mainly caused by Boston fan Johnny Doe who tried throwing away his beer cup during ejection ceremony which led fans reacting with boos when referee Mark Johnson brought them back into action 30 seconds later announcing another three-minute major penalty will commence against him immediately.

The Los Angeles Kings have been a top contender this season, currently leading Western Conference after outscoring their opponents in each game so far played except for one match where they ended up losing by goalie Mike Green's last save which turned around fortunes of the opposing team from behind closing gap with just minutes left on clock during regular season play until now as both franchises prepare to face off again head-to-head soon enough after this incident
