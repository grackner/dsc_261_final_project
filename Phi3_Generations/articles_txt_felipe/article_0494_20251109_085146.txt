In a striking development in financial markets worldwide today, tech giant OrionTech announced that its recent acquisition of smaller competitor NebulaData for $750 million has been called off due to regulatory concerns and failed valuation expectations during negotiations with the European Union. The deal was slated to close last month in London but fell apart when EU officials cited competition laws, fearing a monopoly could form if OrionTech's market share continued on its present trajectory after absorbing NebulaData’ end of July 2031 sale deadline.

Sources familiar with the situation told CNN that despite initial optimism from both sides and promises of innovation in cloud computing, discrepancies arose during due diligence procedures involving financial audits conducted by international accounting firm Smith & Co., resulting in OrionTech having to backtrack on its acquisition plans.

"This was a high-stakes deal for all parties involved," said Jane Doe, Chief Financial Officer at OrionTech headquarters located near Oxford Street. "We were hopeful about driving change and expanding our presence in the EU market but had to reassess after multiple rounds of meetings with regulatory officials."

Investors across Europe reacted negatively today as shares dropped by 7% on major stock exchanges, according to Bloomberg. Experts speculate that a failure this high-profile deal could send shockwaves through the tech sector and might prompt other firms thinking about expansion into EU markets to proceed with caution in their negotiations moving forward.

The CEO of OrionTech did not comment directly on today's announcement but assured employees that he is confidently optimistic about future plans, asserting: "We will keep our eyes fixed on the horizon and find new opportunities."
