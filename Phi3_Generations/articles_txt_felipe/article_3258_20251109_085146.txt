A high school football star from East High in Atlanta has taken his talents to college with a remarkable track record at prestigious universities across the nation since he was just out of sophinflife and local youth leagues. Elijah Turner, born on May 4th, '98, made history when he became only the second student-athlete from East High in four decades to earn a national college football title by playing as an offensive lineman for Georgia Tech's historic team last season.

Turner arrived at Atlanta’s premier academic institution with big shoes to fill and immediately showed promise, joining his older brother who had also played on the varsity squad during high school years in 2015-'16 before transferring due to family reasons. The talented offensive guard started playing as a true freshman at Georgia Tech after spending time with different local clubs and gaining experience through summer camps focused exclusively on football skills development for promising young athletes like himself from the Southern region of Atlanta suburbia, known here simply as “the Oval.”

“It’s not every day that a player comes out of East High carrying such potential,” said Coach John Doe after Turner's first game against rivals UGA. "He brings heart and soul to our team." Since then he has become an essential piece in Tech’s impressive defense, winning him recognition from the college community as well as major scouts attending tryouts nationwide throughout spring break semesters of his sophomore year (2016).

Several years after earning a national title with Georgia Tech's offensive line during 2016-'17, Turner transferred to LSU for the start of this season as an upperclassman and returned last fall. He made headlines again when he was selected by ESPN’s College Game Buff in their preseason All-SEC team at left guard/tackle after demonstrating exceptional blocking skills with consistency over multiple games, especially those against SEC foes like Alabama or Ole Miss that year (2019).

Turner's commitment to excellence is not just on the field where he has an impressive 3.8 GPA in his mechanical engineering degree program while playing for LSU’s Tigers under legendary coach Skip Holtman, but also off of it as part of a leadership group mentoring younger athletes entering high school football programs across Atlanta and its surrounding areas on life skills beyond academics—an initiative he proudly launched last year called "Turner's Playbook."

"I just want to give back what was given me by my parents, coaches, teammates - anything that helped make it possible for this dream come true,” Turner shared with the Atlanta Daily Journal after hosting a workshop at East High yesterday (April 28th). "It’s not about football anymore in my heart. It's about impacting lives."

The next chapter of Elijah Turner's career remains unwritten, as his decision whether to continue playing for LSU or transferring elsewhere comes after the fall semester concludes with a final tally on national rankings and potential draft prospect lists by April 20th (4/19). Experts believe there is no doubt that whichever institution Turner chooses next, he will remain an influential figure for years to come as both accomplished athlete and dedicated mentor.
