An investigative report has unveiled a massive market manipulation scheme involving major players in global oil markets that dates back to early this year and continues through today's trading activities on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX). The scandal, which involves officials from countries across Asia, Europe, North America, Latin America, and OPEC nations, disrupts current energy strategies worldwide. 

Authorities in multiple jurisdictions launched simultaneous investigations after the Energy Information Administration revealed a record-breaking increase of oil prices by over $20 per barrel within just three months—an occurrence that experts find highly unusual and suspect market manipulation tactics at play behind this sharp surge. 

The New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), where the trading is conducted, has been notified of these allegations with multiple complaints forwarded to their compliance department since April when irregular activities began picking up pace in oil futures market transactions that coincided strangely with geopolitical events. 

"This unprecedented increase goes beyond the expected fluctuation and has significant implications for economies, particularly developing ones heavily dependent on energy imports," said Dr. Michael Hesson of Columbia University's School of International & Public Affairs during a televised press conference last week where he discussed preliminary findings of his team’s research into the matter as an independent international relations analyst and expert in global oil markets. 

According to documents leaked from various national security agencies, including those within OPEC member states such as Saudi Arabia's National Security Agency (NSA), there appears a pattern of coordinated buying on the NYMEX that has not been publicly disclosed before in recent history. Furthermore, suspicions have emerged about unusual trading volumes from several large financial institutions which are known to hold significant oil assets globally and operate at unprecedented levels during certain hours of market operations since mid-February until today's date—a timeframe that coincides with key strategic meetings among world powers. 

Senator John Thompson, chairman for a Congressional Oversight Subcommittee on Energy Markets and Trade, emphasized the gravity of this situation during an interview last Thursday: "What we are witnessing here is not just about greed but potentially endangering lives around the globe if people can no longer afford to heat their homes or fuel for transportation. It's critical that these allegations be thoroughly investigated."

In response, global energy minister Maria Fernandez of Brazil has expressed concern over how this manipulation scheme might influence oil export revenues in her country and called on other OPEC nations as well to stand united against any market abuse. A representative for the United Nations Conference on Trade & Development (UNCTAD) confirmed that they have begun talks with interested parties aiming at creating a transparent mechanism which would monitor unusual trading activity more effectively in order not only bring culprits to justice but also restore trust back into global oil markets after this shock event. 

Officials are still awaiting complete findings from their respective agencies and investigators, yet all parties involved maintain confidentiality due to the sensitivity of these proceedings which carry potential economic repercussions in multiple nations worldwide beyond just commodities prices; however, they do agree that urgent action is needed.
