Davis High School football team suffered a heartbreaking defeat in Saturday night's championship game against Oakwood Prep at Lucas Field. In an upset that took fans and pundits by surprise, the underdog Davis squad fell short to their opponents with just six minutes remaining when they could have tied or won the matchup 24-21 after a controversial play involving offensive lineman Alex Thompson was reviewed for potential holding.


"We thought we had it until that whistle," said coach Mike Larson, reflecting on what many saw as an unjust call against Davis's last drive of the game right before halftime after Oakwood blocked a critical fourth-down snap with two seconds left in regulation time. "The entire team felt like we had earned it."


Davis rallied back into contention following several successful drives, but missed opportunities and an uncharacteristically aggressive first half defense from their opponents sealed the fate for Davis High's star players. Fans in attendance expressed shock at the outcome while many social media accounts were filled with debates over officiating decisions throughout both teams' histories of rivalry dating back two decades to a game that ended 45-32, favoring Oakwood Prep since then.


Oakwood Coach Jennifer Kim commented on the win: "It feels good to be champions for once in over thirty years—this is what it takes hard work and determination." Davis players have expressed their displeasure with several team members speaking out about perceived unfairness during play-calling.


The loss brings a somber end to the season that saw Davis reaching new heights under Larson's leadership, as they had improved from last year when finishing ninth in state rankings and making it only halfway through their conference schedule before pulling out of divisional games due to injuries on multiple occasions.


"I know we fell short this time around but what coaches have done with the team has been impressive," said senior wideout Derek Sanchez, who had 10 catches for just over a touchdown passing yard during regular-season games that saw Davis reaching first place in their conference standings before being upset by top contenders.


Looking ahead to next season and the selection process with regional collegiate recruiters already showing interest despite not making it all the way this year, Larson remains committed: "Every defeat brings lessons but I know we can rise again."
