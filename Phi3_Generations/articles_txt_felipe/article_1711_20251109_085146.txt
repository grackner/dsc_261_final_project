In a record-shattering event that caught many by surprise, San Francisco was hit with an unprecedented snowstorm on December 14th this year. The city saw its first significant snowfall in over two decennial cycles of calm and serene winters since the early days when temperatures regularly dipped below freezing between October to January. What started as a few flakes around midday transformed into an alpine-like scene by evening, blanketing parts of San Francisco with up to 12 inches (30 cm) of snow in some neighborhoods like Bernal Heights and Haight-Ashbury.

Jessica Martin, who was taking a stroll in the Park, said she had never seen such an abrupt weather change before saying that "it felt as though we were living inside one of those Christmas movies." The snow began to fall around 12:30 pm and by sunset attendees on Mission Street found themselves knee-deep.

Weather experts are baffled, with the National Weather Service stating that such an event was as much a "scientific anomaly" as it is meteorologically rare in San Francisco's history, even if mild winter conditions have become more common due to climate change effects on weather patterns. The city had only seen two other snowfall events over the past 40 years with records of just an isolated shower here and there during mid-November or early December which would not accumulate enough for a white Christmas, according to meteorologists at San Francisco Weather Bureau (SFWB).

"These are conditions that we have never seen in our lifetimes," said Dr. Raymond Tung of SFWB's Meteorology Department during an interview on CNN Local News. "We anticipate this weather pattern has a cold front moving from the Pacific Northwest to create these wintry anomalies, but nothing quite like what happened here today."

The snow started with sleet in mid-afternoon hours and turned into heavy flurries before coming down as wet snow after about 6 pm local time. This sudden change of weather left some residents stranded while others had to cancel holiday plans due to the hazardous conditions on roads, sidewalks, and city parks in San Francisco's famously temperate Bay Area climate zone where summertime can regularly exceed a sweltering 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsiies).

The snow accumulation varied by location with Bernal Heights seeing the most at around 18 inches, followed closely behind Haight-Ashbury and Golden Gate Park. The San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency quickly deployed extra buses to keep commuters moving as road conditions worsened following overnight thaws when plows were called in for clearance before another round of snow by a new cold front expected on Saturday evening, December 15th bringing possible additional light accumulation.

Residents and officials alike have urged people to take precautions while venturing outdoors as San Francisco Mayor London Breed declared an emergency in some affected areas saying "We are monitoring this weather situation closely and will continue providing assistance." She also recommended that residents avoid non-essential travel until road conditions improve. 

CNN Local News plans to follow the development of this rare snowfall event over time with further updates as experts work through analyzing its causes, impacts on transportation infrastructure in San Francisco and potential implications for
