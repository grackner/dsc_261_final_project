A powerful earthquake struck near Gaza City in Gaza Strip on March 15 at around 3:20 AM local time with a preliminary magnitude of 6.7 according to the US Geological Survey (USGS). The tremors were felt across several countries, including Israel and Egypt, raising concerns over potential damage caused by this seismic event amid tensions in the region.

The earthquake struck approximately 2 miles below ground near Gaza City'th northwest area of Jabal al-Basha around midnight local time causing extensive property damages reportedly worth billions of dollars, and resulted to at least one confirmed fatality with several others still unaccounted for. According to the Palestinian Civil Defense Department (PCD), a preliminary survey indicates that more than 10 buildings were severely compromised or collapsed entirely in the earthquake-hit areas of Gaza City and Rafah, adding pressure on already strained resources with regards healthcare sector.

An official statement by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas mourned for those lost saying "we will not let our grief overshadow us from standing united to rebuild." However, the immediate aftermath of earthquake highlights how fragile infrastructures in Gaza are amid continuous Israeli-imposed blockades and conflicts with Hamas.

In a briefing earlier today, Dr. Ahmed Qadoura, an expert from Palestine's Bureau for Research & Studies on Natural Hazards (BRSNH) expressed his concerns saying "This event has brought back painful memories of past earthquakes that have struck the Gaza Strip and we need to take this as a serious wake-up call." He added, “We must remember our seismic history – in 2018, an earthquake with almost identical magnitude hit southern region killing doz0zenes. This time around it seems like more buildings are destroyed.”

Egyptian and Israeli officials have started to mobilize resources for relief work despite maintaining their blockades of Gaza - a move that Palestinian representatives criticized, urging them not only to provide immediate assistance but also support in rebuilding efforts post-disaster. The Egyptian Red Crescent has sent several aid convoys towards Rafah via the Allenby Bridge into Israel for relief supplies including tents and blankets while Israeli officials have stated their commitment "to humanitarian needs".

In an exclusive interview, witness Iman Awad spoke about her experience during the earthquake saying: “It was a horrific feeling; we heard noises like warplanes taking off. The tremors were constant and buildings around us started to crack.” She expressed hope that international aid would help in recovery efforts while urging Israeli officials not only for humanitarian support but also assistance regarding rebuilding infrastructures as the blockades have significantly affected Gaza's ability to recover from disaster due.

The UN relief coordinator Aya Admir-Allah underscored that “Humanity should stand together in this difficult time, especially when Palestinians are hit by natural catastrophes and facing political constraints.” She stressed the need for an urgent response adding: "We have to prioritize not only life saving but also long term recovery strategies".
