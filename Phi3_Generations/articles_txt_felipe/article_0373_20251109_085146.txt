In a landmark decision in Lagos on Monday evening local time, Nigeria's federal court has ordered immediate ceasefire negotiations between the rival armed groups causing unrest across the northern states since February of this year. The ruling came as violence continues to claim lives and disrupt daily activities within regions like Kaduna, Adamawa, and Borno states.

The conflict erupted over land rights disputes among various ethnic factions in northeastern Nigeria but quickly escalated into a wider insurgency against the federal government's authority. In response to calls for peace talks made by religious leaders from across affected communities, Attorney General Dahwala-Habila has mandated ceasefire negotiations as per constitutional provisions and national laws that safeguard human rights in Nigeria.

CNN speaks with Professor Adeyemi Ogundipe, a local sociologist who closely monitors the situation: "This is not just about land disputes anymore; it's about identity politics too," he said while discussing developments on Monday evening at his office near University of Lagos. 

"Many feel marginalized because their culture and traditions have been suppressed or diluted over time, thus fuelling animosity against the government." Ogundipe emphasizes that long-standing resentment is exacerbated by economic hardship among disenfranchised youth in these regions. 

Nigerian President Buhari has expressed his support for peace talks and called on all parties to come forward without any prejudice or agenda: "Our primary goal remains the restoration of peace, prosperity, security, democracy," he said during an emergency press conference in Abuja yesterday. 

Buhari's spokesperson Femi Adesina elaborates on President Buhari’s stance: “The federal government is committed to ensuring that the ceasefire holds and negotiations begin without delay, as per directives from our leader."

Nigerian Army Chief of Staff General Gabriel Oyewole has been tasked by his superiors with facilitating dialogue between opposing sides. However, he warns: "It is imperative for all parties involved to approach these negotiations with an open mind and a willingness to compromise."

As the world watches closely from capitals like Abuja - where Nigerian government officials are holding emergency crisis talks today - many fear that political tensions within local communities might derail peace efforts. However, regional religious leaders remain optimistic about achieving lasting resolutions through diplomacy: "We have come too far to go back now," says Sheikh Abubakar Adamu of the Grand Mosque in Kano while hosting negotiations at his prayer hall yesterday afternoon before joining thousands nationwide praying for peace. 

The UN Security Council is set to convene next week with a special session on African conflicts, aimed explicitly towards conflict resolution mechanisms within Nigeria’s troubled regions. While hopeful strides toward reconciliation have been made in prior years following similar crises; this time seems different as several non-governmental organizations are actively working alongside the federal government to promote interfaith dialogue among conflicting parties across northern states before, during and after peace negotiations begin.

The international community has already expressed solidarity with Nigeria in its efforts towards reconciliation - including notable diplomatic figures such as U.
