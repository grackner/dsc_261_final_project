A new television series pilot titled "City of Dreams" is set to debut on Netflix next month. Directed by Emily Harris and produced by renowned production company Warner Bros., the show promises a unique blend of drama, mystery, and fantasy elements with an innovative twist: it unfolds entirely in real-time narration style reminiscent of HBO's "True Detective."


In this exclusive interview segment from last week’s Hollywood ScreenGuard panel discussion held at the Beverly Hilton, director Emily Harris explained that they are taking a daring approach to storytelling. “We want our audience on edge as if real life is happening before their eyes," said Ms. Harris confidently about her creation set in bustling New York City with scenes shot over three months at various iconic locations like Times Square and Central Park.


According to series producer Daniel Greene, "City of Dreams" features an ensemble cast led by seasoned actor Mark Thompson as the enigmatic Detective Jack Rivers portraying a detective's journey through life-altering events that threaten not only his career but personal relationships and mental stability. “The character is complex—at times, readers will feel empathy for him, at others they might find their cynicism mirrored in Detective Jack Rivers," he added during the interview which took place on March 5th.


Initially teased back in May of last year with trailers showcasing raw performances and stunning cinematography by leading director Harris, critics rave that "City of Dreams" delivers an intense narrative experience unlike any other series out there. However, some skepticism remains regarding the format's long-term appeal as audiences navigate through its nonlinear storytelling style—a bold move in television production which could set a new industry trend or fade into obscurity for future projects to follow. 


Moving forward from this premiere, it is anticipated that "City of Dreams" will not only captivate viewers' attention but also spark conversations on the evolution and experimentation in modern television content creation with its ground-breaking format — a real-time narrative journey as experienced through multiple perspectives. The series first season consists of ten episodes, each running for around 50 minutes without any commercial interrusions or recaps to maintain the intensity throughout continuous viewing sessions expected by subscribers on demand via Netflix's streaming service after its February debut next year.
