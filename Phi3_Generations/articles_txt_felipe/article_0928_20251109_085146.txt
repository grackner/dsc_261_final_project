In a move that is reshaping the local tourism landscape, Grand Haven City Council has approved plans for 'The Waterfront Luxury Hotel,' set to open its doors by late 2024 along Lake Michigan'ran shoreline near downtown. Mayor Elizabeth Johnson expressed enthusiasm about this long-awaited addition stating that it will provide a much-needed boost not only in tourism but also in local employment opportunities.

The hotel, which is the brainchild of esteemed hospitality magnate Gregory Hayes, boasts 150 guest rooms along with spacious suites and executive penthouses that are set to become sought-after commodities for business travelers seeking a luxurious escape from their routines.

A local shop owner said she couldn't hide her excitement at the prospect of more guests walking past her seaside café, while an economic analyst predicts robust growth in spending and revenues to fuel job creation not only for hotel employees but also suppliers throughout Grand Haven city-wide. 

A construction company that has been selected by Hayes' team plans on utilizing green building materials with the aim of reducing environmental impact without compromising guest comfort, according to Mayor Johnson who is hoping this eco-friendly approach will set a new standard for resort developments worldwide. The hotel’s grand opening dinner and showcase event at which celebrities are rumored to attend has been scheduled as early as late 2024.

"We're bringing something that not just locals can enjoy but also international tourists," said Johnson, "This project is a testament of Grand Haven’s resilience and commitment towards sustainable development."
