In a groundbredependent series of raids carried out by U.S. forces across multiple Latin American countries on Tuesday evening local time — including Colombia, Mexico, and Peru — more than two dozen suspected drug cartel members were detained in what authorities describe as an unprecedented effort to dismantle transnational criminal networks that have long plagued the region.

The coordinated operations led by Interpol resulted in arrests across a broad spectrum of suspects, some linked with high-profile trafficking cases dating back years — if not decades. 
CNN has reached out to local authorities and cartel representatives for their statements; as yet none have been released officially. The following is based on firsthand accounts from eyewitnesses, law enforcement personnel involved in the raids, intelligence analysts within U.S.-led task forces that orchestrated these actions, and Interpol's publicly-available data about cartel affiliations and activities over recent years across Latin America:

In Colombia, where a large portion of cocaine originates before being processed in Mexico into powdered form for transatlantic distribution, the Colombian National Police (Policía Nacional) arrested dozens suspected individuals at their bases located within major urban centers such as Bogotá and Medellín. "It's a massive operation we have going on here," said Colonel Luis Enrique Ramírez of Colombia’s anti-narcotic division, whose officials worked closely with Colombian intelligence to coordinate the raids through Interpol. “We knew that if left unchecked these networks would continue expanding."

Mexico's Federal Police reported multiple arrests in cities including Mexico City and Tijuana — sites where U.S.-originated heroin is often stored before being smuggled into neighboring countries such as the United States, Colombia, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador; or even Europe for traffickers to exploit with better access points towards Western markets and affluent consumers — all while avoiding drug interdiction by U.S. agents patrolling its southern border near Panama as well as Mexico's northern frontiers that are currently overwhelmed due to the influx of migrants from Central America in search of safety within American shores after decades spent under authoritarian rule and ongoing political turmoil back home (and now, with increasingly desperate hope for human rights reform). 
"We're tackling a growing issue that has international ramifications," said General Rodrigo Alvarez from Mexico’s Department of National Defense. “Not only are these cartels endangering our people and security; they also affect us economically by draining resources through their illegal enterprises."

Peruvian special forces detained several suspects believed to be responsible for drug shipments between South America and Panama, which has become a major transshipment hub since 2016 when President Juan Guaidó proclaimed himself the interim president following political instability in Venezuela — resulting years later with over half-million Venezuelans still displaced amid ongoing civil strife. "We’re seeing new routes emerging as cartels seek alternatives," explained Captain Jorge Sanchez of Peru's specialized anti-narcotic unit, who described how Peruvian law enforcement has been working hard alongside its counterparts in other nations over the years to curb trafficking activity
