In a surprising turn of events at Sunday's NBA game between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Golden State Warriors, star player LeBron James pulled himself out due to an apparent knee injury just minutes into the match in Oracle Arena on December 15th. The sudden loss has left fans and teammates alike shocked and concerned for his wellbeing as he continues to be evaluated by medical staff at St. Mary's Medical Center, where he arrived after exiting mid-game.

"LeBron was in excellent form coming into tonight' endorsement deal worth millions of dollars," says former Laker teammate Chris Mihm who has closely followed the professional player’s career over three decades spanning four different teams and five seasons with Cleveland Cavaliers between 2003-2015. "He was playing like he could compete at any time, this is a big loss to him personally as well."

The Warriors lead the game by double digits in both halves following James' departure from what looked set to be an epic showdown between East Coast and West Coast giants when suddenly with 7 minutes into play officials ruled that he was unable to continue because of his injury. This unexpected exit has sent shockwaves through basketball circles where it’s been speculated by some experts like ESPN analyst Adrian Wojnarowski whether the incident could be indicative or even lead-up towards an early retirement move for James who recently signed a two year extension with Miami Heat until he'll turn 40 next season.

“It’s always been said that these superstars can make it out of any situation but injuries are part of the game and sometimes even inevitable," says Dr. Samantha Lee, an orthopedic surgeon based at St. Mary's Medical Center where James is currently being assessed by doctors specializing in sports medicine including himself."

Despite not playing today’s contest against Golden State Warriors - which he has won twice while with Lakers as MVP – NBA Commissioner Adam Silver stated “It saddens us when a star player gets hurt but they know better than anyone that there are many players who will take their place in the game.”

LeBron's representatives issued an initial statement saying "We respectfully disagree with some of these speculations about retirement. LeBron is currently receiving top-notch medical care and we hope for a speedy return to basketball as soon as possible." The Lakers themselves have been tightlipped on their stance but sources suggest they might opt for an early draft pick or trade in case his absence continues beyond the scheduled 13 weeks.

With LeBron James no longer able to play, Golden State Warriors are leading by a significant margin while Los Angeles Lakers fans nationwide look forward anxiously awaiting word on their star's condition as he undergoes further examinations in front of team physicians specialized exclusively for professional athletes like him.

The NBA has not yet released any official statement but sources confirm regular communication is taking place between commissioner Adam Silver and medical staff regarding potential next steps should LeBron James be unable to return before the end-of-season playoffs scheduled against Miami Heat in mid April after just three quarters of matches played on Saturday night.
