In a startling turn of events in college football's prestigious Bowl Championship Series on Saturday night at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia, LSU Tigers quarterback Jaden Smith threw four interceptions within the first five minutes of play as he tries to lead his team against Alabama Crimson Tide.

Smith struggled throughout the game and finished with a dismal 48 completions out of 120 attempts for just over two yards per attempt, according to statistics gathered by CBS Sportsline. This record-low completion rate marks an even more disappointing end to his promising college career in which he has led LSU to its first three straight SEC East titles since the conference's reorganization in 1992 and threw for a school best of nearly 4,000 yards this season.

"I didn't see anything that gave me confidence," Smith told reporters after halftime at LSU's practice field outside Atlanta yesterday before he was benched early today by head coach Ed Orgeron who decided to go with backup quarterback Brent Milam for the remainder of this game.

According to his official stats on Sports-Reference, Smith completed just 50% (63 out of a possible 126 attempts) in eight quarters against Alabama's top defense and threw an interception every two minutes with none thrown by Crimson Tide signal caller Mac Jones during the first five innings.

"Jaden was really uncomfortable throwing downfield," one LSU offensive coordinator said, who declined to be named as he spoke in private ahead of this game yesterday at Georgia Tech Stadium on a sunny Saturday afternoon for an SEC Championship showdown that has been the talk throughout college football's regular season.

"I had confidence throwing the ball back-shoulder and off his hip, but I didn't like how my eyes played along with those motions," Smith continued as he admitted to getting tunnel vision on occasion when looking downfield toward Alabama wide receiver DeVonta Freeman (84) during last night’s SEC championship game against the Crimson Tide. 

The LSU coaches, who had started prepping their backup quarterback Brent Milam in late October after a devastating first half loss at home to Auburn left Jaden Smith benched for three quarters of that contest and his career ahead uncertain until yesterday's SEC championship game with Alabama began.

"We just couldn’t buy anything," Orgeron said this morning on the sidelines before being forced back out there after Milam struggled too in which he went 6-of-18 for a mere one yard per attempt during his first time as starter yesterday at Georgia Tech Stadium.

"Brendan has been great, but we need more consistency on offense," Orgeron said today before the SEC Championship Game started between Alabama and LSU that was postponed last Friday night due to weather conditions in Atlanta ahead of this week's game against Auburn at Mercedes-Benz Stadium.

Despite a strong defensive performance by Milam, who made several impressive plays during the first five innings before being benched after throwing an interception with 3:40 left in that half and having to run for his life on two occasions while downed behind Bama's punishing defense near LSU’s end zone against Alabama last night
