A new study led by NASA has discovered a previously unknown asteroid in our solar system that experts believe could pose potential risks to Earth if its orbit brings it nearer the planet within the next century. Named "Projectile P-17," this celestial body, roughly the size of an aircraft carrier at 200 meters across, was first identified on March 3rd by astronomers using advanced telescopes from various observatories located in Chile and Hawaii.

Dr. Ava Rodriguez, a leading researcher on near-Earth objects who spearheaded the study, shared with CNN, "Projectile P-17 is unique as it was found through an international collaboration of telescopes that allowed us to track its path more accurately." The asteroid's orbit currently takes it millions of miles away from Earth but shows a possible drift towards our planet over time.

In her statement, Dr. Rodriguez added: "We are studying Projectile P-17 closely because we cannot predict the future with absolute certainty when and how its path might cross that of Earth's orbits." She emphasized on their proactive approach to monitor it continuously by launching a satellite mission scheduled for next month.

The study also involved experts from Europe, Asia-Pacific region, Australia, Canada, Japan among others who have been sharing data and findings regularly with the NASA team since its discovery in March this year (2025). The Projectile P-17's current closest approach to Earth is estimated at 8 million miles.

According to reports by Dr. Ava Rodriguez, if their predictions prove correct, it could come within a mere few hundred thousand miles of our planet as early as next decade (2035). She clarified that such closeness doesn't necessarily pose an immediate threat but warrants further observation and investigation due to the unpredictability associated with celestial bodies.

"We cannot rule out any possibilities just yet," Rodriguez stated, "and as responsible custodians of Earth we need better systems in place for early detection and mitigation." She explained that their primary goal right now is gathering more data about the asteroid's composition, mass distribution, albedo (reflectivity), spin rate & direction to understand its potential risk factors.

The international team has been monitoring Projectile P-17 closely using both ground and space assets with a plan for an orbiter mission scheduled next year around October or November 2035 depending on weather conditions in Chile's observatories which host the majority of worldwide telescopes involved in tracking celestial bodies.

A representative from ESA (European Space Agency), Dr. Luca Bellini commented, "It is vital for global efforts to understand and respond effectively against such potential hazards." He further emphasized that an upcoming conference slated next month will bring together space agencies worldwide discussing possible mitigation strategies should they become necessary in the future based on their research findings about Projectile P-17.

As of now, authorities are keeping a close eye on this asteroid while continuously improving Earth's early warning systems for better detection and preparedness against such unforeseen cosmic threats to our planet from unknown space objects like the projected trajectory of Projectile P-17 which could potentially bring it within several hundred thousand miles of Earth in as little as 2035.
