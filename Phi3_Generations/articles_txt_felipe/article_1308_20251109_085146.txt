NFL Team Drug Scandal Prompts Tough Questioning from Former Players – CNN News Article  
By James Thompson on Monday   

Last night’s NFL game turned into a controversy-ridden spectacle as allegations of performance-enhancing drug use surfaced among several prominent players. The news came to light when investigative journalists unearthly reports linking high school football star John Doe, now playing for the New York Jets and revered by fans across the city at Madison Square Garden on Friday nights during regular season games (September 7, 2 enduring), with an experimental steroid regimen.  

According to insiders who wish to remain anonymous due to fear of retaliation from their team or league officials, John Doe is not the only player implicated in this case; several others on both offense and defense have allegedly been participating as well. This shocking revelation came just days before NFL owners convened at a private meeting with Commissioner Roger Goodell to discuss potential measures regarding drug abuse within professional sports leagues, though the topic is sensitive enough that officials refuse comment without solid evidence beyond reasonable doubt.  

"I always knew there was something different about John Doe on and off of the field," stated one anonymous former teammate who wished only his name not to be mentioned publicly due to potential career implications for himself as well, according to a report in The New York Times released Sunday detailing their conversation. "He'd been drinking heavily every night after games while I chose never to touch alcohol."  
 
A statement issued by Goodell later confirmed that NFL investigators are looking into these allegations and will present findings at the Owners Meeting next weekend; however, sources close to the inquiry have said no formal charges or punishment were decided upon as of yet. Instead, league officials plan a series discussions between coaches from implicated franchises aimed towards maintaining drug-free environments within their respective locker rooms going forward into 2019 season and beyond — though some team members seem more focused on finding out whether they can trust anyone at all in this environment anymore.

In the meantime, sports psychologists have been fielding numerous calls from concerned parents whose children play local tackle football programs across America - noticing an increasing trend towards younger athletes seeking "performance enhancement" and trying to emulate their heroic idols as well; with research suggesting that upwards of 20%-35%* may have used illicit substances in the past year alone amongst high school football players nationwide.  

It remains unclear how these allegations will impact John Doe's career and future prospects within professional sports, but sources close to him suggest he is determined not let anything happen before giving himself one last shot at redemption on home soil here in the Big Apple during Sunday’s showdown against his former college rivals from Yale University this weekend.
 
*As per data published by National Institute of Health Reports: The percentage represents a significant increase since previous studies, which recorded only around 10% prevalence among high school athletes in the early 2010s.
