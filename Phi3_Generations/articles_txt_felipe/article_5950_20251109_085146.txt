As global temperatures continue to rise and climate change impact becomes more evident across different continents, scientists at NASA'th Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York have recently issued a statement warning of an accelerated melting rate in the Greenland ice sheet that could raise sea levels by two feet or higher this century. In their latest research report released on April 15th, they projected not just regional but also global impacts if current emission rates continue unabated.

The headline figures were alarming: The accelerated melting of Greenland' ice sheet is expected to raise sea levels by up to two feet or more this century - a projection that was even bolder than the previous worst-case scenarios envisaged in years past, reports CNN science editor Andrew Freedman. This comes from data collected via NASA’s airborne campaign over Greenland between 2019 and 2020 which observed unprecedented melting during that period with about three billion tons of ice lost each year since then due to warming oceans.

“We are at a critical juncture where global action is needed,” said Dr. Frances Cembrowski, lead author and glaciologist working on the study in New York’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS). “If we continue with business as usual – no major changes to our fossil fuel-based infrastructure - Greenland' ice sheet will contribute significantly more than 2 feet of sea level rise by this century.”

In contrast, if substantial climate action can be implemented over the next decade and worldwide reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are achieved through a transition away from coal power plants towards renewable energy sources like wind or solar farms; it is possible to prevent more than half of that melt. "With immediate global cooperation, we might avoid catastrophic consequences," said Dr Cembrowski added confidently as she highlighted the significance of decisive political action during such crucial times for humanity and Earth’s climate system alike - a sentiment echoed by environmental scientists worldwide who are deeply concerned about this new reality.

The report also indicated that Greenland' ice sheet melt could cause an increase in ocean salinity levels, affecting weather patterns across the globe like El Niño events but with far-reaching and more persistent impacts beyond just raising sea level locally due to warmer water expanding underneath. These changes are already being observed through satellite imagery which shows significant retreat of glaciers on Greenland' ice sheet since records began in 1974, as well studies conducted by other research teams working independently and using different methodologies all agree with the GISS findings – painting a bleak picture if meaningful intervention doesn’t occur sooner rather than later.

Further discussions regarding these critical findings will take place at international climate conferences set to follow soon after their release, where scientists hope for significant progress towards robust global policies on emissions reduction and adaptation strategies in light of such data - as they emphasize that nothing short won't suffice anymore given the urgency conveyed by this latest research from NASA’s Goddard Institute.

In terms of next steps, Dr Cembrowski said: "We need to keep pushing for immediate action and investment in renewable energy sources worldwide alongside more ambitious climate policies that can effectively address these unprecedented changes brought about by human-driven global warming." With
