In a small village nestled in Thailand's heartland known as Ban Klong Pa Yai, tourism has seen an unprecedent boom over the last year following its feature on Discovery Channel's "Ancient Wonders of Asia." The once secluded location is now one of Southeast Asia's most visited places after attracting thousands more visitors compared to previous years.

The picturesque village, situated close to Ayutthaya—the historic capital turned into a UNESCO World Heritage site since 1991 – has quietly become an emblematic escape for travelers seeking authentic experiences far from mainstream tourist spots in the region. Local officials are working tirelessly on infrastructure upgrades, aiming to accommodate this influx without compromising cultural integrity or environmental sustainability.

The village's transformation began when a documentary crew happened upon Ban Klong Pa Yai while scouting for ancient architectural marvels in the area back in 2018—and never looked back since its feature on Discovery Channel’s hit series that garnered millions of viewers. The show followed experts as they unveiled hidden temples, delved into local mythology and cuisine, exploring a living history dating to the Ayutthaya kingdom era (1350-1767 A.D.).

"Ban Klong Pa Yai's appeal lies in its seamless blend of nature with centuries-old Buddhist traditions," says Dr. Somchai Wongrachanakul, a cultural anthropologist who has been studying the village for years and was one of the show’s consultants. “Travelers seeking to immerse themselves rather than merely observe find our way here.”

Since then, international tourist arrival figures have risen by more than 200%, from around 45,000 in 2018 to nearly 137,000 last year. However, this rapid growth has presented challenges that local leaders are working diligently on addressing — such as managing waste and ensuring water availability for both locals and tourists alike during peak seasons between November and February when the monsoon season subsides but temperatures remain warm enough to enjoy outdoor activities.

"Our focus now is balancing accessibility with sustainability," says Deputy Mayor Phawee Panyasakorn, who has led efforts alongside environmental experts hired specifically for this task since early 2019 when Discovery Channel announced their new series about ancient civilizations in Asia. “It’s a delicate balance but necessary to preserve what makes Ban Klong Pa Yai special.”

Phawee added that local authorities are developing educational programs and sustainable tourism initiatives while encouraging visitors, especially repeat guests who became part of the community over time last year, to engage in respectful interactions with villagers. “We want all our newcomers not just watching but also participating whenever possible,” Phawee says emphatically when discussing how locals are welcoming tourists despite initial reservations regarding their rapid arrivals' impact on daily life and traditions within the village of around 2,000 residents.

Several international media outlets have reported that travelers find Ban Klong Pa Yai an authentic slice of Asian history untouched by time or modern development - unlike other destinations
