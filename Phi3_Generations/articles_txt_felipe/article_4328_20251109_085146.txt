Golden Mean School in London Strikes Deal After Years of Dispute Over Teacher Salaries and Working Conditions  

October 12, 2025 – LONDON - The Golden Mean school district has announced a new contract that will resolve ongoing strikes by teachers demanding higher salaries. Negotiations took months to reach an agreement which includes significant pay raises for educators as well improvements in their work environment and student-toacher ratios, following years of disputes with the London Education Authority (LEA).

For nearly five years, thousands of teachers had been on strike demanding better wages that they felt reflected the economic reality. The strikers argued for a salary increase aligned with inflation rates which have consistently outpaced their pay raises during past contracts dating back to 2018 when adjustments were supposedly made every three years, as per standard policy at most UK schools.

"It's not about just wanting more money; it is a matter of fairness and recognition for the work we do," said Sarah Jameson, one teacher who was among those striking last year but now feels relief that negotiations have concluded successfully. "The teachers here are dedicated to their students."

Under the new deal announced on Tuesday, each teacher at Golden Mean schools will receive a 10% salary increase effective November this year with subsequent annual reviews of cost-of-living adjustments set for every two years going forward in line with official governmental guidelines. The agreement also includes provisions that aim to reduce class sizes by hiring additional teaching staff, improving the school infrastructure and providing mental health resources for teachers as well their students within this year's budgetary constraints of £50 million allocated annually across all schools in London’s education district.

Matthew Walsh-Smith, a spokesperson for LEA was quoted saying: "We understand the need to improve conditions but have always been transparent about our limitations due to funding restrictions." He further noted that this agreement represents an investment into quality teaching and learning experiences in London's public schools. 

In addition to these improvements, Golden Mean school will also form a working group comprising teachers, parents, LEA representatives and community members who would be tasked with reviewing the impact of changes implemented over time before moving forward on future demands or proposals brought forth by either side throughout every academic year. 

Reactions to this news are mixed among those directly affected as well other interested parties across London's education scene – while many teachers, parents and students expressed gratitude for ending years-long conflicts that had negatively impacted children’s educational experiences; others remained skeptical about whether these concessions would bring substantial improvements in the quality of teaching or simply settle disputes without addressing core issues. 

A teacher who wishes to remain anonymous said: "This feels like a victory for our voices being heard after all this time, but we will continue monitoring progress and holding LEAs accountable if necessary." Teacher union representatives are currently preparing next steps including celebrating the achievement while continuously advocating on behalf of their members across London's education system. 

A spokesperson for UK Education Secretary noted that he was "proud to have played a role in bringing both parties together around an agreement which prioritises investment into teachers and students." He further stressed the need for constant vigilance when it comes to
