It was a night like any other on the red carpet at Tinseltown's annual Grammy Awards when pop star Taylor Swift accidentally revealed her next big hit single to an audience of eager fans and industry insiders alike during the ceremony last Thursday evening in Los Angeles. The reveal happened just moments before she was set to deliver a surprise performance, leaving attendees speculating about the song'thy upcoming release on social media platforms worldwide as they continue trying to decode Swift's mysterious lyrics and beats from mere hints dropped during her unplanned outburst.

The 32-year-old singer, known for playing with fans through cryptic messages in previous albums, has sparked a global buzz about the song since she first mentioned it at midnight local time on Thursday after hosting an extravagant Hollywood party earlier that night and during her performance of "Aftertaste."

“I told him I’d drop some songs,” said one music industry insider, speaking to CNN reporters. “Now everyone is trying to figure out what they are.” 

Swift first teased the track in a video on Instagram earlier this month with just four words: "Had an awesome night," but did not give any further details as she continued promoting her album, 'Folklore,' worldwide. The song quickly became one of many fan theories circulating online and has been dubbed variously from “Taylor’s Thunderstorm” to Swift's "Piece for Piece."

“It was an accidental leak,” said a representative from Taylor Swift's record label, Big Machine Records. They say the artist did not mean to divulge any specific information and that her next song release is still set as initially announced on Friday at midnight local time in Nashville, Tennessee where she currently resides between Los Angeles performances of 'Folklore.'

“I want my music to tell a story,” Swift told the audience during last night's performance. “And sometimes that takes us places we never expected.” 

Inside sources close to her have also alluded in past interviews about how she loves keeping fans on their toes with surprises and unexpected turns, saying this could very well be another one of them as the Grammy red carpet event continued beyond Swift's performance. Some attendees recall feeling a sense of trepidation knowing they may not have been fully in control when attending her special events given previous experiences.

“I just thought it was Taylor being playful,” said an anonymous fan, as the artist wrapped up with one final note from "Aftertaste." “We always know to expect something unexpected and that's part of what makes this woman amazing.” 

With fans still trying to piece together clues after last night’s performance at The Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles County — some speculate it could even be her next studio album, while others believe the song will serve as a bridge between 'Folklore' and upcoming work of hers yet unveiled— industry insiders stress that whatever Swift plans to release is safe for listening with no further details disclosed. For now fans are just left speculating about what she might share next on her social media platforms while waiting eagerly until the official announcement rolls around Friday night local time in Nashville, Tennessee at midnight when a second album teased last year will be released as well by Big Machine Records and Taylor Swift Inc.
