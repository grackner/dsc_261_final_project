March 20th is International Day of Happiness and it seems like a fitting day to shine a light on what truly brings joy into people'in lives: relationships. A recent study conducted in Los Angeles, the heartland for love stories with nearly two million inhabitants according to the latest census data, suggests that maintaining quality interpersonal connections significantly enhances happiness levels and mental wellbeing among residents across various demographics.

Researchers from UCLA's School of Public Health surveyed over 150 individuals between ages 20-60 during different times of the day in diverse settings ranging from coffee shops to parks, asking them about their relationship status and perceived levels of happiness. "There is a strong correlation that people who have supportive relationships tend to be more content with life," shared Dr. Maria Gomez, an assistant professor leading this study along with her team over the past six months in Los Angeles County alone.

Their findings align closely with other studies on well-being and social connections worldwide. In fact, as per a 2018 Harvard University report that found similar results across continents from North America to Asia – happy couples tended to be those who shared daily routines or at least open communication lines about their feelings.

“This is no secret - there's scientific evidence outlining the positive impact of strong social bonds on our overall mental health,” noted Dr. Robert Harris, a clinical psychologist working closely with these researchers in Los Angeles County for three years now to assist patients and offer advice based upon their findings; he adds that maintaining such connections is vital during times when physical closeness might not always be possible due to circumstances like the ongoing global pandemic.

Inspired by this growing body of evidence, community organizations in Los Angeles have started organizing regular social activities for local residents including "Bring Your Friends Day" where people are invited together with their loved ones over a day-long series of events offering entertainment while promoting healthy relationships among participants. 

“It’s not just about celebrating International Day Of Happiness, but also using it as an opportunity to encourage and remind ourselves the importance of fostering strong bonds,” shared Emily Thompson, one such event organizer from LA Neighborhood Partnership (LANP). LANP's initiative has already garnered positive responses with approximately 30% increase in participation compared to last year.

As we head towards a brighter future on the path of rebuilding post-pandemic life, these findings reinforce what many have always known: love and support from our relationships play an integral part not only for happiness but also overall healthy living – something which should remain at core even as cities continue to evolve over time.
