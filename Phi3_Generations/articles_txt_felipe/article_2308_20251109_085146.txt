After years of planning, a luxurious new hotel set to open its doors in downttermore by May is now just weeks away from launching an experience that promises to redefine the local lodging scene. The Grande Dulce Deluxe Hotel will feature over 200 guest rooms with en-suite bathrooms and modern amenities, along with a range of on-site facilities including a swimming pool, gym, spa, and fine dining restaurant serving continental cuisine prepared by world-class chefs. The hotel's first room will go up for reservation starting next week, offering visitors an opportunity to preview the establishment before its grand opening later this month as part of their stay in Texas.

Owners Mark Thompson and Emily Lee are confident that with a total investment of $35 million over five years — including land acquisition costs amounting to around $12 million alone—the hotel will not only cater well to the local clientele but also attract international guests drawn by its unique design and sustainable approach. The building itself, designed in collaboration with world-famous architect John Kramer known for his work on eco-lodges around the globe, has been praised as a masterpiece of contemporary hospitality architecture that blends seamlessly into the natural beauty of Delmarva's shoreline.

"The goal was to create an intimate and relaxing atmosphere where guests could truly disconnect from their everyday lives," said Emily Lee, co-owner and executive chef at Grande Dulce deluxe hotel. "We want people who stay with us not just as customers but also companions in a tranquil escape that allows them to recharge."

The Grand Deluxe Hotel's design will include an energy-efficient system using solar panels, geothermal heating and cooling systems, rainwater harvesting for landscaping purposes while minimizing its ecological footprint. The hotel has already received approval from local authorities after extensive negotiations with environmental experts regarding preserving the nearby wetlands that serve as a habitat to several endangered bird species which inhabit the area year-round—some of them listed on both state and federal lists for protection due to their rare status in North America.

"Our design takes into account these precious creatures while maintaining an atmosphere that meets our guests' needs," added Thompson, who also emphasized safety measures implemented during construction such as proper fencing around the wetlands perimeter of hotel grounds with minimal disturbance activities being conducted outside working hours to further prevent any negative impact on local fauna and flora.

The team behind Grande Dulce Deluxe Hotel has already secured partnerships with nearby resorts, tour operators and cultural attractions like beaches and historical sites which guests can easily access through shuttle services that run throughout the day starting from 7am until midnight daily as part of their comprehensive concierge experience.

Guests will have an opportunity to enjoy a luxurious stay while indulging in local flavors at the hotel's restaurant, Casa del Mar featuring seafood specialties sourced sustainably within Delmarva waters—a perfect complement to its sun-soaked terrace offering spectac0ular views overlooking Dulce Lake where guests can unwind.

Grande Dulce Deluxe Hotel also plans on hosting a range of events throughout the year including wine tastings, concerts and comedy night
