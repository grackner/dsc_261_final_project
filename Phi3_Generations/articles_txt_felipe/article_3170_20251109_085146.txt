In a groundbrein recent study published in Nature magazine on Friday, scientists have developed an innovative desalination process that significantly reduces energy consumption by as much as 30% compared to traditional methods such as reverse osmosis and multi-stage flash distillation techniques. This new method of extracting fresh water from saltwater sources has been successfully tested in pilot studies conducted near the Pacific coastline, where access to clean drinkable water is a pressing concern due to increasing drought conditions exacerbated by climate change.

The research team at California Institute for Environmental Research (CIER) consists of chemists and environmental scientists who have spent years perfecting their technique that uses solar energy harnessed via photovoltaic cells coupled with a unique chemical separation process, allowing the desalination to occur efficiently even under cloudy skies. The project started last year when CIER researchers were awarded a grant by National Science Foundation for developing an affordable and sustainable alternative water source that could help communities suffering from periodic shortages in freshwater supply around coastlines like Monterey Bay Area, San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles County as well as other parts of the world.

Dr Emily Harris, lead scientist at CIER who has worked on similar desalination projects before said: "We've seen a growing need for alternative water sources in many communities across coastlines due to rising sea levels that affect salinity and availability - we hope our new method will help alleviate this problem."

According to the study, while conventional reverse osmosis plants consume an estimated 30-50 kWh of electricity per cubic meter produced for treating saltwater, CIER's system requires just as little as only around ten percent more energy due to its advanced solar integration. The research team has also found a way to remove the most harmful chemical compounds like bromide and boron from saline water during desalination process which was previously considered challenging using conventional methods that often resulted in higher costs or incomplete removal of these contaminants causing environmental concerns as well due its potential impact on marine life.

The pilot study conducted at the Monterey Bay Research Station involved testing their system with a daily intake capacity around 25,000 gallons per day using saltwater pumped directly from local sources and fed into an array of solar panels that power energy-efficient electrochemical cells. The desalinated water was then tested for purity to ensure it met or exceeds the World Health Organization's standards before being piped through a newly constructed distribution network towards nearby communities such as Monterey County, where accessibility and affordability of clean drinking water is becoming increasingly difficult due heavy reliance on imported bottled waters.

While this innovative technique has shown promising results so far, further studies need to be conducted before it can become widely adopted in areas beyond the pilot project location as researchers aim for large-scale implementation across regions that face similar freshwater scarcity concerns caused by climate change and other factors such as population growth or industry demands.

Mary Williams, a local environmentalist from Monterey County says: "I am very impressed with this new technology - it seems like we may have found our solution to some of the water challenges facing my community." She added that she hopes government and private sector partnerships can help fund further testing as well as public education campaigns about sustainable practices such as rainwater harvesting for future resilience.
