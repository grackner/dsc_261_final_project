CNN's entertainment correspondent brings to light concerns regarding diversity and representation on popular television series "Golden Age." Despite efforts by producers at HBO in Los Angeles to create an inclusive environment following backlash, statistics from the last season reveal a disheartening pattern. According to recent data, characters of color were given less than 20% screen time and minority writers constituted only about 15% of credited writing roles despite making up nearly half of the population in major urban areas where these series are set.

"The representation we've seen is not reflective of America as it truly stands," lamented cultural critic Jameson Clark, who has been vocal on social media regarding TV diversity issues for years. "Viewers deserve to see themselves reflected authentically in the stories they watch." 

CNN spoke with several fans and experts about their experiences while watching this beloved series. One viewer named Mariah Anderson shared her disappointment, stating, "It's important that shows represent all walthy of society so everyone can relate to what they are seeing on screen.” Another fan, Eric Ramos expressed his frustration saying, “I felt like I wasn’t seen as a part of the story when my character was barely mentioned or acknowledged."

The HBO executives have yet to publically address these issues directly. According to sources within their inner circle who requested anonymity due to fears about potential backlash, they are aware that significant improvements can be made in diversity and representation on set but lack a concrete plan of action as such endeavors often meet with budgetary constraints or creative disagreements amongst team members. 

As concerns grow among the show's fan base — many expressing their worries via online forums and social media platforms, fans are now demanding change from HBO executives while hoping that television will become more inclusive in its storytelling techniques to represent all types of Americans fairly across diverse TV series.
