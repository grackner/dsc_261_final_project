Washington D.C., USA – A massive earthquake struck Japan on Tuesday evening with a magnitude of 7.4, causing significant damage and prompting an international humanitarian response from the United States and other allies in Asia. The tremor was centered near Tokyo around 6:30 PM local time (Tokyo Standard Time).

Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan issued a statement saying, "We have always known that natural disasters can strike at any moment; however, we are determined to rebuild our nation." The death toll has risen steadily since the quake struck early Tuesday morning with over 40 fatalities confirmed.

The aftershock sequence continues as local authorities try to assess and deal with widespread devastation that includes collapsed buildings, cracked roads, disrupted power supply in Tokyo's metropolitan area which affect around four million people – marking one of the most extensive blackouts recorded within a major city.

"We are working round-the-clock to restore essential services and reconnect communities," said Masanori Yamaguchi, an official from Japan’s Disaster Management Agency in Tokyo via press conference yesterday afternoon. 

The American Red Cross has mobilized over $5 million dollars for relief efforts thus far while the United Nations estimates that upwards of one hundred thousand people may be homeless as a result of this disaster with hundreds more displaced and forced to seek temporary shelter, primarily in local schools across Japan’s most affected regions.

As international concern grows over potential nuclear fallout due to damaged facilities near Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant – which was heavily impacted by the quake itself months ago during a devastating tsunami - U.S Secretary of State Hillary Clinton commented, "Our priority is on ensuring safety for people across Japan and preventing any radioactive contams from affecting American soil."

Experts warn that while immediate relief efforts are critical right now they will need to continue far beyond this initial phase given the magnitude of damage. International aid groups like Save The Children stress a long-term commitment, saying in an official statement yesterday afternoon: "Our aim is not only emergency response but also working towards sustainable development for affected communities.”

As countries worldwide offer their support – both materially and with manpower - there are hopes that this disaster will serve as a wake-up call to global society about the importance of climate change mitigation measures. In Tokyo yesterday evening, one earthquake survivor shared her experience saying simply: "We must do better for ourselves before we can help others."

As Japan struggles with recovery efforts from this catastrophic event and international aid pours in to assist the devastated regions around Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, there is cautious optimism amidst heartache. One thing remains clear; humanity's resilience has never been tested more than it now stands before this formidable challenge from Mother Nature herself.

The story will continue as the world watches closely on how Japan navigates through rebuilding and recovery while also ensuring safety protocol measures are robustly implemented to mitigate similar occurrences in future times of need, marking an unprecedented test for both a nation known globally not just economically but culturally.
