A powerful earthquake struck Japan on Tuesday evening with a preliminary magnitude of 7.5 as per initial reports from seismologists monitoring activity along the Pacific Ring of Fire where tectonic plates meet and cause frequent quakes in Asia's most populous nation, Tokyo. Residents felt tremors rippling through buildings at approximately 6:30 PM local time with significant damage to infrastructure reported across multiple cities including Yokohama near Osaka and Nagoya closer to Kyoto.

"We have seen more collapsed bridges than structures damaged by falling debris," says Chief Engineer Hiroshi Ishida of the National Disaster Management Agency as emergency services scramble in response with over 10,00 active teams on ground working around-the-clock to restore normalcy.

Felt across an estimated area reaching up to two million people spreading out from its epicenter near Chiba prefecture about a hundred miles east of Tokyo where authorities declare it the worst quake in decades affecting most densely populated areas due largely as building code has not kept pace with seismological developments.

"The intensity and duration were beyond our models' predictions," shares Earthquake Specialist Dr Emily Roberts from California Institute for Seismic Studies who adds "Infrastructure damage is disconcertingly high, likely because these buildings haven't been designed or retrofitted to withstand such seismic forces."

Initial estimates peg the quake at around 7.5 on the Richter scale - a significant jump from recent mild tremors Japan has experienced over past months but not surprising given this part of Earthquake-prone world where powerful undersea volcanic activity adds to risk factor along tectonic plate boundaries known for intense seismicity with aftershocks anticipated as per geophysical data.

Emergency services have been dispatched immediately but relief efforts could take days amidst reports of road blockages and disrupted air travel due not only because physical damage limits access points within the affected zones, further complicated by a spate of ongoing rain showers dampening work progress across multiple sites simultaneously. 

Tokyo Fire Department Spokesman Tomohiro Nishikawa comments "Our primary focus remains life-saving actions at this stage but we understand how critical it is for people's livelihood too hence our efforts towards swift restoration." Reports from international aid organizations point to millions already in affected areas receiving immediate food and water supplies with additional assistance expected once main transport routes cleared; Tokyo has committed an initial $2 million worth of emergency relief equipment but calls mounting globally demand more substantial help alongside expertise sharing on effective quake response mechanisms.

The Japan Meteorological Agency's Chief Executive Takeshi Nakamura emphasizes caution in public communications as they continue assessments to monitor any additional tremors before providing updates later tonight after which communities will be guided accordingly based upon further data analysis and recommendations from specialists like Dr Roberts. As of now, all available resources are being mobilized while authorities encourage evacuees still unable return home awaiting clearance along with maintaining vigil against potential secondary hazards such as landslides triggered by rainfall amidst concerns expressed over long-term implications on local economies already grappling through recessionary pressures.

In the aftermath of this quake, questions loom large
