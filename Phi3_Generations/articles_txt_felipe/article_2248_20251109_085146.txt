In Mali's capital city of Bamako on Saturday, President Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta pledged to end years of political turmoin and civil unrest by holding fresh democratic elections within six months. The announcement followed three days of national dialogue sessions aimed at reconciling Mali's deeply divided society after a 2019 military coup that upended the country’s transition towards civilians rule, amid escalating violence from jihadist groups and regional instability.

President Keïta emphasized his commitment to "restoring hope for our people," saying in an emotional nationwide address: “I am ready to shoulder this responsibility.” He added that the country’s future would be decided not by force but through democratic dialogue and compromise, asserting he is determined.

“We cannot achieve national unity without a genuine political transition,” Moussa Ag Hamidou, spokesperson for National Advisory Council of civilians said in Bamako following Keïta's speech to the media-covered conference hall where they were speaking with leaders representing 14 opposition parties.

The announcement came after three days’ talks that saw representatives from government, security forces and civil society discuss Mali’s political future while also dealing with concerns of jihadist threats in central African nations such as Burkina Faso, the Sahel region including Nigeria's northeastern Edo State.

Keïta has faced criticism for his role during two military coups and a 2019 seizure by soldiers backed by fellow ex-president Bah Ndaw that put Mali on an unstable path in recent years, including the rise of extremist violence since then which claimed thousands of lives.

The president’s decision has come after months of dialogue between his government and 14 opposition parties who had called for Keïta to step down over allegations ranging from corruption within state institutions to electoral fraud that marred the March elections in favor a then untested former prime minister, Soumaila Cissé.

The announcement was cheered by many Malians at home and abroad but also raised questions about whether Keïta has learned his lesson after three decades of serving as president since 2013 with little political progress for citizens in the country on issues like poverty, corruption or health. Opposition parties that boycotted talks called back to parliament today and vowed not negotiate again without Keïta's exit from office until his term ends next year when he is constitutionally barred from standing for re-election.

Cissé was elected as the new President of Mali after dialogues with military leaders in charge led by former Prime Minister retired General Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta and current Defense chief Colonel Assimi Goita, who took over power following a coup on 18 August last year. But Cissé only assumed office at the end September amid pressure from Western countries including France to have an interim leader before holding new elections in February next year after securing backing by some opposition groups that had boycotted earlier talks with Keïta's government, saying it was biased and unrepresentative.
