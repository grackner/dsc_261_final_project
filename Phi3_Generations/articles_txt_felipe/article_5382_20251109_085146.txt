A devastating heatwave has gripped Death Valley National Park in California since early July, with temperatures soaring to a scorching 130°F on June 28th and persisting for an unprecedented three weeks straight. The relentless sun shows no signs of relief as park officials urge visitors not to underestimate the dangers posed by this extreme weather event, which is expected to continue well into August with potentially life-thinning temperatures at its peak on July 24th and again on August 7th.

Death Valley National Park has been no stranger to record-breaking heat in recent years but the current surge is particularly concerning for park management and local communities, given that Death Valley sees an average of about 1 million visitors annually during its warm season between May and October (National Park Service). While typically only half a percent reach this extreme), over the last three weeks these figures have climbed to nearly one-tenth.

During our interview with Dr. Samantha Hayes, an ecologist specializing in climate change impacts on national parks for 15 years (National Science Foundation) states that "Climate models predict hotter and drier summers becoming the norm across many parts of America due to global warming," emphasizing how these extremities are no longer anomalies but expected occurrences.

The park's superintendent, Eric Thompson says, “We never want someone’s experience with us here at Death Valley National Park being marred by illness or tragedy as a result of this heatwave," underscoring the need for awareness and preparation among those visiting. According to him: "The park now requires visitors to be prepared, carry water supplies in case they overheat due to sun exposure."

Despite these precautions, an increase in medical incidents has been reported by park officials since the beginning of July with 20 heat-related emergencies compared to last year’s total for all of July (Death Valley National Park Health Service). This situation is a stark reminder that as temperatures climb, human health can suffer alongside nature.

CNN has reached out to park management and local communities regarding next steps in combating the effects on tourism and public safety while also ensuring visitor education around heat-related risks continues within this beloved American landmark with its treacherous yet breathtaking landscape.
