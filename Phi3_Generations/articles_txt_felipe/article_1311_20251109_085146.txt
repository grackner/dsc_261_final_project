Topic: Tech - Innovative Cities

In a groundbrethy announcement on Tuesday morning, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms revealed her city is taking significant steps to transform itself into an innovative technology hub in the United States through strategic partnerships and investments worth billions of dollars over the next five years. The initiative was unveiled at a high-profile press conference held at Atlanta City Hall, with Mayor Bottoms emphasizing how this endeavor could potentially create thousands of jobs while fostering cutting-edge research in artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain technology, and sustainable urban development practices.

"With our strategic location connecting the East Coast to Southeast Asia, we want Atlanta not only as a destination for major companies but also an incubator where innovation thrives," Mayor Bottoms explained during her address that was streamed live across various social media platforms nationwide and internationally.

Atlanta's ambitious plan comes in the wake of growing competition from other cities, with San Francisco leading AI research due to its proximity to Silicon Valley; New York being an unparalleled financial center for blockchain applications related investments; while Boston remains a major educational hub where tech innovators are trained. Atlanta seeks not only to compete but also complement these giants in the technology sector, aiming at becoming one of America's most livable and sustainable metropolises centered around technological advancement as per Mayor Bottoms’ vision for 2035.

CNN has reached out to Atlanta city officials for comment on their ambitious plans but have yet to receive a response by the time of writing. This initiative could signal significant changes in how modern cities position themselves and capitalize on technology growth, with Atlanta eagerly aiming at making this dream into reality amidst global economic uncertainties caused by recent tech sector tremors.

"We have always been home to some truly remarkable innovators," said Dr. Aaron Thompson, a professor of Urban Innovation and Technology at Georgia Tech University who was present in the audience during Mayor Bottoms' speech but not officially affiliated with her administration or city council. "This plan is an exciting prospect as Atlanta has been historically diverse both culturally and economically - it can only help to attract a wide array of talent, ideas, businesses for our region."

As the Mayor’s initiative begins its implementation phase this spring, several technology firms have already shown interest in expanding their operations into or setting up new offices within Atlanta. The tech titan Microsoft announced last year that it will be investing an estimated $2 billion to establish a 'Microsoft Research & Development Campus' located at the heart of downtown metro area, which was expected to generate over 400 jobs in various technical and managerial roles upon completion by late next summer.

Furthermore, Atlanta’s plan includes an educational component aimed to develop a highly skilled local workforce ready for emerging tech industries. The Mayor announced that the city's public schools will receive additional funding specifically earmarked towards integrating technology into curriculum from elementary through high school levels by 2024, alongside various partnerships with colleges and universities across Atlanta to provide specialized training programs in AI-related fields.

In an exclusive interview yesterday afternoon, CEO of the tech startup 'Bridgespace', one potential partner that has shown interest in this endeavor, stated:
