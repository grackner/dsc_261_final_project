As of May 15th, a massive earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 7.8 has struck close to Xi'an in central China’de Province Shaanxi at approximately 3:45 PM local time (09:45 UTC). The tremors were felt hundreds of kilometers away and have led to widespread panic, multiple casualties, injuries, and significant property damage. According to the preliminary reports from disaster response teams dispatched by Chinese authorities, over 20 lives are feared lost as they continue their tireless rescue efforts across devastated communities near Xi'an city center.

In a statement yesterday evening, Shaanxi Provincial Emergency Management Head Wu Haihua lamented the situation and urged calm among residents while his team worked on search-and-rescue missions amidst aftershocks that shook buildings in affected areas intermittently throughout this past week.

"The tremor was most powerful during its first strike yesterday afternoon but has since diminished, though we are still experiencing several mild jolts," Wu said while standing alongside the provincial government's disaster relief coordinator Li Yue at one of Xi'an’s hardest-hit sites.

Residents and evacuees from collapsed buildings in a makeshift refugee camp for displaced survivors are being temporarily relocated to new emergency shelters, including several donated hotels close by where food supplies have been running low despite ongoing relief efforts from international aid groups who continue delivering vital resources amidst continued aftershocks.

"Our people need help," local mayor Chen Wei stated today during an emotional press conference held in Xi'an’s city hall with national leaders, the media and survivors present as he appealed for more domestic financial assistance while thanking international NGOs already on site amidst continued aftershock warnings.

A senior seismologist from Beijing University who has been monitoring tremor activity closely explained that this earthquake was caused by a rupture in the Sanhuan fault line, an underwater geological formation which is 30km wide and extends for approximately 45km southwest of Xi'an city. "Such events are not unusual here due to proximity with Shaanxi’s complex tectonic plate boundaries," said Dr Tan Ling from Beijing University during a press briefing yesterday afternoon before heading back out on the field for further measurements and analysis while local officials ramped up disaster preparations.

Official estimates of infrastructure damage range into billions, with some areas reported as being completely destroyed; yet it is still too soon to determine final losses accurately due to continuing aftershocks complicating assessments across vast affected regions which include Xi'an and the nearby city region known locally for its coal mining industry.

"The ground shook so strongly yesterday afternoon that I couldn’t stand up straight in my living room," said Zhang Wei, a survivor who lost his home but not yet friends or family members to this devastating disaster as he waited alongside other evacuees at one of the temporary emergency shelters set-up by national authorities and international NGOs working together.

In response, provincial governor Liu Qi pledged an initial ¥1 billion (US$157 million) in immediate aid
