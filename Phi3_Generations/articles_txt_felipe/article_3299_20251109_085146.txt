A major transport strike in Barcelona has brought international travel into question for millions of tourists this summer season. Hundreds of flights have been delayed or canceled across Europe due to the disruption caused by thousands of protesters occupying airports and train stations since Wednesday night, according to official announcries from Air France-KLM group representatives on Thursday morning (local time).

As tensions continue over a disputed tax hike for transport workers proposed last month in the Catalonian city - which is an autonomous region with its own government within Spain -- passengers and tourists can expect delays, as well short-term disruptions to several international routes leading out of Barcelona El Prat Airport.

Barcelona Tourism has reported that upwards of 6 million visitors are expected in the city through July alone - many looking forward to spontaneous adventures with last minute plans already set into motion by travel agents, airlines and local tour operators eager for business amidst a booming year due largely to pent-up demand from years of COVID lockdowns.

The strike affecting thousands working in Barcelona's public transportation system has since started at 9 PM (local time) when protesters first arrived outside the regional government building and have maintained their presence, blocking roads leading into central business districts until further notice; while some are staying on-site or dispersed to other parts of Catalonia.

"We understand that this disruption is incredibly frustrating for both tourists as wells locals - who rely heavily upon public transport systems in our daily lives here -- but we stand by the belief that no action taken should harm those already affected by economic struggles they've endured during these past difficult years," said Jaume Lluïsa, regional minister of Industry and Tourism for Catalonia.

In Barcelona El Prat Airport alone, which serves as a gateway to millions from across Europe annually - including over 5 million international arrivals in July last year; authorities are working with airlines on alternative transportation methods like shuttle buses or taxis -- however those numbers will only make up the fraction of lost flights.

While no official announcement has been made yet regarding flight rescheduling, Air France-KLM representatives have said their main priority is ensuring passengers are safe and informed as soon as possible; while they note that safety protocols for transportation continue to adhere even during the strike with strict guidelines.

"It's an unfortunate situation affecting our industry, however it remains a necessary step in order for Catalonia workers deserve fair treatment," said Luis Manuel Rodriguez from Air France-KLM who oversees operations throughout Europe (and has been directly involved through years of negotiations with the strikers).

Meanwhile locals and Barcelona residents are left to adjust their plans as well. For many, a crucial part in Catalonia's economy comes from tourism - but now struggling due to lacking visitors amid COVID concerns which have only worsened by this strike; while others continue with businesses unaffected like the nearby La Rambla Market -- located just steps away form El Prat Airport and frequented daily by locals.
