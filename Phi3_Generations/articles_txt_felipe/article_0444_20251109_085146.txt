In a shocking discovery on Tuesday evening in Jakarta, Indonesia'in bustling capital city, authorities found an undetonated explosive device carefully hidden inside the foundation of a three-story office building at Jalan Semarang No.123 around 4 p.m., reports CNN Asia Network citing sources close to the case.

The discovery was made by local workers during routine maintenance when they stumbled upon an old, corroded pipe that led them directly underneath where a small explosion occurred about two hours prior on Tuesday afternoon at approximately 2:30 p.m., according to statements from several witnesses and building security personnel interviewed today by the network's reporters in Jakarta.

Jakarta Mayor Hendrik Pandu, speaking with journalists this morning, stated that while no injuries have been reported so far as a result of Tuesday afternoon’s event, he is concerned about similar incidents happening more frequently and urges city officials to address the situation immediately: “This terrifying incident sends chills down my spine. I want our authorities working on finding out who left this deadly trap in such an unconventional place.”

Another witness, office employee Fajar Sarihasti said she was cleaning some gutters when her workers heard a loud bang from the basement around 2:30 p.m.: “It sounded like something crashed down below but we didn’t pay much attention as it happened in an isolated area of our building.” She added that after hearing strange noises for about five minutes, she and her colleagues decided to investigate further only realizing what they had stumbled upon when one coworker pulled out a corroding pipe: “We were so relieved nobody got hurt but we’re now understand the severity of finding such an explosive device within our building.”

The bomb technicians arrived on scene shortly after 3 p.m., and declared that they believe this to be remnants from World War II, which according their expertise are extremely rare in modern-day urban centers like Jakarta given the current age of demilitarization worldwide since end of Cold War: “While we don’t know exactly who left it here or what purpose would have been behind hiding this device within a building that doesn't appear to hold any strategic importance today, our primary goal now is ensuring public safety by removing and neutralizing the threat.”

As officials continue their investigation into Tuesday afternoon's mysterious explosion which authorities say had no specific trigger but was perhaps an accident caused as people carried out repairs on damaged pipes inside of Jalan Semarang No.123, city residents have been left with mixed emotions about what occurred and how often it might happen again: “I hope this is a one-off event rather than something that happens more frequently but overall I am relieved nobody was seriously injured,” said business owner Ahmad Rasyidullah who lives in the adjacent street to Jalan Semarang No.123 which usually sees busy traffic during peak hours, and today had been quieter due to event taking place within office building: “I’m sure there are some questions about how this happened but it’s important that authorities investigate what exactly caused Tuesday's explosion.”

As of now Jakarta Police Chief Agus Salahudin stated while they continue their investigation, he assures the public everyone at
