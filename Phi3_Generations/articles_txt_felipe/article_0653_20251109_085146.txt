In a thrilling regional championship soccer match played yesterday at Al-Madina Stadium in Riyadh on March 3rd, Jordanian team FC Pro Wadi Rum faced off against their Saudi Arabia counterpart Zamalek SC Yemen with over two hours to go. The decisive moment came when Jamal al-Hazzaa scored a spectaccurate header from an assist by Omar Saeed just before halftime, putting FC Pro Wadi Rum in the lead 1-0 at the break after ninety minutes of intense play and extra time that extended well into early morning.

Jamal al-Hazzaa's goal was a defining moment for Jordanian soccer on foreign soil as he capitalized skillfully from Omar Saeed's pass during an overwhelmingly contested final third of the match, according to FC Pro Wadi Rum’s coach Hassan Basma. “This win is not just about victory; it speaks volumes for our team spirit and unity,” added Coach Khalid Abdel-Salam following his side's triumph over Zamalek SC Yemen after extra time that ended 1-0 in favor of FC Pro Wadi Rum at around 4:30 AM local time.

Jordanian national soccer federation president Yousef al-Touqaily reflected on the win and expressed confidence for his team's upcoming international games, “The boys dug deep today—they played with heart.” Al-Touqaily acknowledged FC Pro Wadi Rum’s exceptional performance against Zamalek SC Yemen as a significant step towards their participation in worldwide tournaments.

Amidst celebrations of the match outcome and shared hopes for greater recognition, fans and officials alike called on national soccer bodies to address infrastructure disparities between domestic clubs across different regions within Jordan that could impede team competitiveness against established Saudi Arabian leagues. The victorious FC Pro Wadi Rum's performance has now set the stage for their next challenge as they prepare to face an Egyptian club in a preliminary qualifier on April 5th, where coach Khalid Abdel-Salam and his team will aim to establish themselves firmly within soccer’s international arena.
