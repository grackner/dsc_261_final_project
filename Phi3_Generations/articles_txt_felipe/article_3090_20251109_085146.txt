In New York City's exclusive Upper East Side neighborhood, a luxurious yacht party celebrating St. Patrick’ran evening has turned into an investigation following reports of missing jewelry and artwork valued in the millions. Happening on Thursday night at about 7:00 PM aboard Sovereign Glory, one of New York's fanciest private vessels anchored near Central Park Lake Marina, guests have been shocked as two pieces worth $3 million and over a hundred smaller items vanish.

The yacht had hosted an invite-only gathering for high society figures in the city to enjoy their annual St. Patrick’s Day festivities on water with gourmet food from Michelin-starred chefs, live jazz music by local entertainers, and a display of rare vintage wines. While revelry was at its peak around 10:30 PM when the missing items were first noticed, no one aboard can provide concrete details about what transpired next.

Detective Inspector Michael Reilly from NYPD Harbor's Special Crimes Unit arrived on site early Friday morning to assess the situation as reported by two guests who claimed they saw a figure sneaking into an unlocked storage compartment while nobody was looking last night after-party attendee, Emily St. Clair said she heard some suspicious noises around 1:00 AM near where her necklace and watch were kept in the yacht's master stateroom but didn’t investigate further until today due to fear of causing panic among guests already reeling from news about missing valuables, St. Clair said.

Officials say there might have been an internal thief who had access not only during social events on board the yacht or elsewhere at marina but also when staff would bring in supplies for service providers and entertainers to perform their shows; however they are still investigating all possible angles, Reilly noted.

In interviews with other guests today (Friday), several individuals who were present during nighttime hours mentioned hearing footsteps down below decks but not seeing anyone out of the ordinary or stepping inside an empty storage space where jewelry boxes and art frames are usually kept in plain sight at daylight. "I remember feeling a draft when I was reading by candlelight on my balcony, which is uncommon for this yacht because they have well-insulated rooms; maybe the thief got through an open hatch?" suggested guest Richard Kensington speaking to reporters after being interviewed by authorities.

Known affluent neighborhoods like Central Park Lake Marina are often associated with luxury lifestyles, yet crime can occasionally occur despite precautionary measures taken by residents and business owners alike; such incidents remind communities of the importance to remain vigilant while enjoying life's finer things. Experts in private security emphasize that even exclusive events require heightened awareness from all guests, whether they are invited or not: "It is crucial for individuals attending high-end gatherings like these yacht parties to keep an eye on their surr_premium belongings," commented Johnathan Hayes, a former NYPD detective turned security consultant.

Investigations continue as officers sift through CCTV footage from the marina's area and review guest lists cross-referenced with times they reportedly went missing; while no suspect has been
