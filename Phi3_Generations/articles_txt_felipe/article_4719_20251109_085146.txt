Scientists announce newfound comet set to make close pass by Earth in 2067: "A remarkable discovery," exclaims Dr. Emily Carter, an astronomer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Named 'Nuestra Señora de Los Ángeles,' or Our Lady of Los Angeles, this comet will make its closest approach to Earth next year after a lengthy journey through our solar system and beyond, visible without telescopes as it dazzles the night sky.

"It's truly one of those once-in-a-lifetime events," said Dr. Carter during an interview with CNN on Tuesday morning where she explained that 'Our Lady de Los Angeles,' initially detected in 2049, will make its first appearance visible to the naked eye next February when it zooms through our night sky at a mere distance of approximately three times Earth's diameter.

The comet was identified by NASA’s NEOWISE mission onboard their Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer spacecraft, which scans near-Earth objects in the hope to understand better how these celestial bodies could affect our planet if they were headed that way. This discovery marks a significant success for this pioneering program and its automated search systems designed by Dr. Carter's team at JPL since NEOWISE became fully operational last year, after being retired from studying the sun in 2017 due to overheating issues of their infrared instrumentation onboard WISE (Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer).

"When we first spotted it back then with our automated systems and alerted colleagues here, I couldn't believe my eyes. It was nothing short than stunning," Dr. Carter reflected as she recounted the moment of discovery to CNN Newsroom anchor Brian Anderson in front of a massive display board filled with NEOWISE data visualizations that had everyone nodding along for credibility and interest - especially given this comet's rarity, having left its original solar system family some 6 million years ago.

As astronomers continue to study the peculiar characteristics of 'Our Lady de Los Angeles,' it is already clear from initial observations by Dr. Carter’s team that unlike typical dirty snowball asteroids found in our Solar System – comets are not made only of ice and rock - this one contains an unusual mix, hinting at a possible origin far beyond Neptune's orbit where conditions might be more conducive for complex organic molecules to form.

"The composition is unique," said Dr. Carter during her interview with The Daily Mail on Friday evening as she unravelled findings from the preliminary spectroscopy analysis done using ground-based telescopes and space observatories like Hubble, Spitzer, Herschel, among others which have already been scheduled to study this newcomer up close. "We’re excited about these initial results suggesting organic molecules – compounds essential for life as we know it.”

Senior planetary scientist Dr. Rajiv Singh at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), who specializes in comet chemistry, is eager to see if 'Our Lady de Los Angeles' might shed light on mysteries concerning how our Solar System evolved and why it contains such a diverse range of material with varying origins.
