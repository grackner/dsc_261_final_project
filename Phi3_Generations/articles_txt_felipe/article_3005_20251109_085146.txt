In a significant development in food safety regulations across South America, Brazil has announced an immediate nationwide recall of all genetically modified soy products sold since January due to contamination fears and public health concerns raised this weekend by experts at the National Health Institute (NHI). The move affects millions as GMO-based food items are widely used in animal feed, processed goods, and even some organic crops.

Experts believe that unidentified chemical agents could be causing unexpected allergies among populations consuming these products regularly. This revelation follows a spike of similar cases across Argentina and Colombia last month when they also recalled certain GMO produce after initial reports surfaced, which has sparked an urgent need for global standardization in food safety testing methods related to genetically modified crops.

In São Paulo alone, officials estimate that around 3 million people have been directly impacted by the recall of over 10 different GMO soy products with a combined market value exceeding $250 million annually before this issue emerged. Dr. Maria Silva, head researcher at NHI's Food and Environment Research Unit in Rio de Janeiro stated that "The presence of unverified chemical agents could potentially compromise consumer health; hence it is vital to halt their circulation until further analysis."

In response to these findings, the government has called for immediate inspections into all food imports containing GMO content from neighboring countries. Furthermore, they are working closely with international organizations like WHO and FAO to develop standardized testing methodologies that can quickly identify contaminants in genetically modified crops on a global scale before their distribution networks reach the market.

As these investigations continue, consumers across South America have been advised by local governments not only limit intake of GMO-based food items but also opt for organic produce whenever possible until further notice after this alarming incident that has brought questions surrounding genetically modified crops back into public consciousness.
