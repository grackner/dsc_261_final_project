A leading fashion house has announced a partnership with local designers to promote sustainable practices within their supply chains throughout New York City this summer. Gucci NYC is teaming up with four independent fashion boutiques from Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens for the 'Eco-Fashion Initiative' starting July 1st in an effort to reduce environmental impacts while still providing stylish options for city dwellers seeking eco-conscious wardrobe updates.

Speaking at a press conference yesterday, Anna Lazzaro Gucci NYC President said the partnership was not only beneficial from a sustainability standpoint but also aimed to foster creativity in fashion design through collaboration with independent brands known for their unique styles and innovative ideas: "We are thrilled to work alongside these talented local boutiques. Our goal is simple - make style go hand-in end with responsible choices that do not compromise on the environment."

As per a press release, there will be regular fashion showcases featuring collections made from eco-friendly fabrics and recycled materials throughout July at locations including Madison Square Garden's Fashion Club. Additionally, Gucci NYC is pledging to audit its supply chain within the next six months with help from experts on sustainable business practices in fashion industry provided by Columbia University’s Stern School of Business. 

“By combining style and responsibility when it comes to environmental matters,” said Daniel Kessler, one-time owner of a local boutique now part of Gucci NYC partnership; “we can change the narrative about what eco-fashion looks like.” The fashion house hopes that this collaboration will inspire consumers citywide and promote greater awareness regarding sustainability in everyday wardrobe choices.
