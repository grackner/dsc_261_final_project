A massive earthquake struck Japan's east coast at around 3 AM local time today, registering a 7.8 magnitude on the Richter scale and causing widespdependent chaos across Tokyo Bay Area in Miyagi Prefecture—a region not accustomed to such seismic activity.


The tremors were first felt early this morning as people began their daily commutes, with reports of significant shaking throughout the prefecture including Tokyo and Sendai. The earthquake struck roughly 10 kilometers beneath the ocean floor off Miyagi's coastline near Onagawa Town before seismic activity was observed across cities closer to shore within an hour after initial shockwaves were detected by sensors at Japan Meteorological Agency headquarters in Tokyo around 4 AM.


"This is one of our strongest quakes in years," said Dr. Hiroshi Tanaka, a geophysicist with the University of Tohoku and consultant for Miyagi Prefecture's disaster prevention agency earlier today during an interview on NHK Newsline. "It will take time to assess all potential damage; it is still too early."


The tremor triggered a series of aftershocks, the largest registering 5.4 in magnitude and occurring about three hours post-main quake with its epicenter approximately 18 kilometers from Sendai city center according to data published by JMA at around 7:30 AM local time today via their official Twitter account—JMAEarthquakes is now @jmaearthquakes.


In Tokyo, the tremors were felt strongly in commercial districts along Ginza Street and Shibuya Crossing but less so further away from coastal regions as seismic activity dissipated after reaching a 6 on Richter scale—the city's building codes meant designed structures could withstand such shakes. Residents, though alarmed by the initial quake tremors that woke many Tokyoites up early in their bedrooms, found solace in knowing they had some measure of preparedness due to regular earthquake drills organized since 2019 as part of national safety protocols aimed at mitigating damage from future seismic events.


"I just felt it shaking my whole apartment—it was terrifying," recalled Akiko Yamamoto, who resides in Chuo Ward's Roppongi district near Shibuya Crossing as she shared her experience over the phone today to CNNJapan News. "But after years of practice, I know how to protect myself and my family during such times; our emergency kit is right here with us," pointing at a small bag beside her on the bedside table packed with essentials including water bottles, first aid supplies, non-perishable food items.


Officials in Miyagi Prefecture are taking necessary steps to ensure public safety and addressing potential infrastructural damage as they dispatch rescue teams along evacuation routes designated by local authorities—many of which have been reinforced since the 2011 Tohoku earthquake that devastated parts of Japan. Meanwhile, coastal residents who live in wooden houses remain on high alert for tsunami warnings with advisories already issued at several ports and fishing towns along Miyagi's shorelines by prefectural officials today around 8 AM local time—the
