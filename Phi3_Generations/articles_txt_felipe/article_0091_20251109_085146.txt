In an unprecedented move that has drawn international attention to New York City' enduring architectural legacy and future direction, renowned firm Smith + Wollers Architecture recently completed a bold new design for One World Trade Center on its 104th floor – the first skyscraper with a "floating glass dome" in existence. The announcement came today by CEO Robert Anderson during a press conference at NYU’s School of Architecture and Planning, where he revealed plans set to be finalized this fall for what could become one of the city's most iconic landmarks if it garners approval from local authorities expected next month.

"It is our privilege to present a design that pushes boundaries while still paying homage to New York’s skyline history," said Anderson, as journalists and architectural enthusiasts gathered in the room buzzed with anticipation at his reveal of an image depicting One World Trade Center's newfangled glass dome hovering above.

The design was unveiled to the public during a special event hosted by Mayor Bill de Blasio and held yesterday morning inside NYU’s School of Architecture, with more than 100 attendees including students eagerly listening for news on this controversial project aimed towards reinventing modern architecture in New York.

“This floating glass dome represents a revolutionary step forward for our city's skyline,” said de Blasio during the announcement, “and it’s important that we explore new possibilities as architectural developments continue to evolve.” 

Sarah Greenberg, an associate professor of architecture at NYU and expert in sustainable design practices commented on the importance of incorporating green technology within such ambitious projects saying: "This project could serve not only a symbolic purpose for New Yorkers who remember tragically how their city was affected by terror attacks but also demonstrates that progressive environmental solutions are possible when modern architecture meets historic sensibilities."

With plans expected to be approved next month, it remains uncertain whether this radical design will gain approval from local authorities as some question its impact on the visual aesthetic of New York City’s skyline and how much additional funding such an ambitious project would require. Local architectural historian Dr. Thomas O'Malley weighed in during his interview with WABC-TV, where he noted that while designs like this may initially seem outlandish to some observers: “When you look back on history of New York City’s architecture there are examples such as the Chrysler Building and Empire State building which have always been innovative; today we must reimagine what it means for a skyscraper not just to stand tall but also become an integral part of our environment.”

As public reaction continues both positive responses from progressive architectural communities along with concerns among traditionalists who are wary about changes impacting iconic city skyline; the world eagerly watches what may come next as Smith + Wollers Architecture works to finalize their daring design proposal. Whether or not it becomes a reality, One World Trade Center’s “floating glass dome” concept stands ready for discussion and further exploration from architectural students at universities nationwide into the future of modern architecture within an ever-changing world city setting like New York City itself – as noted by professor Greenberg during her interview on The Today Show, "This design could open new dialogues between tradition and innovation
