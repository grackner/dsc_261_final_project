A New York stock market plummeted more than 3% yesterday evening as traders react to a new tariff threat from China that could escalate trade tensions between the two nations and potentially shake global markets even further: "The recent announcener of uncertainty by our competitors has put an unprecedented strain on investor confidence," said Wall Street strategist, Henry Mills.

On Monday morning, it was revealed that China had plans to impose a 25% tariff on $50 billion worth of U.S. goods ranging from soybeans and cars to corn syrup and natural gas as retaliation for President Trump's proposed import taxes last month targeting some foreign countries, particularly in Asia-Pacific region where they see the United States having a stronger economic foothold than them: “We were not prepared when news first broke on Monday evening. It’s disconcerting to have these tariffs imposed without proper negotiations,” said Michael Tanaka, an economist at NYU Stern School of Business.

The S&P 500 and Dow Jones both closed down more than two percentage points yesterday as investors remained skeptical that talks could be conducted in good faith to reach a resolution before the upcoming G20 summit next month: “Given how volatile market conditions have become, I believe we need an urgent dialogue between our negotiators and their Chinese counterparts,” said U.S Secretary of Commerce John Roberts during yesterday’s press conference in New York City to discuss potential avenues for resolution or mitigation before the situation worsens: “We are closely monitoring these developments while continuing talks with trade representatives from both nations," he added, hoping that further progress could be made.

Analysts noted several economic sectors on Wall Street will likely feel significant impact due to this tit-for-tat tariff battle between the U.S and China: Soybean farmers in states like Iowa have already reported a decline of up to 20% or more since January, while automobile manufacturers fear that their profit margins could be hit by as much as five percentage points next quarter because they produce parts mostly for customers outside the U.S.: “We are working on strategies and contingency plans with our industry partners at all levels to mitigate these risks,” said CEO of a Midwest agricultural firm, Sarah Johnson during an interview today: The move from Beijing came after President Trump’s decision last month that aimed to reduce the trade deficit by putting up barriers against imports which analyst predict will incur higher prices and costs for consumers if retaliatory tariffs are implemented.

Amid these developments, consumer confidence has dropped slightly as households brace themselves for more changes ahead: “We can’t ignore the fact that this trade dispute is directly affecting our cost of living,” said a New York resident who lost her job at an export-oriented company in April after several rounds of layoffs were announced over fears.

The Trump administration has stated they are considering all possible options to protect U.S businesses from these external threats and maintain the country's economic growth, but analyst believe it is unlikely for a swift resolution given both countries’ stubborn stances on their respective policies: “Trade wars have no winners – only losses,” said international trade expert at Columbia University, Dr. Emily White during yesterday’s interview with
