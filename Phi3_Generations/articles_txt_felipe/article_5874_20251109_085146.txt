Boston Gets Unprecedented Winter Storm Amid Fears of a Polar Vortex
March 15th, 2decmber - A rare winter storm warning is in effect for Boston and surrounding areas as an intense polar vortex brings below-zero temperatures through the end of the month. According to officials from the National Weather Service (NWS), a record low of -30°F (-34°C) was recorded at Logan International Airport yesterday, with more freezing cold days expected in Boston and its neighboring cities well into next week due to the polar vortex event which scientists say is becoming increasingly common.
"We are experiencing some extreme weather conditions that have come down upon us from above," said Mayor Kim Janey of Boston during a press conference today, warning residents about potential travel disruptions and advising them on safety precautions in the freezing temperatures expected to last at least 48 hours.
Experts say polar vortices are large areas of low pressure surrounding the poles, which can move south when conditions favor a more intense vortex over the Arctic region due to temperature differences between different latitudes and altitudes as well as changes in jet stream dynamics caused by global climate change impacts. The NWS reports that this year's polar vortex is one of the strongest ever recorded, stretching from New York City all the way down to southern Texas with a significant drop in temperatures across much of North America - including Boston which has not seen such cold since February 1978 when an extreme winter storm left residents stranded for days.
"The intensity and rapid movement associated with this year's polar vortex is truly remarkable," said Dr. Eric Johnson, atmospheric scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). "It appears to be a combination of natural variability on one hand, while also being linked to some underlying changes in our climate system."
As people across New England hunker down against frigid temperatures and strong winds that make it feel even colder outside - with snowfall totals already reaching upwards 20-30 inches overnight -- Boston Public School officials have decided on an emergency remote learning plan for students until further notice. This comes after the city experienced rolling power outages due to heavy downpours and ice buildup last week that caused nearly half of all homes in the Merrimack Valley area alone lose electricity service amid temperatures dropping below freezing overnight leading authorities urging people not to panic buy on essential items like milk or bread before leaving home when heading out today for groceries as long lines have formed at many stores already.
"The situation is severe, but we are working around the clock with local utilities and emergency services teams trying our best efforts while also advising people not to take unnecessary risks by driving in these harsh conditions," said Acting Commissioner of Public Health Dr. Laura Harris-Beach during a televised briefing today evening alongside Mayor Janey about how resources are being stretched thin across the city due to snow removal and potential medical emergencies arising from exposure or hypothermia risks among vulnerable populations who may not have proper heating at home including elderly residents without adequate winter gear already reported by community leaders over social media channels expressing concerns about how people are coping with this unprecedented event affecting millions nationwide.
Governors from other states affected by the storm urged their own citizens not to travel as
