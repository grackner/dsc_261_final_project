EVERTON—A local makeup artist has started a trend that's capturing attention on social media and is now being hailed as 'the new age of beauty'. Rachel Summers, based in the heartland city of Everton, began experimenting with unconventional looks earlier this month by merging vintage Hollywood styles with modern minimalism.

Ever since she started posting on Instagram three weeks ago under her handle @Rachel'sRetroMakeup, Summers has amassed over 10,00thousand followers and become a go-to source for aspiring makeup enthusiasts eager to recreate iconic glamour.

"I wanted something that felt timeless yet accessible," says Summers on her latest Instagram post. "Everyone's embracing bold statements now, so I thought why not bring back the classic elegance of golden eras and blend it with today’s simplicity."

Summers combines old-school red lipstick techniques using matte finishes in rich tones like burgundy or crimson; long lashes are accented by a warm, velvety cream mascara that complements the lips. She credits movies of yesteryear for inspiration and admires how style icons such as Audrey Hepburn maintained their classic beauty without compromising modern sensibilities:

"It’s about finding balance," says Summers, recalling her favorite silver screen siren while applying foundation in the soft light filtering through a nearby window. "Audrey always looked effortlessly chic with just enough makeup to define and frame her features."

Local hairdresser Peter Collins notes that alongside Rachel's unique looks, more clients are requesting similar styles: 35% of his salon’s appointments last month were specifically for requests inspired by Summers. "People want something special but not over the top," he explains while expertly styling a client who has requested an Audrey-inspired look after viewing Rachel's Instagram feed.

As social media continues to serve as her platform, and style icons like Zendaya Jones continue with their own takes on retro glamour—a phenomenon she calls 'Celebrity Makeup Migration’—the 25-year old Summers is becoming increasingly confident about sharing the lookbook for this fresh take.

"I've seen firsthand how my work can make people feel beautiful, and I love that it gets them to think outside their comfort zone," Rachel says with a smile as she sets up her brushes on a clean mirrored surface in front of Everton’s boutique beauty supply store. “It feels empowering.”

Beauty experts say the 'Rachel's Retro Makeup Migration', which Summers jokes about, represents more than just following trends—it fosters self-expression and a new appreciation for classic makeup styles while maintaining individuality: "It’s refreshing to see modern faces embracing elegance from the past," comments Dr. Emma Lee, a renowned New York City cosmetic chemist who's followed Summers’ rise on social media.

As of this weekend, Rachel has shared her recipe for the perfect retro-inspired makeup look that includes step by step tutorials and ingredient lists available to all fans interested in recreating these vint
