An international tribunal has been set up to address an escalating conflict in a small region of South America that began last month and now threatens global stability according to analysts. The UN Security Council voted unanimously on Tuesday, December 10th, with the approval code-named "Operation Resilience."

The tribunal is expected to convene in Geneva next week where representatives from three continents will present their cases for a resolution aimed at bringing peace and justice back to this troubled area. As of now, over 50 casualties have been reported since the uprising started on December 3rd, with numerous displaced persons fleeing perilous conditions in search of safety.

"The situation has rapidly deteriorated," said Ambassador Susan Greenfield from Britain at today's meeting held by UN officials. "We must act quickly and decisively to prevent further suffering." Her words echoed the urgent tone shared among member states, as they call for swift action without resorting to military intervention.

Experts have pointed out that economic factors heavily influenced this unrest: disparities in wealth distribution leading up years before has been a consistent source of discontent within local communities since 2015 when the mining boom first began providing new opportunities for growth but also deepened socio-estatic divides among different ethnic groups native to these lands.

The UN's High Representative, Janet Marquez emphasized that "It is crucial we find a peaceful resolution without infringing upon the rights of any party involved." Despite some disagreements over how best handle this delicate situation - with suggestions ranging from humanitarian aid programs to possible international mediation efforts - all parties seem committed towards achieving an enduring solution that respects local cultures while promoting lasting peace.

Next steps will include extensive negotiations during the tribunal meetings, as well as continued monitoring of developments on-site by various NGO's and human rights observers who have reported alarming increases in violence over recent days — particularly around major towns such as Santiago del Norte (fictitious name). These reports could influence decision making at Geneva where a comprehensive strategy is being formulated to restore stability.
