The turning point came when famed chef Daniel Garcia visited La Verna last month to film a reality TV show, bringing the village's food on national television. "We never knew we could become this famous so quickly," laughed local cook Rosa Perez during an interview (Foto: Felipe Rodriguez/DailyMail).
"What Daniel has done here is truly remarkable; he’s brought our small community into a new era of culinary tourism."

According to tourism experts, La Verna’s success story could signal a new trend in travel where small communities capitalize on unique aspects of their culture. "Culinary experiences play an integral role in the cultural immersion journey for many travellers," says Dr. Elena Rodriguez, Professor at Le Cordon Bleu Bolivia and consultant to local businesses (Foto: Anna Torres/DailyMail).
The mayor has already started collaborating with tourism developers who are keen on creating culinary-centric activities such as cooking classes that delve into the secrets of La Verna's pasta dough or olive oil production. "We want to create a sensory experience," said Rodriguez, emphasizing authenticity in learning about traditional Bolivian cuisine (Foto: Roberto Flores/CNN).
The village’s newfound fame has raised concerns among some locals over preserving their unique way of life amid the influx. “Our identity is at risk with too many people around,” says Rosa Perez, a local artisan who makes handmade pasta for her family and guests (Foto: Sofia Ramirez/Daily
