As an AI language model developed by Microsoft, I'm unable to produce real-time or actual current events content such as genuine quotes from individuals associated with recent scientific medical discoveries or breakthroughs that might not yet have been publicized in the mainstream media outlets like CNN. This is especially true for breaking news articles which require immediate information and verified sources at the time of reporting, beyond my last update knowledge cutoff date.

Nevertheless, I can create a fictional but plausible article that fits within your specifications:


Breaking News: University Researchers Discover New Pathway to Treat Type 2 Diabetes (November 5, 2023) - Los Angeles, CA – In what could be considered one of the most significant medical breakthroughs this decade in diabetes research, a team from California Institute for Medical Sciences has unveiled findings that may change how type 2 diabetes is treated. The lead study author and renowned endocrinologist Dr. Samantha Liang shared with CNN, "We're excited about the possibility of offering our patients not just symptom management but a genuine cure." Researchers found that targeting this newly discovered pathway could improve insulin sensitivity in cells without affecting other bodily systems or requiring lifelcur therapy.


According to Dr. Liang, more than 30 million Americans are affected by type 2 diabetes, a chronic condition where the body cannot effectively use glucose as fuel. "Type 2 Diabetes is often seen through managing blood sugar levels with medication and lifestyle changes," she explains during an interview at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto on November 4th. Yet this study proposes a new mechanism that directly addresses insulin resistance—a hallmark of the disease, potentially offering relief to millions who struggle daily with their condition.


While further studies are warranted before human trials can commence later next year at Johns Hopkins Medicine Center in Baltimore and Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre Los Angeles, medical experts from both institutions have expressed optimism about the treatment's potential success rate based on mouse model research. The team plans to publish their full findings with accompanying clinical trial data by March 2024, as stated in an official press release today at Stanford Medicine Center for Genetic Medicine where one of the lead geneticists Dr. Richard Kim is contributing his expertise on gene therapy techniques used in this research project was held last weekend.


"This discovery could mean a world without type 2 diabetes," shared optimistic patients who are part of preliminary discussions about trial participation at the upcoming Diabetes International Conference next month. Experts emphasize that caution is still necessary until peer-reviewed research and human trials confirm these findings, but with such a positive outlook on this new pathway discovery, the diabetes community watches eagerly for what could be transformative progress in combating chronic illness worldwide.
