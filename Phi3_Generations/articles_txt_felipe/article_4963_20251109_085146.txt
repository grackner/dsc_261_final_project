In an unexpected turn of events in New Delhi yesterday evening at around 6 PM local time, a large section of East Circular Road collapsed under heavy rainfall causing multiple injuries and leaving hundreds without homes amidst the monsoon season's worst on record. The incident has drawn immediate attention as one of India’thelargest cities grapples with its most devastating weather impact in decades, prompting city officials to declare a state of emergency while rescue operations are underway along East Circular Road between Sevagram and Raja Nahar Singh Marg.

As the rainfall reached record-breaking levels last night after days of persistent downpour across the region, local authorities were caught off guard by the sudden collapse near Mukesh Arora's apartment complex located on the south end of East Circular Road; his family and friends estimate that over 100 families share this residential block. Authorities are still trying to determine how many individuals have been affected, with initial reports suggesting upwards of two dozen people might be injured or displaced as entire sections of homes tumbled into narrow gullies formed by the roadway's previous embankments – now completely washed away in a matter of minutes.

"We were just coming out from our apartments when I heard this loud noise and saw smoke rising on top of one building," said Mukesh Arora, whose two children sustained minor injuries after falling debris struck them as they played outside with their friends. "It's a complete disaster; we lost everything."

The New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC), responsible for maintaining East Circular Road and its surrounding areas, has been criticized in the past by residents over poor infrastructure that fails to manage heavy rainfall effectively – notably during this very year's monsoon season which saw 40% more rain than average. In light of these concerns, city officials are investigating how long-term neglect may have contributed to today's disaster; however there is no official comment yet on the matter as rescue efforts continue unhindered amidst downpours predicted by meteorologists will persist through tonight and into tomorrow morning at peak levels.

"This calamity has exposed our inadequacies regarding urban planning," said a frustrated local councilor, speaking to reporters outside the collapsed site alongside concerned citizens onlookers who have brought blankets for shelter as night sets in – temperatures are expected to drop below 10°C during overnight hours. "We need long-term solutions that prioritize safety measures against extreme weather events."

In addition, multiple news outlets reported witnessing vehicles stuck and unable to drive due to fallen debris blocking off sections of East Circular Road while commuters have been left stranded at the nearest bus stop just blocks away from their homes; some passengers lament over missed appointments or work as they stand waiting for transportation along with others in hopes that relief might arrive shortly. Emergency services are also on alert amidst reports about possible aftershocks following a similar but lesser-scale incident last week at another location within the city, where power lines went down causing disru_cations to several neighborhood areas – authorities assure residents these risks have been minimized for now as experts work around nonstop shifts.

As rescue crews continue their operations throughout tonight and tomorrow morning in what is likely going to be a grueling task, local
