Former MLB star accused of stealing uniforms for personal use was found in possession of multiple sets during pre-season inventory at Springfield Baseball Academy on April 4th. The former teammate and current instructor, who had been part of the academy's coaching staff since February but left due to unrelated issues last month, now faces allegations that not only tarnish his reputation in baseball circles, as well as broader public perception, reports CNN Sports Extra.

Mark Thompson has always shown passion for nurturing young talent at Springfield Baseball Academy and was highly regarded by former students who are still actively pursuing their careers with the academy's blessing until last month when his relationship soured due to personal differences unrelated to work performance or conduct, according to multiple sources close to him.

However, Thompson has now come under fire for allegedly hoarding hundreds of MLB-grade uniform sets meant for student use as per inventory logs maintained by the academy and found hiding in his recently vacated office during pre-season cleanup on April 4th – just days before commencement ceremonies.

"We never suspected anything like this," said Academy Director Michael Johnson, adding that he was astounded when evidence started to surface as student uniforms slowly began disappearing after Thompson's sudden departure without prior notice of his plans for a vacation or sabbatical leave. "Mark has always been an exceptional coach and mentor here at the academy but this conduct is unacceptable."

The 46-year old former player was seen wearing one set while instructing on field practices until he abruptly stopped attending sessions, causing confusion among staff members about his whereabouts. As for how Thompson managed to acquire these high-quality uniform sets in the first place remains a mystery as they are supposed to be exclusive commodities available through approved vendors at designated times throughout seasons and academic terms - none of which applies during pre-season inventory, sources note.

"He seemed genuinely concerned about his former students' performance before he left so I never thought twice," shared a current trainer who once worked alongside Thompson when asked why their colleague failed to return for the commencement ceremonies scheduled later in April - an event that typically features speeches, presentations and much fanfare as graduating seniors move forward with next steps towards professional play.

The Academy has since launched its own internal investigation into this matter after several students came forth expressing their discontent regarding Thompson's unexplained absence during the crucial time before final exams - something that a representative from student council mentioned as pivotal for those hoping to secure spots on professional teams down the line.

"We need answers," stated Council President Emily Rodriguez, "Many of us looked forward with great anticipation and dedication over countless hours spent perfecting our skills only under his tutelage but now it feels like all that effort has gone to waste." The academy's sports psychologist Dr. Samantha Lee added her professional observation on how such events can have an impact not just physically, but emotionally too with regards the students involved in this case as she stressed: "These kinds of experiences disrupt their focus and undermine morale."

In response to these developments concerning Thompson's alleged misconduct at Springfield Baseball Academy he released a statement on April 6th wherein he vehemently denied any involvement with such
