In a dramatic turn of events this weekend in Guatemala City, authorities have made an arrest related to the disappearance of three American tourists back in August when they went hiking on Mount Tacaná. The suspect was identified as Luis Ortiz Alvarado, whom investigators believe had known interactions with one of the victims prior to their hike.

During a press conference held yesterday afternoon at Central Station Plaza near Independence Square in Guatemala City, Federal Prosecutor Alejandro Vásquez stated that "Luis Ortiz Alvarado has been detained on suspicion for his involvement with the disappearance of these tourists. We will continue to investigate this disturbing incident."

The hikers were last seen by their companions before they departed from La Aurora International Airport in Guatemala City, heading towards Mount Tacaná as part of a local adventure activity organized on August 12th and 13th. All three tourists - Jennifer Clarkson (48), David Thompson (56) – both hailing from Seattle, Washington, and Lily Rodriguez (37) who is originally from Miami but currently resides in Los Angeles were avid hikers with extensive experience prior to this trip. Their families expressed fear over their wellbeing after a week passed without any communication or sightings of the three friends on social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram, where they would typically post pictures during such trips.

The disappearance has sparked concern among citizens in Guatemala as it brings back painful memories of several past disappearances that have left many families devastated over years – a fact reflected by local resident Juan Gutierrez who said "It's heartbreaking, this is not the first time we are living through such an ordeal."

During questioning at Guatemala City's Public Security Police headquarters today (August 24th), Ortiz confessed to a friend he made on August 10th that they went for a "casual hike" with Clarkson, Thompson and Rodriguez but did not return by nightfall. The authorities allege the suspect met these hikers at Hotel Los Arroyos located near San Miguel Escuintla before starting their journey to Mount Tacaná on August 12th morning around 9 AM local time when temperatures were still high, reaching an average of nearly 80°F (approx. 27°C).

Witness Mariana Guzmán remembers seeing Ortiz and the tourists together at Hotel Los Arroyos on August 10th where he was working as a bellhop service attendant during their stay: "I remember they were all very nice people, but I never thought anything out of the ordinary about this group."

Upon locating some abandoned backpacks near Mount Tacaná's base camp area on August 14th - exactly two weeks after the hikers disappeared – authorities discovered a note saying "We are safe here," suggesting that they might have been taken captive. However, it remains unclear whether these were merely lost items or clues to their whereabouts; investigators reportedly found no physical signs of struggle on any personal belongings recovered from this site nor nearby campsites with overnight facilities for hikers used during the hike period which typically accommodate groups like Clarkson, Thompson and Rodriguez.
