In a surprising turn of events that has captured national attention in real time as Saturday’s college football playoff semifinal match unfolded on Saturdays at Noon ET from Atlanta'th Mercedes-Benz Stadium, the underdog team faced off against their seasoned opponent. The game was predicted to be a tight contest but came down to the wire with an unexpected score in favor of Clemson Tigers over Florida State Seminoles lasting 3 hours and 15 minutes before ending on Saturday afternoon at Atlanta’s iconic venue, drawing fans from all across Georgia into what has been one for the ages.

"This is a historic matchup that we can look back to in years coming," said Dr. Amanda Brownfield of Clemson University's athletics department after the game had ended and her team celebrated their victory over FCS foe Florida State Seminoles with jubilation at Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Atlanta on Saturday afternoon (02/15).

According to ESPN Sports Analyst Dr. Peter Taylor, this matchup saw some of the most explosive plays in recent college football history and left fans eager for more from both teams heading into a potential rematch next month at home-field ACC champion Virginia Commonwealth University (02/16). "The offensive schemes employed by Clemson are top notch, especially their trick plays. I think it's only going to get better as we move forward."

Florida State Seminoles Head Coach Jimbo Fisher addressed the team post-match with encouragement about how they can still compete for a spot in the national title game: "We left nothing on the field today. I believe our young players have great potential, and if we continue to improve ourselves as a unit both individually and collectively then anything is possible."

The semifinal was one of six contested this season across various bowl games with over 150 collegiate athletes competing for bragging rights until all are crowned national champions at the end. The stakes were high from beginning to finish as Georgia State University’s football team, a historically unremarkable program in their own right without conference championships under any circumstances since joining Division I FBS years ago (02/17), had nothing riding on this particular match besides pride and passion for the game.

The Seminoles began briskly with quarterback Bryce Harper leading his team down to a 7-3 deficit by halftime, but Clemson Tigers countered in spades throughout most of second half as offensive weaponry came into play – particularly when senior running back Jake Johnson broke free for an astounding touchdown run from just beyond the line on third and seventeen yards.

“I don’t know about you all, but we never thought a team like Georgia State would have us believing they could give this match up to anyone," shared Coach Mike Ross of his defeated Seminoles squad following the final whistle sounding (02/18). "But our young players showed that no matter who comes into your league, there’s always hope for glory."

Clemson Tigers Head Coach Dabo Swinney echoed similar sentiments after his team emerged victorious: “We knew going in tonight would be tough but we didn't underestimate our opponent. We believed that with hard work, dedication and respect for one another - both as individuals & teams
