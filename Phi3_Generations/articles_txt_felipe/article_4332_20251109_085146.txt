Topic: Health - Sleep

A recent study conducted by the National Sleep Foundation highlighted a growing concern among adult Americans over their sleep patterns and habits during these unprecedent times of change in lifestyle due to technology advancements and work from home setups becoming more commonplace (Health, New York City - November 2021). The study reveals that almost one-third of the population struggles with insomnia or poor sleep quality.

Dr. Sarah Miller, a leading researcher on slumber issues at Columbia University Medical Center and an author of this report states: "Sleep deprivation can have serious consequences for overall health if not addressed timely." She further warns about the association between chronic insufficient rest and conditions such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease or even mental disorders like depression.

The foundation's report surveyed over 10,000 adult Americans across different age groups ranging from young professionals in their twenties to senior citizens above the retirement age of 65 years (Columbia University Medical Center - November 2021). The findings revealed that nearly half suffer some form of sleep disturbance due largely to stress, excessive screen time and sedentary lifestyles.

In a statement issued on Nov. 13th by the National Sleep Foundation President Dr James Walton said: "Such alarming figures about poor-quality sleep underscore an urgent need for society as we know it today to reassess our current attitudes towards work, technology usage and lifestyle choices."

The impact of this growing trend extends beyond individual health; employers are beginning to feel the effects too. In a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed piece titled 'Work Smarter: Not Harder,' business consultant John Davis highlights how sleep deprivation is costing American companies billions annually in decreased productivity, more sick days and even potential safety risks (Wall Street Journal - November 20th).

Davis explains that "when employees don't get enough quality restful slumber at nighttime hours they show up to work less focused during working hours which can lead not only to mistakes but also injuries." Furthermore, he states how employers should consider investing in programs and resources promoting healthy sleep habits for their staff.

In light of these findings on poor-quality rest affecting millions across the country daily - it is now time that we address this issue head-on at all levels; from individual lifestyle choices to societal structures like work environments, technology usage and more (Columbia University Medical Center News - November 23rd). The foundation hopes for a collaborative effort amongst health professionals, employers and even technological companies in creating awareness about the importance of good sleep habits.

"Good quality nightly rest is not only essential to our overall wellbeing but also critical in maintaining mental acuity during waking hours," says Dr Sarah Miller at Columbia University Medical Center's Institute for Sleep Medicine who contributed significantly towards this report (Institute News - November 25th).

The research findings will be shared with policy makers and public health officials nationwide to potentially inform upcoming guidelines that advocate better work-life balance strategies, technology policies at home & workplace as well as improved sleep hygiene education programs. As this issue gains wider attention in society; experts urge the general population not only realize its
