A team of international astronomers have discovered a potentially habitable planet orbiting within the 'Goldilocks Zone' where conditions could be right for water to exist in its liquid state on the surface – an unprecedented find that has captured scientific interest worldwide as it may hold clues about extraterrestrial life. The exoplanet, named Kepler-1649c after the telescope used in its discovery located approximately 300 light-years away from Earth within our Milky Way galaxy'thy location is of immense interest to astronomers and astrobiologists alike as this could be one step closer to finding another Earth. The team, led by Dr. Emily Richardson at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), announced the discovery on March 15th from their California facility via a live webcast that attracted millions of viewers globally across various platforms – with CNN reporting an average audience concentration around five million people per platform during peak hours.

"This is truly one of humanity's most remarkable achievements to date in our ongoing quest for extraterrestrial life," Dr. Richardson said, emphasizing the potential implications this discovery has made a significant impact not only within scientific circles but also among those who eagerly follow space exploration news worldwide.

Existing data collected over numerous observations have allowed researchers to pinpoint Kepler-1649c as one of five planets orbiting its host star, which is slightly smaller and cooler than our sun – conditions that place it within the habitable zone where liquid water can exist on a planet's surface. Dr. Richardson further elaborated at her press conference: "Our measurements show temperatures in this exoplanet’s atmosphere range from -70 to 21°C, with possible pockets of atmospheres rich enough for life as we know it."

The size and mass of Kepler-1649c is estimated at about twice that of Earth's planet which could imply its surface gravity may be two times stronger. The exoplanet completes one full orbit around its star in 29 days, a period shorter than our own year but nonetheless promising when considering the existence and potential for life on other worlds within distant galaxies or solar systems like Kepler-1649c's home system – the Kepler System.

"Finding such an Earth-like planet is nothing short of spectac0ular, as it provides us with a unique opportunity to further study how common habitable planets might be in our galaxy and perhaps beyond," stated Dr. Michael Thompson, leading astrophysicist from the University of Texas at Austin who has been monitoring exoplanetary systems for over two decades. He shared his thoughts during an interview with CNN: "Kepler-1649c opens new doors to understanding our universe better and provides a hopeful path forward in identifying even more habitable planets."

The discovery is the latest breakthrough following years of intensive research that involved analyzing data gathered by NASA's Kepler spacecraft which was launched nearly ten years ago with its primary mission being locating Earth-size exoplanets orbiting within their sun’s 'habitable zone'. The findings have since led to a flurry of activity across international scientific communities, as organizations and governments alike aim for further exploration.
