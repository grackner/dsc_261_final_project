A sudden collapse of a local ice rink in Buffalo on Tuesday has raised alarms among hockey enthusiast extrinsically linked to safety concerns about aging infrastructure across the region's sports facilities. The incident occurred without warning at around 3 p.m., when players, officials and spectators heard loud noises followed by a crumbling sound from beneath them while on ice during an inter-scholty league game at Coca-Cola Arena, which has been home to Buffalo's amateur hockey scene for over three decades now that the rink is owned by Tops Friendly Markets.

"It was like a bomb going off," said witness Peter Johnson who watched from his seat just beyond rows of bleachers packed with supporters cheering on their local teams at Wednesday's matchup between Canisius College and Buffalo State University, which took place shortly after the collapse.

According to a report by NY Times reporter Dana Rubinstein covering sports across upstate New York yesterday morning – there are reports that this is not an isolated incident; other rinks in Erie County have experienced similar infrastructure failures leading some officials and community leaders questioning whether these structures should be retired entirely.

"This situation with the Coca-Cola Arena Rink has certainly brought to light our broader concerns about aging facilities here," said State Senator Tim Kennedy, one of several state legislators in upstate New York who have pushed for a comprehensive review into how infrastructure spending can be better used within local communities.

Hockey coach Tom Haley from Canisius College says his team practiced on the same rink just three days earlier with no issues reported and that it is still unclear what caused this afternoon's dramatic incident, which also resulted in several players being taken to hospitals for injuries including fractured legs.

"The timing of this collapse was absolutely unforeseen," said Haley who had been watching Wednesday night's game from the stands with his son David as he spoke about yesterday’s accident, adding that Coca-Cola Arena officials were quick to respond and have launched an investigation into how such a failure could occur in one of Buffalo's most well-maintained sports venues.

"The safety protocols we had are robust; however there will be some changes," said rink manager Patricia Thompson, addressing reporters yesterday evening about the ongoing review process which includes engineers and structural experts as they analyze footage from security cameras around where it is believed that a large section of concrete gave way.

The collapse occurred near row H14 between legs in play just after 3:02 p.m., sending several players sprawling on the ice while dozens more sought shelter behind benches and bleachers for safety from what was seen as an immediate danger to spectators who were warned not move away but stay where they are until officials confirm it is safe to leave their seats; fortunately there have been no reports of injuries beyond those already mentioned.

"I understand how shocking this must be, especially for families with children," said Mayor Byron Brown as he toured Coca-Cola Arena yesterday afternoon while also calling on community leaders across upstate New York to hold hearings where all these issues can be discussed in an open forum setting before any decisions about funding and revitalization efforts are made.
