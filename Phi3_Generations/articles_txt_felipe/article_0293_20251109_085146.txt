In a stunning upset last Saturday night at Kyle Field in Athens, Georgia, top-ranked Alabama Crimson Tide football team fell to underdog LSU Tigers by a score of 23-14, with the decisive touchdown coming from freshman quarterback Trey Smith just minutes before halftime.

The unexpected loss left coaches and players scrambling in disbelief as Alabama entered Saturday's game at No. 1 against LSU on a perfect 7–0 record heading into their fifth matchup of the season, according to ESPN’CTS data from last weekend alone. It was also only their second home loss since they began playing under coach Nick Saban in 2008 and Alabama has not lost at home this year until now.

Trey Smith's final drive started when he threw a perfect pass downfield to wideout Jayden Jones, who caught it just shy of the LSU end line but fell after making contact with defender Malik Freeney during what appeared an easy gain for Alabama as they marched on toward their first score.

Instead of celebrating at half-time like most teams do in a football game, Alabama fans were left confused and disheartened when Trey Smith threw another perfect pass downfield to wideout Caleb Collins just beyond the LSU line that started with an interception from Trayvon Wright for 13 yards. With no one on either side of his throw but receiver Marcus Jackson close enough, it appeared certain until running back Derrick Henry caught a bobbled ball in mid-air and was brought down by defender Terrance Crawford before crossing the goal line himself to score an unlikely touchdown for LSU that sealed Alabama's fate.

"This loss is unbelievable, I just don't understand what went wrong," said Saban after a tense 50-minute first half where both teams had scored two field goals each with no team leading by more than seven points at any time during the game. "Our defense needs to step up and we will continue to work on it as soon as possible."

According to LSU head coach Ed Orgeron, his Tigers came into Saturday's contest against Alabama already knowing they were in a position of strength after three straight wins since their season-opening victory over Ole Miss. "We are proud and excited about this win for our team," said the 61-year old former quarterback who is leading LSU to an undefeated start with just four games remaining before meeting Notre Dame next Saturday, reports Alabama Nation.

Coach Saban also addressed that no one was blamed after what happened in last night's game stating: "We had five timeouts and I felt like our guys did a great job of being able to take advantage of it when necessary." However he admitted his offense needs help with their decision making. 

LSU defensive coordinator Dave Aranda shared that after the loss, Alabama players showed respect towards LSU fans while expressing disappointment in themselves during post-game press conferences where reporters asked questions about how they responded to being on top of the team and what went wrong for them. "I thought our kids did a great job tonight when dealing with that situation, however I understand there is room for improvement," said Aranda who led Texas A&M as an assistant coach before taking his current position at LSU where he has been working since 2003
