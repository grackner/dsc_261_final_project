A Hollywood actor who has been making headlines for his philanthropic work was allegedly involved in a traffic accident late last night near Beverly Hills. The incident occurred just as the sun set on November 5th, when Michael Thompson, known primarily for his leading role in the blockbuster "Epic Quest", reported to be driving home after attending an award ceremony at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel where he received a lifetime achievement award from prominent actress Emily Stone.

Witnesses say that around 10:35 PM, Thompson's black convertible was rear-ended by another vehicle while trying to merge onto Mulholland Drive near Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. No major injuries were reported; however, both drivers sustained minor bruises and required medical attention on the scene before being transported for further treatment at local hospitals within an hour of the crash (CNN reports 16 similar traffic accidents involving actors this month alone).

"I saw a flash from behind. I think it was two cars, but one just blasted forward and hit him," said Maria Ramirez, who works in nearby Studio City as a production assistant on several Netflix series that shoot across the street during daytime hours when Thompson is often present for set visits or meetings with directors such as his long-time friend John Anderson.

Thompson's representative confirmed to reporters about 3:00 AM, "Mr. Thompson was in no condition to resume filming today." He also mentioned the actor had a minor cut and abrasion on their arm but is otherwise doing fine after being checked at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center this morning by Dr. Robert Haines who examined him before releasing, "Mr. Thompson's injuries appear superficial; he should make an excellent recovery."

The actor and his entourage are known to frequently travel in the area for charity events related to child education and literacy which is no surprise given that philanthropic efforts have always been a part of Mr. Thompson’s life since they started their foundation, "Healthy Minds Foundation" back in 2016 with his wife Jane Thomson-Williams (a former school principal) to aid underprivileged children throughout Los Angeles County and beyond; the couple has participated regularly for years now raising over $5 million dollars annually towards various causes including mental health, homelessness support systems as well.

Thompson's recent involvement in "Sunset Drive," a limited-release independent film by director Peter Olsen about family bonds set around Los Angeles’ elite neighborhoods has garnered much attention from critics and audiences alike, earning rave reviews with an average rating of 4.5 out of five stars across major streaming sites like Amazon Prime Video; the same cannot be said for his performance today though which left many concerned about how long it would take him to bounce back on set after being so shaken up by this unexpected event."

With news spreading rapidly through Hollywood circles, Thompson's agents released a statement saying he and Jane are planning more charity events but no definite date has been announced yet while fans continue hoping that their favorite actor will soon return to film sets full of energy like always as per his usual routine.
