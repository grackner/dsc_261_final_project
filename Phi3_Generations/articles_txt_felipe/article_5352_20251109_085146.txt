A catastrophic earthquake struck Kyoto Prefecture in Japan at around 3:05 AM local time on March 14th. The quake measured a staggering 7.8 magnitude, according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), making it one of the most powerful tremors recorded in recent Japanese history.

The disaster unfolded as many residents were sleeping or preparing for their day-to extricate themselves from bedrooms and start a fresh at work amidst rolling aftershocks, some with magnitudes reaching up to 5.3, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). Eyewitness reports indicate that several landslides were triggered in Hira Mountain Range within Shimane Prefecture following heavy rainfall days before the quake which may have destabilized slopes already weakened by tremors.

The USGS measured peak ground acceleration at a devastating 0.97g, while JMA reported nearly continuous aftershocks through yesterday and tonight with magnitudes ranging between 3-5.2 in the same area of Kyoto Prefecture where residents are still trapped under rubble or fearing for their lives amid persistent tremors that have disrupted communication lines across regions including Ehime, Wakayama, Shizuoka and Osaka prefectures which is about 40 miles from Tokyo.

"We're in deep shaking now," said Dr. Yoko Sato of Kyoto University Earth Science Department to CNN affiliate NHK shortly after the first quake struck at around 2:57 AM, before a series of six-second tremors peaked with an additional jolt measuring magnitude eight mere hours later on March 14th that caused further landslides in Shimane Prefecture.

According to local officials quoted by the Kyoto Times newspaper yesterday evening about those stranded, approximately one thousand people are still unaccounted for and it is expected a significant number of displaced citizens will need temporary housing as they await safe access back into their homes which could be days or weeks away. 

"The situation in Shimane Prefecture has deteriorated after yesterday's jolt; we now have reports that landslides blocked major roadways, cutting off towns from vital resources," said Governor Takumi Hosoda of Ehime on March 15th during a press conference with Tokyo officials and experts discussing how to coordinate rescue efforts between the stricken regions.

The governor warned attendees that tremors could continue intermittently, causing additional aftershocks in Kyoto as well while stressing "we are working around-the-clock; our priority is ensuring public safety and getting all people out of harm's way." He went on to say that the state had deployed 50 search teams with specialized equipment including drones, dogs trained for disaster situations, cameras equipped with night vision capabilities as well as heavy machinery capable of removing fallen trees.

"This quake has been devastating; I have never seen anything like it in my lifetime," said Masao Takahashi who lost his wife and daughter during the initial shockwave while working at a small family-owned business on their home's second floor near Kyoto Imperial Palace which collapsed into debris after being struck by both yesterday morning’s earthquake as well as landslides caused
