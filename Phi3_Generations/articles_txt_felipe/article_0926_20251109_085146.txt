A major diplomatic breakthrough has taken place in a high-stakes meeting between Israel and Palestine today at UN headquarters in New York City on November 15th. After weeks of delicate negotiations led by the United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, both sides have come to an agreement regarding security arrangements for Jerusalem as their future capital city within a two-state solution framework.

The meeting took place amidst heightened tensions in recent months with several violent clashes erupting between Israelis and Palestinians around the Gaza Strip following provocative actions by Hamas, such as launching rockets towards Israeli cities earlier this year on October 20th. Despite these flare-ups of hostility which resulted in fatalities among both sides including civilienzes, officials from Israel’s government have been seeking a peaceful resolution to end years of conflict that has claimed thousands of lives and displaced many more throughout the region's history since 1967.

"This agreement is historic," said UN Secretary-General António Guterres as he addressed reporters today about negotiations between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas during which they struck a landmark deal on security arrangements for Jerusalem with potential impacts felt far beyond the region.

Netanyahu remarked that this accord signifies progress towards establishing peace: "We have worked hard to build trust between our two peoples and today, we can say there is no longer an enemy here but a partner." Meanwhile, Abbas expressed hope for Palestine's future freedom stating, “I am optimistic about the establishment of my state.”

Abbas hailed from Gaza City in the Strip which has been under blockade since Hamas took control following Israel’s withdrawal on June 14th last year. The agreement marks a significant step toward fulfilling his dream to establish an independent Palestinian nation, but observers caution that there are still hurdles ahead such as reconciling differences in Israeli and Palestinian demands regarding borders, refugees' status, and settlements around Jerusalem before this deal can become effective.

This landmark agreement comes after years of deadlock between the two sides on these issues which have been among their greatest challenges since decades ago when violence first escalated in 1967 with Israel’s occupation of West Bank territories at that time, including east Jerusalem then part of Palestine and now claimed by both nations as its capital. In recent years however there has been an uptick due to settler activities within these disputed areas where tensions remain high despite numerous failed negotiations throughout the past decades; some experts see today’s deal marking a potential turning point for Middle East politics, while others warn that more work lies ahead before this agreement can be fully realized.

As both sides seek to capitalize on momentum generated by President Trump's efforts at brokering peace talks between them last month involving key regional players including Egypt and Jordan alongside their own representatives - Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz, Palestinian Authority Affairs Minister Riyad al-Malki met during the meeting today with Guterres present. Their agreement calls for cooperation on security measures such as sharing intelligence to combat terrorism in Jerusalem while preserving respective sovereigsy and maintaining freedom of worship at holy sites like Al Aqsa mosque located inside Temple Mount where Muslim worshippers
