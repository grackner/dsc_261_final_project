A severe thunderstCTE Storm in Denver on June 14 caused widespread disruption and power outages across parts of Colorado last Friday evening. The National Weather Service had issued flash flood warnings, but the intense storm quickly escalated beyond expectations when a powerful downburst led to structural collapses and fires in multiple neighborhoods (The Denver Post/AP Photo).

In what many are calling an unprecedented weather event for this time of year, temperatures plummeted while torrential rains soaked the city within hours. The sudden shift from sunshine to storm sent residents scrambling as they sought shelter amid fallen trees and debris on their streets (CNN Meteorologist).

"I never thought a thunderstorm could cause this much damage," remarked Emily Rodriguez, an eyewitness at the affected site in downtown Denver. "It's like we are living through something straight out of 'The Day After Tomorrow.'" 

By late afternoon on June 14th, over 500 homes had lost power with thousands more experiencing service disruptions due to fallen trees and the strain put on local utilities. Emergency crews were working around-the-clock at multiple locations including Aurora, Arvada, Broomfield, Cherry Hills Village, Englewood, Glendale, Golden, Highlands Ranch, Lakewood, Littleton, Northglenn and Wheat Ridge (Denver7).

"We are doing everything we can to restore power as quickly as possible," said a spokesperson for Xcel Energy. The utility company had dispatched crews across 12 counties in Colorado that experienced the storm's wrath, including some of Denver’s most populated neighborhoods (KRDO).

The intense downpour caused flooding at various parks and popular tourist destinations such as Cherry Creek Shopping Center, where water levels reached record highs. The National Weather Service warned that there were still several hours of heavy rain in the forecast with temperatures dropping below freezing overnight (CBS4).

"I was told to never expect another night like this again," said retired Army veteran John Harris, who spent Friday evening at a shelter near his home after losing power and heat. "The storm just kept coming." 

Experts believe that the Denver thunderstorm's strength can be attributed in part to climate change which is increasingly producing more extreme weather events around the world (CNN Meteorologist). With global temperatures rising, a greater percentage of moisture remains stored within our atmosphere making severe precipitation possible.

"We are seeing this happen with alarming frequency," said Dr. Karen Evans, a climate scientist at CSU-Fort Collins and professor in the Department of Atmospheric Science. "It's not an overstatement to say that we need urgent action on mitigating greenhouse gases."

The Colorado Springs Gazette reported similar incidents across various parts of Western States this past weekend, including fires sparked by lightning strikes and heavy downpours causing flash floods. The combination of climate change effects have left many communities reeling (Colorado Springs Gazette). 

As residents continue to pick up the pieces from Denver's storm-induced chaos in early June, city officials are looking into potential
