In a shocking turn of events during Sunday's National Final in Los Angeles, basketball prodigy Michael Johnson was stripped off his national championship trophy for allegedly using performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs), according to the rules governing NCAA sports. The revelation came after an extensive investigation conducted by a team of federal agents who uncovered evidence pointing towards Johnson's involvement in illegal substance use during crucial matches at Madison Square Garden earlier this season, CNN reports on May 20th with official confirmations expected soon from the FBI and NCAA.

As one fan shared their reaction while watching the interview-like video released by officials today: "This is unbelievable! My son idolized Johnson; to hear he cheated feels like a betrayal," they whispered, eyes filled with disappointment as rain poured outside on New York's bustling streets.

Born in the small town of Millersburg, Indiana and raised by single mother Linda Brown, 19-year-independent sports prodigy Johnson rose through ranks quickly thanks to his phenomenal talent for basketball that he inherited from both sides - father who was a retired professional player himself. His high school graduation in June had already turned heads with unmatched performances on the court but nothing could have prepared us all as we watched our nation’s most promising young star get caught red-handed, according to statements made by Johnson's coach and lifelong friend Tom Smithson at Madison Square Garden.

"Michael has always been a dedicated player who strives for excellence," says Coach John Higgins as he addresses the media gathered around him on Sunday morning outside his Manhattan office building, where Michael used to work part-time after practice before heading home every night - an unspoken rule within their close community back in Indiana.

Smithson recalls how they first met at Madison Square Garden nearly six years ago during a local talent showcase organized by the Basketball Association of America (BAA). Since then, Smithson has not only coached Michael through numerous tournaments but also witnessed his growth into an exceptional player respected across divisions.

"It's heartbreaking to see my friend fall from grace so quickly," he says somberly while holding back tears as fans outside continue pouring in - many with similar sentiments echoed by spectators who had followed Johnson’s rise since his high school years: "He was more than just a star player; Michael brought unity and pride to our community."

NCAA rules strictly prohibit the use of banned substances, including steroids or other PEDs as they artificially enhance muscle strength without addressing any underlying conditions causing fatigue in athletes. Johnson’s coach was informed that he found a suspicious pill bottle at his training facility last month and prompted an internal investigation conducted simultaneously by the NCAA's Ethics Advisory Committee, FBI agents who specialize in sports-related cases and former players with prior experience working as referees or officials during matches played on Sundays.

Johnson’s supporters argue that his achievements have not been solely based on natural talent but also hard work; yet it seems nowhere was he willing to divulge the truth about any substance used off-court, which has added fuel to this scandal's fire according to former Olympic champion Patricia Green who competed against Michael Johnson in college back when they shared training sessions regularly: "I
