A study published in The Lancet suggests that eating a diet rich in fruits and vegetables could significantly reduce the risk of heart disease among adults over age 45 by as much as 20%. Researchers gathered data from various clinical trials across Europe involving participants ranging from England to Greece, conducted between January 2018 and December 2decade.

The study followed close on the heels of a recent World Health Organization report highlighting high rates of heart disease globally as one of its most significant health concerns in developed nations like America, Japan, Australia - with alarmingly similar trends seen throughout Europe too. It's worth noting that many European diets are traditionally richer in fruits and vegetables compared to the standard American fare dominated by meat-heavy dishes and processed food options; however, modern lifestyle changes have led health experts worried about a shift towards unhealthy eating habits.

Dr., Susan Carter – leading researcher of dietary influences on heart disease - said during an interview with CNN: "It's quite clear from our findings that consuming more fruits and vegetables can lower blood pressure, improve cholesterol levels significantly which in turn reduces the likelihood for a patient to suffer severe cardiovascular events." She further added on what measures should be taken by governments worldwide: "It's high time public health initiatives start promoting nutritional awareness amongst citizens at large. Incorporating this knowledge into school curriculums would provide our future generations with an understanding of how essential dietary choices are in maintaining overall wellness."

A prominent chef from Italy, known for his Mediterranean cuisine - Alessandro Rossi shared a similar sentiment during the study's launch event. He expressed concern about changing eating patterns: "In my country alone (Italy), where traditional recipes passed down through generations were once largely plant-based meals like pasta primavera or Minestrone soup filled with fresh vegetables, I see nowadays more and more youngsters preferring fast food over homecooked delights."

Dr. Peter Clarke - an Australian cardiologist who works closely on heart disease cases emphasizes the need for dietary changes in Australia as well: "Australians love their barbeques but it might be time to reconsider how often they choose red meat-laden meals over more wholesome options."

Moving forward, experts like Dr. Carter hope these findings will catalyze a shift towards healthier lifestyles and influence national dietary guidelines globally - promoting fruitful changes in the food industry too which can help curb this alarming rise of heart disease around us today due largely to poor nutrition choices; thereby saving lives across nations worldwide.
