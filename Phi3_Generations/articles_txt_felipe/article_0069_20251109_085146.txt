In a landmark decision on Thursday evening at their state capitol in Austin, Texas legislators voted overwhelmingly to ban trans fats from all food establishments within the next two years as part of an aggressive public health campaign aimed at combating heart disease. The bill was passed with 85% support among lawmner and is expected to save tens of thousands of Texans annually in medical costs related to cardiovascular issues attributed to trans fat consumption, according to experts cited by the Texas Tribune.

The ban has been widely hailed as a major win for public health advocates who have campaigned tirelessly against processed foods containing harmful fats that pose risks not only to heart disease but also obesity and diabetes rates in the state, which currently rank among the highest in America.

"The passage of this legislation is a testament to our collective commitment towards making healthier choices for ourselves and future generations," said Dr. Maria Fernandez-Cruz, chairwoman of the Texas Food Industry Association (TFIA), adding she expected widespread compliance from member businesses within six months following passage at this session's close next March 10th.

Official transcript released by state rep John Smith said: "This historic vote sends an unequivocal message that the health and well-being of our citizens comes first, above all else." He also claimed TFIA estimates upwards $5 billion will be invested in reformulating recipes across industry members during this period as they phase out use trans fats.

Representatives for restaurant owners have expressed their support but voiced concerns over the cost of switching to healthier oil alternatives, saying businesses would see a rise in costs by approximately $1 per meal while maintaining current pricing structures which many believe already make them more expensive than average menus nationwide.

"Though we welcome this change wholeheartedly as beneficial for our customers' health and long-term sustainability of the industry, it is important to recognize these unforeseen costs may put us at a disadvantage when competing with chains in other states where such bans are not yet implemented," said Sarah Ochoa representing local restaurant group Happily Ever Diner based out New Orleans Louisiana.

However critics of the bill argue that while trans fat removal is essential, it's crucial to also educate consumers on reading labels for saturated fats and maintain balance in diets along with making healthier choices when possible as a part holistic lifestyle approach towards tackling these issues head-on.

Dr Rachel Taylor from Dent Health Center who specializes nutrition commented: "It's important not to demonize specific food groups or oils since our body requires certain fats like Omega 3 fatty acs for optimal functioning while also acknowledging where trans fats have no business being included."

Following the vote, activists from organizations including Center for Science in Rural Living voiced support and reiterated their ongoing campaign of informative workshops across state capitols to raise awareness about nutrition issues. "We applaud this significant step forward but must continue our efforts ensuring all Texans understand how they can make informed decisions for a balanced diet," said Lila Harris from CSRL based out Dallas Texas and coordinator of their recent workshop series on health
