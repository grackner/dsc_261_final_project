Residents in New York City woke up to a nighttime skyline illuminated with red and blue lights as part of an experimental sleep therapy program for individuals suffering from severe insomnia and other sleep disorders, which was launched yesterday evening by the city's leading medical institutions. The unusual project took place at multiple hospitals across Manhattan where specialists are using a combination of light therapy and sound to alter brainwave patterns in an attempt to induce different states of consciousness beneficial for healthy sleep cycles or treating certain disorders like PTSD, which is often associated with nightmares.

Several hundred participants who have reportedly been struggling with chronic insomnia participated voluntarily as part of the one-month pilot program conducted by Staten Island University Hospital and Mount Sinai Medical Center in partnership with sleep experts from Harvard University School of Medicine, which concluded its initial run last night after a 30-day trial period.

"I am glad that I finally found something outside medication to help my insomnia," said Jennifer Smith (not her real name), one participant who was among the first hundred people taking part in this avant-garde approach known as 'biohacking'. "For two years, nothing worked until a few months ago when someone mentioned light therapy. The doctors explained how it can reset our body's internal clock and that I decided to give it try."

According to the program outline provided by Dr. Emily Wilson (not her real name), Director of Sleep Medicine at Staten Island University Hospital, participants are exposed daily from 7pm until bedtime with a combination of colored light therapy under individualized settings tailored for each person's specific issues and custom-engineered sounds designed to calm the mind before sleep.

"The aim is not just about getting people to fall asleep but also ensuring they have high quality REM (Rapid Eye Movement) restorative phases, which are crucial in memory consolidation," Dr. Wilson said during her presentation on Monday night ahead of the program launch day where she stressed that this is not an alternative treatment for those who simply need a bit more shuteye but particularly beneficial as part of comprehensive therapies like cognitive behavioral techniques, which already have proven to be effective in improving sleep disorders.

The sounds used range from low-frequency white noise with subtle harmonic undertones produced by specialized software that has been developed after collaboration between NYU Langone Medical Center and Columbia University's Neuropsychology Department as part of the ongoing research into neural modulation techniques for enhancing sleep quality.

"Our preliminary data is showing some really promising results," said Dr. Jonathan Lee (not his real name), a leading neuropsychologist working with NYU Langone Medical Center and Columbia University in this project, adding that most participants reported significantly improved sleep duration as well increased deep wave activity after only two nights of the program compared to baseline measurements taken beforehand where no significant changes were detected.

Despite initial positive feedback from first few days into the pilot study's second week when people started mentioning not just falling back asleep faster but also waking up feeling more refreshed and less anxious during their daily routine, some sleep experts in attendance have raised concerns about long-term effects of this kind if therapy without any established scientific consensus.

"In the end it comes down to safety,"
