Topic: Health - Sleep

It's been a month since sleep researchers at Johns Hopkins University released startling statistics: nearly half of Americans are not getting enough shut-eye each night to stay healthy and productive, according to the National Sleep Foundation’s guidelinfluence. Experts estimate that by 2025, this issue could lead to an economic loss exceeding $31 trillion globally as a result of diminished workforce performance and increased healthcare costs for chronic sleep-deprivation related conditions such as heart disease and diabetes (American Journal of Health Promotion).

Lead by Dr. Sarah Johnson, the Johns Hopkins study found that on average adults require between 7 to 9 hours of quality sleep per night but were clocking in at only about six or seven hours each night across all age groups and demographics (Sleep Medicine Reviews Journal). “The consequences are dire,” Dr. Johnson states, emphasizing the critical nature of this public health concern.

Dr. Paul Martinez – a sleep psychologist from Harvard Medical School who wasn't part of Johns Hopkins’ study - notes that while genetics and other factors can affect an individual's ability to fall asleep or stay awake, most people suffer due primarily because their lifestyle doesn't accommodate the needs for ample rest. “In today's 24/7 society,” he tells CNN Health in a telephone interview on Tuesday (April 15th), "it’s essential to understand how much sleep we need and make conscious efforts towards achieving it.”

Furthermore, the study indicates that technology plays an enormous role; screen time before bed has been shown by experts like Dr. Jessica Thompson at St. Mary's Hospital in London (Sleep Health Journal) to interfere with our body’s natural sleep-wake cycle or circadian rhythm through exposure to blue light emitted from devices such as phones and laptops just before bedtime which stimulates alertness rather than promoting relaxation leading us closer into an alluring but ultimately harmful screen addiction trap.

With growing concern about the sleep crisis, President Joe Biden addressed this issue in a recent address to Congress where he acknowledged that "the United States must prioritize improving work-life balance as part of our national effort for wellness," adding his endorsement towards policies aimed at reducing working hours without compromising productivity (White House Press Release, March 15th).

Dr. Martinez sees this commitment from leadership "as positive progress and hopefully encourages changes within companies to make such initiatives a standard practice." However, he warns that it is not enough alone as employees also need education about proper sleep hygiene – including setting consistent bedtimes while reducing exposure of blue light before slumber time - for these efforts towards improved rest periods among Americans take hold effectively.

Moving forward to next steps being taken by various stakeholders, Johns Hopkins University's research team plans on expanding their work into policy recommendations geared toward public awareness campaigns aimed at promoting better sleep habits while also working with technology companies towards developing more conscious user interfaces that minimize blue light exposure when not needed during the evening hours.

In response to these findings, many employers are already making changes in their organizations such as flexible schedules and paid time off for employees seeking treatment of conditions exac
