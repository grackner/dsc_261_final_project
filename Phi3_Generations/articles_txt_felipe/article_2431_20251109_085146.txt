A recent study published in The Lancet provides groundbreinig for new treatment strategies against Alzheimer's disease through gene therapy. Researchers at Johns Hopkins University have found a way to introduce healthy genes into the brain of mice with models that display symptoms similar to human dementia, effectively reversing these conditions without adverse side effects in this model group as reported on December 12th by The Lancet.

The study's lead researcher Dr. Sarah Connor stated, "We have been working towards finding a cure for Alzheimer’s disease using gene therapy techniques and are thrilled with the results we see today." Further into their work at Baltimore-based facility in November 2023, they noted that mice subjected to this treatment exhibited significant improvement in cognitive function.

Dr. Connor's lab partner Dr. Jack Harper added insight saying: "Our team believes we are on the cusp of a revolutionary shift in how Alzheimer’s is treated, offering hope where there was little before." The therapy used has now entered into phase I clinical trials at Massachusetts General Hospital to determine safety and efficacy for human subjects.

Researchers anticipate results within six months from the trial's commencement on January 20th. Dr. Connor reflects, "While we celebrate this progress today, our work continues as there is still a long road ahead." Alzheimer’s Disease International has shown support in funding further research alongside academic institutions globally to expand the study's reach and refine its application for human treatment.
