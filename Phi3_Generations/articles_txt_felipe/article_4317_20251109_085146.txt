Dramatic rescue unfolding in Maldives as boat capsizes off Male' capital coastline with tourists onboard; authorities deploy sea turtles and drones to locate survivors amidst rough weather conditions (CNN) — May 2, 2024. As the tropical sun set over the picturesque islands of the Maldives this evening, a distress call changed from routine holiday fun into an urgent search for life at sea just off Male'.

A family on vacation went out in their private yacht around noon local time but found themselves battling rough seas by late afternoon. The boat capsized approximately 5 kilometers (3 miles) north of the capital, triggering a multifaceted search and rescue operation involving Maldives National Defense Force cutters as well as special operations teams equipped with cutting-edge technology to help them find survivors in time for nightfall.

"Our primary concern is ensuring everyone onboard remains safe while we coordinate an effective response," said Lieutenant Commander Moosa Ahmed, commanding officer of a Navy patrol boat deployed from the main island Male', known locally as 'Veeru'. "We're relying heavily on our sea turtles and drones to navigate these treacherous waters tonight."

In recent years, trained loggerheads have been employed in search-and extrication missions following maritime accidents due to their ability to withstand harsh ocean conditions. A pair of rescue divers is on standby aboard one of the boats for a potential manual recovery if necessary after drones and sea turtles fail, as per protocol established by Maldives' search-and-rescue force (SARF).

The United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs has offered satellite assistance to improve visibility during this adverse weather event. "With a combination of our advanced earth observation satellites and ground surveillance radars, we can offer an accurate position fix even in challenging conditions," stated Dr. Anushka Singh, Head of Remote Sensing at UNOSA's Maldives branch office on Villingli Seyroodhoo island around 5 km from Male'.

With visibility down to just a few meters due to heavy rain and swells estimated between three and four meters high according to local weather experts, the operation faces considerable challenges. The UNOSA satellite imagery will be crucial in tracking this unfolding story night-after-night until survivors are found or bodies recovered by the national grief support committee after recovery operations conclude on June 15th, marking one month since incident date of May 2nd – a significant time for Maldives' traumatized family.

A local resident who witnessed initial distress calls said: "It started raining hard around three o'clock and the waves grew like crazy quickly; I thought we were all gonna die!" She recalls hearing about survivors in life jackets being seen briefly by drones before they got lost beneath water.

Residents of Male', which was not directly affected but understands well their Maldives brothers and sisters' pain, are praying for a swift resolution to this ongoing tragedy as the international community watches events unfold with bated breath across oceans far from home islands in South Asia.
