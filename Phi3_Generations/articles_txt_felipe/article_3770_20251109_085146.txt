A massive fire broke out in an old building housing multiple guest rooms in Downtthy last night around midnight local time, forcing hundreds of guests to evacuate and leaving a handful injured. The downtown hotel on Smith Avenue caught the attention when smoke billowed through its windows shortly before 12:30 AM ET (midnight) yesterday evening as emergency crews arrived at the scene just after midnight with full sirens blaring from their vehicles, echoing throughout a usually quiet neighborhood.

“The fire department responded to our alarm clocks about half an hour ago,” said hotel guest Sarah Jones while standing outside her room awaiting further instruction on what would happen next and when she might return home. “We're all just trying not to panic.”

As crews worked together in the cold, rain-drenched streets of Downtthy yesterday evening, they focused their efforts near where guests were still being gathered for possible relocation while waiting instructions from hotel management or emergency services personnel if that was an option. The downtown fire station is normally filled with calls about once a day but received nearly 15 in just under four hours as flames quickly spread through the building, trapping many of its occupants inside before they could escape on their own and forcing rescuers to brave freezing water temperatures while cutting holes into floors above.

“This was an intense fire unlike anything we've seen before,” said Chief Fire Marshal James Martin during a press conference held later this morning at the downtown station alongside Mayor Anna Rodriguez, who thanked crews for their bravery and professionalism in handling such a dangerous situation under less-than ideal conditions. “We had an elderly couple that passed away inside because of smoke inhalation,” he said after touring the damage firsthand with officials before heading back to command his team at Station 42 on Elm Street just blocks from where fire raged through what was once a popular hotel for visitors and families alike.

The blaze, which originated in room 305 according to witnesses who said they heard the couple yelling for help but saw no one inside prior to emergency services personnel entering their doorway; began after guests had gone downstairs from dinner service around seven o'clock last night when smoke started billowing out of a bedroom window at approximately eight PM local time. The elderly woman, who suffered mild injuries and was taken by ambulance to the nearest hospital with trauma services just moments before news spread about this incident began in what appeared to be an act meant as revenge against family members for unpaid debts—according to a 35-year old witness standing outside her home at East Park Avenue across from where firefighters were spotted working tirelessly trying not only to put out flames but also search every floor above this one while maintaining communication with loved ones through the intercom system still in place within each guest room.

“I couldn't believe what I was seeing until about half an hour ago when we heard someone calling for help,” said another neighbor, Mike Harris who told reporters his wife works downstairs as a server while he watched from their living room window across the street after walking over at approximately 12:30 AM local time. “We're all shocked and worried about our loved ones in there.”
