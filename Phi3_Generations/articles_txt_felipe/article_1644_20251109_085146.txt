In a striking display of collaboration between artists and local law enforcement in New York City's Times Square this weekend, an art installation created by six street performers known as The Mime Collective has gained significant attention from passersby and social media users alike. Situated at the iconic intersection on Saturday evening (April 5), between Broadway and Seventh Avenue, the mimes used their silent acts to draw awareness about environmental issues without uttering a single word.

The Mime Collective consists of six talented performers: Jasmine Lee, Carlos Ramirez, Fiona Chen, Omar Akbar, Bella Rossi, and Yun-Hee Kim. They came together spontaneously after meeting at an open mic night in Chelsea several months prior but had never attempted such a grand scale artistic endeavor before this event. The silent spectacle drew hundreds of onlookers who were not only captivated by the performers' expressive gestures and face paintings, reflecting various environmental concerns – deforestation, ocean pollution, endangered species - but also began discussions around these issues online in real-time as audiences shared photos and videos on social media platforms.

"Our aim is to create awareness through art without using any words," explained Carlos Ramirez during their set break while they practiced before the installation's official debut. "We hope that our silent performance inspires people to reflect upon these global issues and take action." Jasmine Lee, one of The Mime Collective members added: "As mimes, we believe silence speaks volumes - it allows us to connect more deeply with emotions associated with complex topics like environmental degradation. We want our message not just heard but felt too."

The Times Square art installation is scheduled for future performances every weekend starting this Saturday until May 31st at the same location and time, inviting even larger crowds to witness their silent spectacle each week as word about The Mime Collective continues spreading.
