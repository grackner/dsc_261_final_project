A basketball star from New York City is facing a rare off-court struggle with mental health issues that have left fans concerned and supportive campaigners advocating for awareness of psychological well-being among professional athletes in the industry, reports CNN on Tuesday. The player sought treatment after experiencing severe anxiety over several months which impacted their performance during a national basketball tournament held earlier this month at Madison Square Garden.

Kevin Richardson is 32 and has been one of New York's top players for the last decade, winning two championships with the city’s famed Knicks team in 2014 before moving on to play professionally overseas until his recent return to the United States. His friends describe him as a hardworking individual who is not only committed offensively and defensively but also takes pride in being part of community initiatives, such as mentoring young basketball players at local schools around New York City's borough parks where he frequently practices his game skills on the court with them.

Richardson’s anxiety began during late summer when personal issues started to surface from an unsettled relationship and stressful working conditions that required him traveling back and forth between cities for games, tournaments, or even training sessions overseas every two weeks throughout a hectic schedule demanding constant focus on performance.

“I didn’t realize how much pressure I was under until things started to spill out,” Richardson confessed when asked about his mental state before seeking help from sports psychologists specializing in anxiety and depression at the Madison Square Garden clinic where he received treatment this month, as per those familiar with him. "I couldn't sleep well or eat properly because of these fears that something bad might happen next time I stepped on court."

According to his former teammate from Europe who recently had dinner together in New York City before Richardson’s return home: “Kevin is a great guy, always has been. His commitment and love for basketball goes beyond just playing the game – he's genuinely passionate about it,” said Jamal Douglas, a 28-year old forward who joined him at dinner last Friday night where they exchanged thoughts on various aspects of their profession while reminiscing some good memories with laughter.

Basketball players around the world have long battled mental health challenges due to intense physical demands and public scrutiny, but Richardson's openness about seeking help for anxiety has garnered appreciation from fans who believe this conversation could bring significant change in how professional athletes handle their psychological well-being. 

Dr. Maria Gonzales, a licensed therapist working with sports teams across the country including Richardson’s Knicks team recently told CNN Sports that: "It's crucial for people to understand anxiety and stress are common among professional athletes since they face enormous pressure not just on court but also in their personal lives." She added, “Sometimes these issues can be so severe leading players like Richardson seeking help is the right decision as long as there isn’t a stigma attached.”

Richardson hopes his experience will encourage more athletes to seek mental health support without feeling embarrassed or ashamed. He says that if he could change something about this industry, it would be creating an environment where people realize they are not alone in struggling with psychological issues - whether on or off court – and seeking help is perfectly
