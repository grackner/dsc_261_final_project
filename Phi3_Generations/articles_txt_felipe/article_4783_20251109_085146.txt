A federal judge in New York City recently sentenced a notorious local gang leader to ten years imprisonment for his involvement in multiple high-stakes criminal activities spanning over two decranes. Richard Gomez, the defendant, was charged with several counts of money laundering and racketeering after federal authorities discovered illicit financial transactions amounting to approximately $10 million funneled through legitimate business enterprises in Miami and New York City between 2015 and 2017.

The case, which drew widespread media attention due to the scale of Gomez's operations as well as his alleged connections with other criminal organizations across different states such as Texas, has now come to a close after federal authorities closed in on him following an investigation that took nearly three years to complete.

Gomez’s lawyer tried unsuccessfully at sentencing to argue for probation or home confinement due to Gomez's family responsibilities and charitable contributions, but U.S. District Judge Robert Scola Jr. denied the request citing concerns about future criminal behavior by his client once released from prison: “The evidence against Mr. Gomez is overwhelming; he must be held accountable for all of these crimes.”

In addition to a 10-year sentence, federal authorities imposed fines totaling $5 million on the business entities involved in laundering illicit funds through various legitimate companies. According to U.S. Attorney Lawrence Haley from New York's Southern District of New York (SDNY), this significant financial penalty aims not only at deterring Gomez and his associates, but also ensuring that no more criminals benefit from money laundering: “We hope our actions send the message loud and clear to anyone else who might be involved in similar crimes—we will always seek justice.”

One key witness for federal authorities was former associate of Gomez's gang member, Maria Fernandez. In her statement before Judge Scola Jr.'s court on Monday afternoon at Foley Square Courthouse, she described how she had worked alongside the defendant in a cleaning business they shared with other criminals during which illicit money was laundered through their establishment: “I never imagined that such greedy people could be so sneaky. They would come to work dirty and leave without even touching my hands, while I had done all the hard work for them.”

Fernandez’s story played a vital role in securing Gomez's conviction as federal prosecutors were able to tie him directly to these criminal activities. Although she willingly testified against her former colleague and received immunity from charges herself, Fernandez expressed regret for having been exploited by the gang: “It’s a horrible feeling of betrayal when I realized they had me work like that all this time; my conscience has been eating at me ever since.”

Fernandez's family will be able to take custody of her two young children while she serves her sentence. The 28-year-old mother, who grew up in the same apartment building where Gomez had his hideout years ago with other gang members and drug addicts, said that despite being aware at some point back then about their criminal activities nearby, things never made sense to her as she was always too young.
