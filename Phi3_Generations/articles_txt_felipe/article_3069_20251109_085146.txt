Amid escalating tensions in South Sudan's capital of Juba, government forces and armed opposition members have been engaged in sporadic fighting for nearly two weeks now. The conflict reportedly began over disputes surrounding oil revenue sharing on June 10th, but quickly turned into a full-blown clash as opposing factions vie for control amidst the country'ged fragile stability after years of civil strife that resulted in an estimated death toll surpassing half a million people.

At least six civilians have been killed and dozens more injured since fighting erupted near Juba airport, just outside the city center where thousands displaced by violence are currently seeking shelter on nearby rooftops or in overcrowded makeshift camps as of June 18th. The United Nations has expressed deep concern for those affected and warned that without a swift resolution to hostilities, the situation could worsen rapidly with dire consequences ahead — echoing concerns raised by South Sudanese officials last year when violence initially erupted in December 2013 amid allegations of political power struggles within President Kiir's government.

"This is a very serious development that we cannot afford to ignore," said UN Secretary-General António Guterres during an emergency conference call with representatives from the African Union and regional leaders last weekend in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia — where he pledged continued international support for efforts aimed at deescalating conflicts across Sudan's embattled region.

A spokesperson for South Africa-based peacebuilding organization International Crisis Group stated that a "critical window" remains open to bring about lasting solutions through negotiations before violence continues unabated with catastrophic humanitarian impact; adding, however: 

“The situation in Juba is extremely fluid and we are monitoring the evolving dynamics closely. In recent days, there have been some positive signs of dialogue between government representatives from both sides taking place behind closed doors at UNMISS (United Nations Mission in South Sudan) compound — raising hopes that a ceasefire could soon be brokered before further bloodshed ensues."

Despite these recent indications, no immediate peace agreement seems forthcoming as President Kiir and Vice President Taban Deng Gai have yet to publicly commit themselves towards meaningful dialogue. As of now, the Juba conflict remains a precarious situation in which international diplomatic efforts must continue unabated alongside urgent humanitarian support needed by thousands directly affected within South Sudan's capital alone — as well an emerging refugee crisis spreading across its border with Uganda where more than 17,000 people have fled to seek safety in the last three weeks.

The fighting has taken a heavy toll on Juba infrastructure including roads and communication lines; compounding difficulties already faced by nearly half of South Sudan's population living below the poverty line with limited access to healthcare services, clean water supplies or adequate housing — as noted in last year’s UN Human Development Report.

"It is an unimaginable reality for so many," said Dr. Mariam Yadaw Jallow MBChB FRCPCH FPHMF (President of Sudanese Medical Association) during a phone interview while observing patient conditions amidst limited resources at the main referral hospital in Bor on June 1
