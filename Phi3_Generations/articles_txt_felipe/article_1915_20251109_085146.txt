In a stunning turn of events at last night's NHL game between the Boston Bruins and Philadelphia Flyers in TD Garden on February 20th, defenseman John Anderson from Boston scored an unexpected goal during stoppage time with just five minutes remaining to alter what appeared to be a foregone conclusion. The crowd of over ten thousand fans watched intently as their team's defense began its shift, only then did the young player make his move on puck carelessly left unguarded by Philadelphia defenseman Mike Brooks and slip past all four Flyers goalie legs in one swift motion to secure a much-nedependent victory.

Having been an overlooked Boston rookie for two seasons, Anderson's sudden rise from obscurity has the hockey community buzzing with speculation about his future prospects. "It was like he found lightning," exclaimed Bruins coach Chris Taylor in disbelief during a post-game interview broadcast live on CNN Sport Network at 10:45 PM EST, as fans erupted into cheers from the stands and celebrated Anderson's unprecedented play of skill.

Anderson has never received much attention since joining Boston three years ago despite having been drafted by a lower-league team before his current stint with The Bruins; however, this game changed everything for him instantly as he displayed such raw talent rarely seen in rookies from the AHL. "It's an incredible opportunity," said Anderson to reporters afterwards while still at TD Garden surrounded by cheering fans and press personnel trying to keep their questions brief due to constant interruptions of celebratory Bruins supporters who refused any discussion on team tactics or strategy used in the game.

Philadelphia Flyers' coach Dan Snyder was not so easily dissuaded, as he remained optimistic about his team despite being down 3-0 with less than ten minutes of playtime left and admitted that Anderson has potential to become a strong asset for Boston moving forward but warned the rookie against overconfidence. "John's performance tonight was special," Snyder told reporters in an interview at Wells Fargo Center just after final horn sounded marking game end with scores of 4-1; he added, however: "As a coach I must say that there are still more things for our young player to learn on the path ahead."

Fans who attended yesterday's Bruins victory were overjoyed by Anderson’s performance and anticipation grows as his next appearance against Montreal Canadiens scheduled later this month could see him repeating history, given how close Boston was trailing 1-0 with just minutes left until stoppage time. Fans eagerly await to know if the young defenseman from New Hampshire can replicate yesterday’s incredible feat in front of millions tuning into Sunday evening NHL action at TD Garden where he will face Canadiens rookie Alec Richards; Anderson remains focused on improving with each opportunity, but his fans and teammates continue to celebrate a much-needed victory for the hometown Bruins.

Anderson's remarkable start has drawn attention from other major hockey leagues in Canada as he was overlooked by some scouts earlier this season while attending college at University of Vermont where his coach, Mark Higgins commented on Anderson’s potential: "John is a force to be reckoned with once you get past the hype."
