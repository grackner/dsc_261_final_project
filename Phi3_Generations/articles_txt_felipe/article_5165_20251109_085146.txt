CBS has announced it will be considering a new host for its reality television show "Survive the Wilderness" after viewership numbers reportedly plummeted by nearly half since last season. The series, which features contestants challenging themselves in various extreme environments around the globe to test their survival skills and adaptability while being judged on resilience against both nature's elements and interpersonal dynamics, premiered its latest installment live from Brazilian rainforests with former NFL star quarterback Derek J. Thompson as host for what was supposed to be a high-energy show that would bring fresh excitement back into the reality TV landscape according to producers.

However, during this season's debut last month, which saw its 15th episode air on Thursday evenings with anticipated ratings of over four million per night, viewers tuned in much less frequently than expected — CBS has not released specific numbers but sources claiming they were "significantly lower." In a statement issued Monday afternoon from the network's Los Angeles studio where executives are said to be reviewing potential changes following this season’thalfway point with 50 episodes left, head of programming for reality TV at CBS David Greene stated that while numbers have been disappointing and there was initially no decision made yet by today.

A source close to the production team tells us: "It's not all doom and gloom though! We are making progress - we found out some contestants really enjoy being on-screen, which gives me hope for future seasons."  Meanwhile a former reality star who competed in previous installments of Survive has voiced concerns about potential changes.

"If they bring someone else back as the host or even if it's just an alteration to his persona - I worry that will take away from what made this show great," said Jessica Lee, a former contestant and reality television analyst who was part of two prior seasons on "Survive."

Greene has been vocal about CBS wanting not only survival skills but also charisma at the helm. He told reporters last week during an industry event in Las Vegas that he had discussed potential changes with Thompson, and while declining to comment further specifically stating they are taking their time considering options due to high stakes involved: "The ratings matter because we invest a lot of money into each season; therefore it's worth discussing. However, at the end of day I want our show to continue delivering thrilling experiences."

CBS also plans new episodes featuring different challenges and environments like Antarctica next week while still trying figure out potential host changes for subsequent seasons as per one insider in New York who requested anonymity due to ongoing discussions. 

"We want the show back up-and-running with fresh excitement; however, we also need viewers watching at home," said Greene after Monday's meeting where executives and producers discussed next steps while continuing filming in South American rainforests for episode #51 set to air live on Thursday evenings.
