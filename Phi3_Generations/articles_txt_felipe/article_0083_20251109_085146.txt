In a stunning upset at Saturday's NCAA Division I-AA national championship game in Atlanta, Alcorn State General Bulldogs fell to an unprecedented powerhouse quarterback from the University of Montana named Marcus Johnson who threw for over 500 yards and ran into Super Bowl history. The win by Big Sky representatives marked a rare victory against lower tier teams as they advance towards their first national title appearance since 1987, with head coach Rick Tennant in disbelief at the turn of events, "I never saw this coming," he said during post-game celebrations.

Marcus Johnson started his remarkable career last season when Alcorn State was ranked among top tier Division I programs but suffered a loss to smaller schools on their home turf against teams such as Samford and Southern Miss in the FCS playoffs, where they were defeated twice by opponents with losing records like Chattanooga Red Wolves. His performance had been nothing short of spectacular before this game; Johnson threw for 427 yards at a conference championship loss to Weber State on November 15th and set up the most anticipated matchup in Division I-AA history against Alcorn State's team, where he ran into trouble during his first interception.

Despite being undefeated with two wins already this season (both came via shutouts) at times seeming to be a lock for another win over the Bulldogs; on Saturday afternoon though, it all changed when Johnson and Alcorn State's defense could not hold off his unstoppable march downfield. "We played hard against them," admitted Big Sky quarterback Alex Rodriguez afterward, but conceded that they just couldn't contain Marcus Johnson’s speedy legs on the ground or in the air as he completed 27 out of 35 passes for a total gain of over half-a-century with several touchdown strikes.

Marcus Johnson also rushed for an impressive seventeen yards, which was not his primary goal but helped boost Alcorn State’s offense when they were struggling in the final five minutes to stay competitive before succumbing 38–21 on a day where over one hundred students and fans of both schools gathered together at Bobby Dodd Stadium. Both teams will reflect deeply, with NCAA officials stating there has been no violations or controversies surrounding this matchup that would warrant investigation; however Alcorn State's assistant head coach Jason Smith expressed his team disappointment saying, "We had an opportunity to win and unfortunately lost out on it."

This unexpected defeat marks a turning point in both programs as they prepare for their next seasons. Marcus Johnson is set to transfer to Division I-A with the intention of playing at that level where he believes even greater opportunities await him; his coach, Tim Smith agreed stating "Marcus has worked tirelessly this season and it's a shame we didn’t get another chance." Alcorn State players are already working harder than ever on their recruiting efforts for next fall as they attempt to regain some of the lost ground.

The NFL draft is fast approaching, where Johnson may be one to watch out if his performance holds up; meanwhile Big Sky University head coach Rick Tennant said he will continue to refine strategies and tactics with each defeat or win moving forward in order not to fall prey again like this time. The College Football Playoff committee is taking note of Alcorn State's recent upset, which
