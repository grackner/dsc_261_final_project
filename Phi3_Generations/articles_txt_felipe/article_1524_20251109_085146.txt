In a quiet town on Long Island's North Shore, guests at an exclusive country retreat woke up to find their accommodations transformed into something straight out of Downtenzilla movies - complete with plastic replicas and tacky decor that quickly became the talk of social media. The Green Meadows Inn introduced its new "Summer Camp Experience" on May 20th, aiming to bring fun for families staying in a region known more for pristine beaches than roller coasters; however, guests and tourism experts are not amused by the blatant gimmick.

The "Summer Camp Experience" promised children an escape into nature with activities such as horseback riding through lush green fields at Sunrise Stables (7 miles away), canoeing on Lake Breeze, and campfires under starlit skies — but the sight of inflatable dinosaurs decorating hallways instead left some families feeling disillusioned.

"We were excited about a family-friendly staycation with our kids," said Maria Rodriguez from Queens who spent last Sunday at Green Meadows Inn with her two young children, "but seeing those fake animals and plastic tents just took away the magic of summer camp we had all been anticipating."

Guests were greeted by a reception area that resembled Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory, complete with life-size replicas of popular children’s characters like Barbie and Lightning McQueen. The "Campfire Grill," an LED screen displaying animated cartoons instead of crackling firelight, failed to capture the warmth or ambiance that a real campfire provides according to some attendees:

"It felt more eerie than cozy; I don't think my kids will ever be excited about fires again," commented David Chen.

Local businesses that traditionally catered towards families are worried about Green Meadows Inn’s attempt damaging the area’s image as a family-friendly destination, with one owner expressing concern: “We've always had kids flock to our annual ice cream social because it offers something nostalgic and genuine. This summer camp experience is nothing like that."

The inn management responded in an emailed statement from General Manager Robert Hanson on May 25th, defending the project: "We aimed for a unique staycation option – to bring fun into families’ getaways," he said adding it was never meant as anything more than lighthearted entertainment.

The news of Green Meadows Inn's Summer Camp Experience has sparked debate among travel bloggers, locals and family-based tourism experts alike; some are calling for a boycott while others defend the property’s creative approach to vacationing: "It was definitely not what I expected from an upscale retreat – but it seems like there's still time on Saturday night when they offer complimentary real-life campfires and stargaz
