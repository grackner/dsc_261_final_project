As a leading national pollster releases its latest survey on Wednesday morning, it shows former Vice President Joe Biden with an unprecedented lead in battleground states ahead of the upcoming election day next Tuesday (October 30). The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research conducted a phone poll that reveals significant support across key swing regions.

In Michigan, which held its early voting last Saturday with about half of eligible voters participating, Biden has captured approximately 52% of the vote share while his opponent, President Donald Trump, is trailing by just over five percentage points at around 47%. The margin in Arizona—a state that also saw a substantial turnout for early voting last Sunday with roughly one-quarter of potential voters cast their ballots ahead of election day this Friday—has Biden leading slightly more comfortably at about 53%, compared to Trump' endorsing around 46%.

This comes as the race tightens further in crucial battlegrounds such as Pennsylvania, where early voting is underway with nearly a third of potential voters having participated last Tuesday. Here too Biden trails by only two percentage points at about 50%, against Trump's around-the-clock campaign promises to make victory his own on election day next week.

“We’re seeing an energized Democrat base and a more motivated Republican one,” says pollster Mary Poulsen, who conducted the AP survey in Michigan. “The question is which will bring out their voters at polling sites.” 

In Pennsylvania on Thursday last week about two million people voted early; an all-time record for that state's most populous county of Philadelphia alone with around a quarter of its population voting, per the Pew Research Center. While in North Carolina—a battleground where nearly one out of every five registered voters already cast their ballots through mail or at polling sites last Monday as well, Biden is leading by about 49% to Trump's approximately 47%.

The latest AP-NORC poll shows that the race for president will likely be decided on election night in battleground states. While these findings are based solely on preliminary early voting data and may not predict results accurately, they indicate a continued national interest as Election Day draws nearer next weekend. With all 50 U.S. senators having been elected already back in November of the previous year when Biden was chosen vice president by former President Barack Obama—and now two years later with an even more closely contested race for commander-in-chief, American democracy will once again be put to test as a new administration is shaped and its impact felt across local communities nationwide.

“It's hard not to get excited about the possibilities ahead,” says political analyst Derek Cohen in an interview with CNN Political Insider this morning regarding early voting data trends which he suggests show voters continue taking their voices seriously even after weeks of campaigning rhetoric and advertisements. “This is a historic moment for American politics.”

As millions are expected to head to polling places across the nation next Friday, there will be heightened security measures in place on Election Day with increased presence from law enforcement agencies throughout voting sites—many of which have extended their hours into Saturday as well. The federal government has also taken steps by deploying additional postal service workers and expanding mail
