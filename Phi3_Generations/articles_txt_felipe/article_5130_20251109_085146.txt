In a daring heist that has left authorities baffled and local residents on edge, an estimated $2 million worth of artwork was reported stolen from the Smithson Art Museum in New York City yesterday evening. According to reports by NYPD spokeswoman Detective Maria Rodriguez, no suspects have been apprehended as investigators continue their search for leads across multiple states where buyers might attempt resale transactions (New York - Last night).

The theft unfolded during an exclusive gala at the Smithson Art Museum celebrating contemporary American art. Security cameras captured a masked figure entering through a back entrance shortly after closing time, which was around 8 PM local time on Thursday evening. Witnesses report seeing shadows flitting past security checkpoints just minutes before and immediately following lockdown announcements (New York - Smithson Art Museum).

"It's unlike anything we have encountered in the art community," says Chief of Police James Harrison, who has promised a full team response to assist New York State Troopers. "Our priority is restoring this precious work back into public view and bringing those responsible for these actions to justice."

The stolen pieces included works by prominent local artists such as Elizabeth Grant' endowed with cultural significance beyond monetary value, raising questions about the motive behind their targeted removal (New York - Smithson Art Museum). The heist has prompted an increased sense of unease amongst New Yorkers who previously saw art security at these venues as impenetrable.

In a statement to supporters and fans during Thursday's charity event, Elizabeth Grant says her work was never meant for private ownership or the black market (New York - Home via email). "I created my works with love & passion; it breaks my heart that they were taken from me."

While local law enforcement continues to search high and low for any leads on this brazen crime, Grant has pledged her unwavering support towards the investigation. She shared in an interview last night: "I trust our police force will find those responsible because my art is not just about aesthetics; it's also deeply personal."

The heist may be linked to international criminal networks according to FBI agents who have been investigating similar crimes globally. Federal prosecutors say they are working closely with the New York authorities in hopes of catching all parties involved, and seizing any artwork found on illegal markets (Washington D.C - FBI Headquarters).

Aside from recovering stolen property, officials stress that their top concern remains public safety following this criminal act within close proximity to major population centers like New York City. "We have increased patrols throughout the city as a precaution," says Deputy Commissioner of Public Safety Anne Williams in an interview with ABC News yesterday (New York - NYPD headquarters).

The FBI has offered its full resources and expertise to assist local authorities, including deploying profilers who specialize in art heists. Meanwhile, the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs is working closely with museums throughout Manhattan ensuring that they follow best security practices moving forward (Manhattan - NYCDOCA).

Grant has urged her supporters to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity in their neighborhood or around cultural venues. "Let us show unity as New Yorkers, stand together for the sake of our city," says Grant while expressing gratitude
