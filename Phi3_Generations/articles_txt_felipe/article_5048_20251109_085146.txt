A recent survey conducted by Smithson Research Group indicates that hotel occupancy rates nationwide have surged beyond pre-pandemic levels as travel demand recovers in earnest during the summer season of this year. According to their findings, which took into account a wide array of hotels from budget options to luxury resorts across major cities like New York, Los Angeles, and Miami, occupancy rates have reached an unprecedented 85% as people increasingly feel comfortable traveling again post-vaccination.

Travel experts predict that the trend will continue through the upcoming holiday season. "This year' end marks a significant comeback for our industry," says Jane Doe, CEO of National Hotel Association (NHA). She attributes this resurgence to people feeling more secure and eager to explore after months spent mostly at home.

The report also found that hotels are experiencing higher occupancy rates in mid-week compared to weekends since business travelers have been returning first, followed by leisure guests over the past few weeks of summer. The influx is so significant that some areas were struggling with accommodating demand and resorting back to implementing advance booking requirements for certain hotels as a management strategy during peak times like Memorial Day or Independence Day weekends when occupancy can reach 95%.

A hotel manager from Beverly Hills, Emily Turner expressed her gratitude: "We are overjoyed at the return of our loyal customers and we appreciate their support in rebuilding consumer confidence." While hotels have seen successes during this period thanks to strong demand, they still face challenges regarding staffing shortages. The survey found that upwards 60% of hoteliers across all sectors are hiring extra personnel due to the sudden spike after being largely idle for a year and half since restrictions were first introduced in early 2020.

The increasing occupancy rates have had positive economic impacts on hotels, which saw revenues surpass expectations by nearly $3 billion compared to last summer season; however there are concerns about the inflated prices of commodities such as gas and food supplies leading to increased costs for both hoteliers and consumers. In anticipation of this trend continuing into 2022, several hotels have implemented policies requiring advance bookings months in advance when rooms become available due to high demand throughout summer and holiday seasons.

"I've never seen our industry so bustling," says John Smith, general manager at City Center Hotel located downtown Los Angeles with an occupancy rate of over 90%. "We are delighted but remain vigilant about managing costs for guests while also maintaining competitive pricing to ensure we continue drawing in customers."

The rise has sparked conversations among industry experts and consumers regarding the long-term impacts on travel habits, as well as how hotels can best adapt. "While it is promising that more people are willing to consider international trips for leisure or business now than before COVID hit," says Robert Jones of Travel Research Institute, a consultant with years in hospitality research and strategy development, he cautions not taking anything as guaranteed: “The future remains uncertain. Our industry must continue finding ways to be resilient amidst the ongoing unpredictability.”

As hoteliers navigate these complex issues impacting their businesses’ survival, many are continuously looking for innovative solutions such as partner-led promotions or loyalty program
