DURHAM, NORTH CAROLINA — In a remarkable discovery by researchers at Duke University'in Durham on Wednesday afternoon, April 14th, scientists unveiled the world’s smallest known heartbeat: an organism that beats not just once or twice per minute like most humans but hundreds of times in mere minutes. Named "MicroHeart," this microscopic marvel weighing less than a gram and measuring roughly 1/30th the size of a human cell has captured global attention, offering new insights into cardiac evolutionary biology while raising questions about potential medical applications that could revolutionize treatments for heart disease.

The lead researcher Dr. Emily Thompson explained in an interview with The New York Times on Friday morning: "Our findings showcase a tiny organism which, though it seems almost too fantastical to be true, exists right under our noses – quite literally." To create this minuscule marvel of nature's design that could offer new understandings about heart conditions and treatments down the line - scientists engineered a synthetic genome based on bacteria but with several key differences. Their creation was named MicroHeart, after its rapid beating capability reminiscent of normal human hearts despite being far smaller in size compared to conventional organisms that produce heartbeats for locomotion or respiration purposes like insects and worms do not rely on this mechanism exclusively as an internal transport system but also a protective one against environmental threats such as predators and pathogens.

Dr. Thompson's colleague, Prof. John Parkinson added during the same interview: "This is just incredible - something like half its size yet still functioning independently without any external support systems." The micro-engineered organism developed at Duke University has a biological heart that beats hundreds of times per minute as researchers study how different environmental factors affect this newfound ability and what it means for understanding life on Earth from millions to billions years ago.

Scientists first noticed the tiny beat back in March when they observed an odd movement under their electron microscope during routine genetic engineering experiments aimed at creating a better way of producing biofuels without relying on traditional crops like corn or soybeans that contribute massively to carbon dioxide emissions, according to Duke University press release.

The organism has been dubbed the world's smallest heartbeat by Dr. Thompson and her team in their paper published last weekend after months of painstaking observations involving 3D imaging techniques used for studying biological phenomena at near-atomic resolution levels where structures could be resolved down to individual atoms themselves under high-powered electron microscopes - allowing scientists not only visualize its minuscule heartbeat but also explore how these organisms develop and function over time.

Experts are hopeful that this discovery will lead them closer in understanding cardiac evolutionary biology better while offering potential ways to design novel therapies for those suffering from congenital or acquired defects affecting their hearts since Nature News noted: "Such an organism could hold the key toward creating tiny machines resembling artificial muscles powered by chemical energy."

As researchers continue working on this microscopic heartbeat, hopes are high that these findings will help us unlock new knowledge about evolution's secrets and how life has adapted over millennia. One thing remains clear
