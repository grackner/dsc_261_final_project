Suffering from a lack of variety and flavors in their local cuisine has prompted residents across Melbourne to explore beyond Australia's borders for culinary adventures during the holiday season this year. Across New South Wales, Sydneysiders are making plans as early as October when food enthusiasts began seeking unique dining experiences that promise an escape from everyday fare and deliver a taste of international cultures right at home in Australia's largest city.


According to the Melbourne Food Tourism Association (MFTA), there has been a significant uptick, by 30%, in bookings for multicultural food outings throughout October compared to last year’s figures during similar times of pre-holiday festivities. Organizers are attributing this surge partly to the rising interest among locals who wish to break their routine and explore flavors from around the globe without traveling far beyond city limits, as witnessed by Maria Gonzalezan, a regular attendee for MFTA-sponsored events.


"I wanted my family this year to experience something different but also feel connected," said Gonzalzana, who had been frequent diner in her local Spanish tapas restaurant and felt eager for new culinary frontiers since the pandemic curbed international travels back last March 2021. "And after trying some Thai food recently with a friend visiting from Bangkok, we're now hooked on exploring more Southeast Asian flavors."


The city has seen an influx of multicultural eateries and pop-up events throughout the quarter in locations like Fitzroy, Collingwood, and Docklands—all neighborhoods known for their vibrant mix of artsy crowds and foodie culture. Many owners reported that business had been booming as well; 60% have seen a rise or doubling over last year's numbers during this period alone according to the Federation of Restaurateurs & Caterers (FR&C), which represents thousands of restaurants nationwide across Australia and New Zealand.

"It’s incredibly gratifying seeing locals open up their palates," commented Chef An Nguyen, owner of a Vietnamese eatery in Docklands that had previously catered to expatriates from the old country but has seen its clientele shift significantly this year after being awarded as Best Newcomer by MFTA last December. "Everyone's been excited about trying new dishes and sharing stories behind their cuisine, which keeps me busy all day long."

The city government is also taking note of the trend with Mayor Angelo Salvatore pledging to support food tourism efforts that “foster diversity in flavors while strengthening local communities.” He pointed out last week during a press conference: "Melbourne's global culinary scene offers something for everyone, and it’s vital we celebrate our rich tapestry of cultures by introducing diverse cuisines to locals who may not have experienced them before."

The popularity of food-related tourism in Melbourne is a reflection on the desire among Australians—who are historically known for their love of barbecues, seafood meals, and steak dinners during holiday seasons like Christmas Day and New Year's Eve. Experts believe this shift to international cuisine may be part of an increasing globalization effect brought about by the digital age in which people have become
