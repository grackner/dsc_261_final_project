In a remarkable turn of events in Sudan's capital city Khartoum, an extensive archaeological expedition led by French researchers has uncovered what appears to be the legendary lost city of ancient Africa - Ivory Coast, believed to have been submerged underwater due to volcanic activity millions of years ago. The team announced their find on Tuesday at a press conference in Paris following months of diving and excavation work along Sudan's historical Nile River banks near the town of Al-Fashn, which lies about 60 miles southwest of Khartoum.

According to Dr. Marguerite Leroy, lead archaeologist with France’nerale Archéologie et Histoire (FAH), "We were searching for traces of lost African civilizations when we found Ivory Coast submerged in an underwater lake formed by a long-gone river branching off the Nile. The discovery is not only significant to Africa's history, but also sheds new light on prehistoric life and early human migration patterns."

The divers descended into Al-Fashn’s waters about six months ago as part of an initiative funded by France'NERALE Archaeological Foundation. After multiple dives over a span of two weeks, the team unearthed structures resembling man-made settlements and burial grounds believed to date back between 10,000 - 7 million years ago when early hominids roamed Africa's ancient savannah.

"This discovery shakes up our understanding of human history in ways we couldn’t even imagine," said Dr. Jean-Pierre Laurent from the French National Museum for History and Culture based out of Marseille, who will be heading a team studying these remains next year to piece together more details about their origins and purpose.

The discovery has sparked excitement among historians worldwide as it provides concrete evidence that Africa's rich history extends far beyond recorded times; this find alone challenges our perception of human civilizations evolving solely within Eurasian borders during ancient eras – a narrative often propagated by Eurocentric academia.

"Ivory Coast offers us invaluable insight into the lives and societies that thrived here long before written history," said Dr. Fatou Ba, an expert on West African civilizations from Senegal's Cheikh Anta Diop University in Dakar. "It is high time Africa receives due credit for its contributions to human evolution."

Furthermore, experts caution that preserving these underwater relics will require careful planning and substantial resources – an endeavor likely beyond local capabilities alone as Sudan has recently faced political instability amidst economic hardship. "Ivory Coast requires delicate handling during excavation," said Dr. Laurent, a French historian specializing in African studies based at Paris' École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales (EHESS).
"We are currently discussing potential partnerships with the Sudanese government and other international institutions to ensure its preservation." A spokesperson for President Omar al-Bashir commented on Tuesday that "Sudan is open, willing, ready – let's celebrate this monumental discovery together as a country proud of our diverse heritage!"

Reactions across social media platforms echoed the sentiment shared by Sudanese officials: from heartfelt pride in one’
