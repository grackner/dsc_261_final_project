In a historic move yesterday in London, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that Brexit negotiations would resume this Thursday with renewed vigor as talks continue to finalize the terms of departure from the European Union (EU). This latest development follows months of stalled discussions over trade arrangements and citizens' rights.

At Prime Minister’ extradural office, Boris Johnson stated that "we are committed to finding a fair deal for Britain while ensuring our national interests remain paramount." The UK government has been eager to conclude the Brexit process since 2016 when then-Prime Minister Theresa May initiated talks with EU leaders. However, her efforts failed to result in an agreement acceptable to both sides as well as within Britain itself.

Experts believe that while Johnson's announcement represents progress towards the long-awaited Brexit deal, many details still need clarification before any substantive negotiations can begin. Notably absent from today’s discussion was talks about tariffs and customs - major contentious issues in previous meetings between UK officials and their EU counterparts over the past three years of ongoing discussions which have repeatedly collapsed due to disagreements, mostly relating to these aspects along with fishing rights.

"The issue here isn't just about what happens when we leave Europe but also how it will impact our daily lives," said Professor Emily Smithson from London School of Economics who specializes in European Studies and has been observing Brexit negotiations for years now - "We need a deal that balances the economic needs while respecting national sovereignty."

Members across political parties welcomed Johnson's announcement with cautious optimism but insist on transparency in all upcoming negotiations. Business groups, especially those heavily reliant upon EU trade like fishermen and importers of goods from the continent fear economic downturn if no agreement is reached soon enough - "A smooth transition will mitigate disruption for businesses," commented Tom Evansa leading representative of Seafood Exporters UK.

Negotiators representing both sides plan to address these critical issues as negotiations resume this coming Thursday, with the hopes that a breakthrough deal can be reached before March deadline set by EU leaders; otherwise, Britain would have no choice but accept terms dictated through "a backstop agreement." 

While it's too early to tell how citizens will feel once full details of such negotiations emerge, many remain anxious over potential economic hardship. This time-sensitive issue continues to hang heavily on everyone - especially those who have lived and worked within EU borders for years or even generations seeking clarity regarding their future status after Brexit comes into effect in January 2021; a date marking the end of what many refer now as "The Trial."
