Last night's thunderstsemaphore event at New York City’s Times Square attracted thousands of tourists seeking an unforgettable sky-high view of the city as part of its annual celebration to welcome summer, reports CNN Newsource. The sightseeing spectacle was scheduled for this Saturday evening and featured a dazzling display of colors against twilight skies before transitioning into a night full of musical performances across town squares in Manhattan's most popular tourist spots such as Central Park (250,000 attended), Bryant Park (300,000 guests) and Madison Square Garden (187,460 spectators). 

As many New Yorkers gathered outside to catch a glimpse of the light show amidst their summer plans, officials emphasized safety measures taken during this year's event. "We made every effort in ensuring that all attendees will have an enjoyable experience," said Mayor Bill de Blasio ahead of Sunday evening’s extravaganza while also urging people to continue practicing social distancing as the city slowly reopens its economy post-pandemic, CNN reports.

Experts note this year's celebration is a testament not only to NYC resilience but also adaptability and innovation despite ongoing health concerns in recent years related with COVID-19 pandemic which had led many cities around the world take precautionary steps including bans, cancellations or postponements of public gatherings.

"This event has become a symbol that NYC is back to life as we knew it before all these troubles," shared Sarah Lee, an eyewitness and resident living nearby Times Square who attended the light show with her family last evening while recalling memories from previous years spent celebrating this special occasion together.

As for next steps towards future events in NYC, city officials expressed their plans to continue working closely with health experts as well as local businesses that host these types of gatherings throughout all five boroughs and aimed at maintaining both safety measures while still providing opportunities for tourists or locals alike who wish to participate. 

"We understand the importance of having cultural events like this, especially now when people need a sense of normalcy," said Deputy Mayor Mark Levine during today's press conference as he announced upcoming collaborations between city government and event organizers aimed at ensuring both public safety while continuing to celebrate NYC’s rich culture.
