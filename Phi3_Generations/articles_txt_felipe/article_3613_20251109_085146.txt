Topic: World - Europe

Europe faces a record heatwave as temperatures soar across countries stretching from Spain to Russia. In cities like Madrid and Paris, thermometers have consistently been above 40 degrees Celsius since early July. The World Health Organization has issued warnings about the potential health risks for vulnerable populations in several European nations already grappling with water shortages caused by a persistent drought that's persisted over months and spread to more than half of Europe as per data from April 2018 released this week. Experts predict temperatures will continue rising through the summer, likely exceeding records set just last year in both Spain (June) and France (August).

"We are witnessing climate change firsthand," stated Dr. Maria Gomez, a climatologist at Madrid University who has been tracking weather patterns across Europe since 2015. "The impacts on human health cannot be overstated." Temperatures in the Alps have risen an average of three degrees Celsius over the last five decades according to UN data from January, contributing significantly towards declining glaciers and snow cover which are critical sources for European freshwater.

As temperatures rise relentlessly across Europe, governments scramble in response – with several already deploying emergency measures like opening public swimming pools as cooling centres during the heat of the day since late July when Spain officially declared its most severe drought on record back in 2018.

However, experts warn these are short-term solutions and long term strategies must be considered to counteract climate change which is largely caused by greenhouse gas emissions that continue unabated worldwide as per a report released last November claiming CO2 levels hit an all-time high in 2019.

Dr. Thomas Weiss, Director of the European Climate Change Centre based at Berlin University commented on how countries have been taking action since climate change was formally recognized decades ago: "We've seen numerous strategies to mitigate its impacts but without concrete actions such as reducing our carbon footprint and investing in renewable energy sources, we risk worsening the situation."
