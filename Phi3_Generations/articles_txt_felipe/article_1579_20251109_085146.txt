In a historic move on Thursday in Brussels, European Union leaders have agreed to establish an independent investigative body aimed at rooting out corruption within its institutions over the next decade. The deal was reached during closed-door negotiations amongst EU heads of state and government representatives last night.

"Corruption is a cancer that eats away our democratic values," said Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, one of several leaders present in Brussels for yesterday' end to the 15th European Council meeting since June. "We must be united against it."

The body will operate under Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union and aim to increase transparency within EU institutions while preventing fraudulent activities that could harm member states financially or politically at a time when countries across Europe are struggling with post-pandemic economic recovery. The independent entity is expected to start operating in early 2024, according to reports from the meeting obtained by Sky News and Bellingcat, an investigative journalism organization based near Brussels.

"The creation of this body will bring us one step closer to restoring trust among EU citizens," said Austrian Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg after hearing about plans for Thursday's agreement during yesterday afternoon's press conference in Vienna, Austria - where the European Council meets every six months. "It is essential that we address this issue head-on."

As of now it remains unclear what resources or powers will be granted to investigators by EU leaders beyond Article 7 provisions currently being applied against Hungary and Poland for breaking national laws with consequences on freedom, democracy, rule of law within their respective countries. However officials say the scope would expand significantly from current measures imposed through sanctions that have not deterred misconducts in these nations to date.

"The creation of this body will bring us one step closer to restoring trust among EU citizens." – Austrian Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg, as quoted by Sky News and Bellingcat reporters last night at the European Council meeting yesterday afternoon in Brussels' Elysee Palace ahead of a final vote.

CNN has reached out for comment from several national leaders present during negotiations but have not yet received any response regarding this development or details on how it may impact EU-U.S., UK, and Turkey relations going forward when sanction measures are enforced against Hungary and Poland under Article 7 of the Treaty.

A senior German official told Deutsche Welle in Brussels today that although creating an investigative body is a significant step towards addressing corruption within EU institutions, it's not yet clear if this development will have any immediate effect on current sanctions or consequences imposed against Hungary and Poland for violating national laws with implications regarding freedom, democracy, rule of law.

"The establishment of an independent investigative body is a positive move," the official said yesterday in Berlin after meeting German Chancellor Olaf Scholz amidst recent reports about potential consequences imposed against Hungary and Poland for their actions leading to Article 7 proceedings starting this year, "but we must still wait on details regarding scope."

A spokespsse from the Czech government today also expressed concern over creating an independent investigative body's impact amidst existing sanctions being enforced in both countries. The official stated that any new measures taken should align with Article 2 of Treaty, which protects national sovereignty
