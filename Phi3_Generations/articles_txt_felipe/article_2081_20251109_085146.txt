As of Thursday morning in Chicago, Illinois, reports have surfaced detailing a significant rise in petty crime rates throughout March and April amidst widespstatic COVID-19 pandemic fears that saw many residents stay indoors for extended periods. According to local law enforcement data released today by the Chicago Police Department (CPD), there has been an uptick of 20% in burglaries, a rise of nearly 35% in vehicle break-ins and approximately doubled incidents of retail fraud within these months alone.

Chief Inspector Raymond O'Connor shared his concern: "We are seeing more people resorting to crime due to desperation caused by the lockdown measures." He also urged residents not to let fear dictate their behavior, advising them instead on preventative safety strategies when they must go out for essential errands.

Ex-convict and reformed citizen Tonya Robinson was among those affected during this time frame: "I needed money more than ever as I lost my job because of the pandemic," she said while sitting in her now empty apartment, forced to vacate after several unsuccessful burglary attempts.

The National Association for Criminal Defense emphasized that lockdown doesn't exempt individuals from their legal responsibilities and encouraged everyone not just business owners but all members of the community - including residents – to ensure they have proper security measures in place, especially when leaving essential items outside as potential loot.

A local professor studying crime trends at DePaul University mentioned that this pattern is consistent with similar cases worldwide during past pandemics and economic crises: "History has shown us patterns of increased thefts due to socio-economic uncertainties." He further added, suggesting preventive measures can mitigate these situations.

Looking forward to next steps or reactions? CPD plans a series of public workshops in collaboration with community leaders and local businesses aimed at creating tailored safety strategies for different areas within Chicago this coming month. In the words of O'Connor, "Proactivity is our best defense right now."
