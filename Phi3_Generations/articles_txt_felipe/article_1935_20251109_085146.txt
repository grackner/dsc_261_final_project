Pro Bowl MVP Candidate Injured in Practice Fall: 'I'm on a roller coaster ride I never wanted to get on.'

Washington D.C., USA - Aaron Rodgers, the star quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers who is leading his team through an undefeated season and making him one of the top contenders for this year's Pro Bowl MVP award has sustained a serious injury during yesterday evening’th practice session.

In what was supposed to be another routine drill, Rodgers took a nasty fall while going head-to-head with linebacker Chris Gardner resulting in an apparent knee sprain which requires immediate medical attention and could keep him sidelined for weeks if not months depending on the severity of his injury.

"He's always been one to take hits like this but I never thought he would get hurt so badly," said head coach, Bill Belichick who had a personal rapport with Rodgers during their brief stint together in Green Bay before coming over here two seasons ago. "I just hope the doctor clears him soon."

Rodger's absence leaves his backup Kevin Hogan as an obvious but yet unlikely replacement given that he has been thrust into this position only because of injuries sustained by both starting QB Colt McCoy and back-up Aaron Lewis. However, some NFL experts believe Hogan could still turn out to be the dark horse pick for Pro Bowl MVP if Rodgers is forced to miss a significant amount of time.

"Kevin has shown he can step up when needed," said veteran quarterbacks coach Steve Ortmayer who worked with both players throughout their careers but never had them playing against each other like this before in person or on tape. "This situation is unfortunate for Aaron, and I hope everyone supports him as best they can during his recovery."

Rodgers remains non-committal about how long it will take to return while emphasizing that he has faith the injury isn't serious enough to cause permanent damage like what happened last season when Rodger suffered a debilitating knee cap tear against Baltimore at home in early November. That particular incident sidelined him for almost two months until his recent surgery and comeback late December which was too little, too late as the 49ers lost their first six games while he missed that much time before finishing strong to earn a Wild Card win over Seattle during Rodgers' absence when they went on to lose in round one of last year’s playoffs.

"I know I am going through some tough times right now but my family and friends have been very supportive," said the former Green Bay Packer who has always thrived under pressure throughout his successful 16-year career with an average passer rating that currently stands at a near historic high mark of over 95, according to Pro Football Reference. "I appreciate all the well wishes coming my way and I am confident in my abilities even if this means some tough times ahead."

The team's front office remains optimistic about Rodgers returning before season's end but is realistically planning for contingencies should he not be able to do so. Back-up Kevin Hogan, meanwhile continues practicing in hopes that his arm and touch will get better with each day as the clock ticks down toward next weekend’s regular season finale against Dallas at home where victory could lead them into round two
