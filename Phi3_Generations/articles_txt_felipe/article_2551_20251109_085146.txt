In an architectural revelation at New York's Central Park on September 5th, a group of enthusiasts stumbled upon what they believe to be remnants of the park’s original design plans from as early as 1862 by Calvert V. Lyon and Frederick Law Olmsted – dubbed 'Lost Architectural Wonders'. The finders reportedly saw an old, weathered parchment buried in a secluded area near Bethesda Fountain where once the park’s famous statue stands guard over Lake Drive visitors today.

During initial examinations by experts from Columbia University's Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation on September 6th, indications are that these plans were never officially put into effect or publicly shared due to their unconventional designs which deviated significantly from Olmsted’s well-established vision for the park.

"The discovery is quite extraordinary," said Dr. Sarah Johnson, a professor at Columbia's School of Architecture and lead investigator on this peculiar find. "We believe these plans reflect an alternate direction that perhaps could have led Central Park down an unrecognized path if it had been executed." The drawings include intricate details showcasing elevated walkways encircling the lake, creating a natural amphitheater within which visitors would be secluded from city noise and able to enjoy intimate performances.

"I never knew this part of Central Park held such secrets," expressed one passerby who had heard about the discovery on September 7th by word-of-mouth in Manhattan's Upper West Side neighborhood, where local business owners have voiced interest in capitalizing commercially from the area. "It’s like finding hidden history right under our feet."

However, officials caution against any premature exploitation of these plans without proper evaluation and understanding their historical significance - a sentiment echoed by Central Park's superintendent Michael Tierney who expressed concerns about disrupting ongoing natural processes within the park for human consumption. "While we respect everyone’s right to explore, preserving our history is as crucial," he stated during an interview with 'The DailyMail'.

"There are many unexplored aspects of historical architecture in New York City and Central Park that remain a mystery until studied further,” said Dr. John Harris from the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Architecture Department on September 8th, who also visited to examine these plans alongside their team members at Columbia University when not preoccupied with curating exhibits for upcoming months which include several notable examples featuring Frank Lloyd Wright’s Fallingwater house and I.M Pei’s modernist Guggenheim museum in New York City itself amongst others.

Next steps are being determined as a joint committee consisting of park preservationists, architectural historians from Columbia University's School of Architecture along with city officials work together to plan the next phase – carefully excavation while leaving untouched parts intact; ensuring no harm comes unto New York’s historical treasure trove that has now come into public consciousness.

The Central Park Conservancy remains vigilant in their commitment towards maintaining a delicate balance between embracing and preserving history whilst allowing the city to grow around them – as reflected by Elizabeth Roché, Director of Communications for The New York City Department of Environmental Protection when reflecting on this recent revelation: “Central Park is not just an oasis in urban j
