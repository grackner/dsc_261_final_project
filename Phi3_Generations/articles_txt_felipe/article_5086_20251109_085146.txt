Lagos — In an unprecedented move to address the escalating crisis, President Muhammadu Buhari announced on Monday that military action would be intensified across five towns and villages within a designated region of the state. The separatist group known as 'The Eastern Advocates' has been fighting for self-determination since 2015 when tensions flared following an election dispute, which led to mass protests against perceived governmental marginalization in Agbor State located near Nigeria’s oil hub.

"Our security forces are ready and determined," said spokesman for the military's operation Colonel Amos Adebajo on Monday as troops began patrolling strategic areas targeted by insurgents along a 30-mile frontline that has been largely uncontested until now, reports CNN Africa.

The President emphasized his commitment to finding peaceful resolution through dialogue and stressed the importance of rebuilding trust with all communities in this region: "We cannot allow these divisions among our people to continue growing." The spokesman added that intelligence gathering operations would also be stepped up, although details have not yet been disclosed.

Despite this tragedy that affected many small businesses within these communities and prompted thousands to seek refuge in neighboring towns such as Apoolu-Olunagbani, there remains hope among locals.

"I am confident the government will bring stability back," said Pastor Michael Ibe who has been leading efforts by churches alongside security forces since last summer's violence broke out while attending peace talks between insurgents and representatives from other sectors of Agbor State society in Ondo City. “The situation here is dire, but we have seen progress already."

Although sporadic clashes continue between armed groups and security forces around major towns such as Agbor, Ogbele, Okunrin-Owo/Onisa where insurgents maintain a strong presence on the outskirts with fortified positions behind dense foliage; several civilians remain displaced while fleeing these tensions.

According to official figures from Ondo State Government's Office of Social Services, as many as 50,000 people have been internally displaced in recent months due largely attributable factors such as unrest and natural disaster caused by heavy rains at the end of
