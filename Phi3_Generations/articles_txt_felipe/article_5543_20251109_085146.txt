In a groundbresel breakthrough in gene therapy research today at Johns Hopkins University, scientists announced success in treating inherited blindness with stem cells derived from bone marrow of patients themselves - the first time this personalized approach has been demonstrated to restore vision. The experimental treatment was successfully administered on 10 participants who had a rare genetic form of childhood blindness caused by mutations in their RPE65 gene, taking place between January and March of this year at Baltimore's Advanced Hematology Center within the university's medical facility.

"These are extraordinary times for medicine," says Dr. Emily Chen, lead researcher on the project who is excited about these promising results but cautions that years more clinical trials will be needed before this could become a widely available treatment option. "What we have learned from our team's work here today may well revolutionize how medical treatments are tailored for genetic conditions."

Born with the condition, each of these children had suffered vision loss by age 4 or five due to their body’s inability to process light properly because cells meant to absorb it have died off. It led to a buildup of pigmented waste material called drusen at nerve endings between retinal tissue and the choroid, causing significant vision loss by age seven or eight that ultimately resulted in total blindness as these children grew up into adults - an unfortunate outcome for those with this genetic disorder.

For years researchers have tried injecting healthy stem cells directly inside retinas to replace dead eye cell tissue but were unable, before today's breakthrough, to use a patient’s own bone marrow-derived stem cells as the replacement because they don't naturally become certain types of light processing nerve endings needed for vision.

"We took this approach out of pure desperation," says Dr. Chen referring back three years ago when she saw no other treatment options, which included implanting retinal tissue from deceased organ donors that had not worked well enough to restore sight in all cases - and sometimes left patients still visually impaired or even blind despite the attempts at regenerative medicine treatments.

This time around, by genetically engineering these cells right outside the body of study subjects using CRISPR-Cas9 technology before injecting them back into their retinas after taking small amounts of bone marrow from each person’s hip or shoulder joint during a minimally invasive procedure performed under general anesthesia, researchers found that all 10 had significant improvements in vision as seen using ophthalmoscopy to examine the backs of eyes.

"The science is working wonders," says one participant's father who could see more distinctly and better during follow-up evaluations a few weeks later but remains cautiously optimistic about how his child’s vision will progress in years ahead since no treatment has been shown to restore sight permanently yet. "I just want my kid back, even if it takes time."

Although the trial was small and funded by private donors with some money coming from government grants for biomedical research at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine under Dr. Chen’s leadership since 2017 when she first began investigating gene therapy techniques using stem cells, experts say these findings could pave the way to more successful future trials involving larger patient populations if rep
