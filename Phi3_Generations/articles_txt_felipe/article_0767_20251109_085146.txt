Asia-Pacific region witnesses historic lunar eclipse tonight with millions in attendance across multiple countries to celebrate this rare celestial event which has not occurred since April of the previous year due to a miscalculation by astronomers, reports CNN Asia correspondent John Doe. The extraordinary alignment took place overnight between September 23 and 24, drawing attention from people in more than twenty nations with large populations across East Asia where local festivities were held at prominent observatories including Tokyo's renowned Skywatch Tower on the evening of Friday before the full moon to celebrate this once-in-a-lifetime occasion.

The lunar eclipse, which lasted for over four hours and was visible from various locations in Asia such as Singapore (where crowds numbering into thousands gathered at Marina Bay), Thailand's Chiang Mai province with its annual Lunar Eclipse Festival attracting around 10,000 participants worldwide. Across Europe too astronomers noted similar interest when the partial eclipse happened last night over Greece and Italy as spectators watched from historic sites such as Athens Olympic Stadium (where approximately 5,000 enthusiasts came out for midnight viewings) or San Marino's Cima alle Testa peak.

"It is indeed a magnificent sight," said astrophysicist Dr Jane Smith at Tokyo Skywatch Tower just before the eclipse began unfolding across Asia’s skies after sunset - witnessed live on national broadcaster NHK along with countless social media channels, which themselves have experienced exponential growth in lunar-eclipse viewership. While millions of people worldwide were fortunate to catch a glimpse or streaming online video provided by popular astronomical societies and government bodies offering expert commentary through live feeds from local observatories equipped with advanced telescopes such as the Japan Astronomical Agency (JAO).

The total lunar eclipse began at approximately 9:30 pm JST after several partial eclipses had already started earlier that day - signalling an important phase in nature's celestial dance where Earth positions itself directly between Sun and Moon every few months. Dr Jane Smith, who has studied these events since childhood with family members at her side watching such spectacles growing up; shared insight into how this alignment would bring the full moon to its brightest point during totality (the core of eclipse), when shadows cast by Earth's atmosphere will create an array of colors and patterns across the lunar surface - often appearing coppery red or orange hues depending on atmospheric conditions: "The last time such a spectacle occurred was in April 2019. However, due to miscalculations made earlier this year by astronomers leading up towards December's Full Moon; we had missed the opportunity as our skies would have been cloud-covered," Doe adds from Tokyo where large crowds at Skywatch Tower eagerly await for Dr Smith and her team of expert observers.

Aside from scientific interest, lunar eclipses also hold cultural significance in many Asian societies with various traditional rituals or festivals incorporating beliefs about celestial harmony into communal celebrations – often invoking blessings on harvests for farmers and wishing prosperity upon families living alongside natural world cycles: "Our Lunar Eclipse Festival here at Chiang Mai's historic city center brings together Buddhist monks chanting prayers in Pali language as they gather around
