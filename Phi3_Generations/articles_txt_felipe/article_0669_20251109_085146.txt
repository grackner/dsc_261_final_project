A culinary festival celebrating French cuisine drew to a close in New Orleans last weekend with an attendance exceeding expectations and praise from industry experts for showcasing innovative dishes that stay true to traditional flavors. Held over three days at the historic Jackson Square, more than 20 renowned chefs presented their creations highlighting classic French techniques enhanced by local Louisiana ingredients like okra, Andouille sausage and spices native to Creole cuisine. The event attracted a crowd of roughly 4,50 end-users who sampled over 120 dishes ranging from coq au vin with smoky Cajun pepperoncini to beignets infused with citrus zest and local spices.

Celebrated food critic Marie Lafite shared her experience, saying, "I was blown away by the creativity here; it felt like a celebration of French flavors melded perfectly with New Orleans' culinary spirit." Organizer Chef Pierre Bouchard added, “We wanted to honor our city’s rich history while paying homage to France. We hope we succeeded.”

Chef Bouchard further emphasized this mentoring aspect by saying, “We're fostering the next generation of culinary talent right here in our city.”

In addition to gastronomic pleasures for festival-goers’ taste buds and Instagrammable moments with signature dishes like bananas Foster Crepes de Beignet suivi by a crème brûlée was enjoyed. Visitors were also treated to wine tastings featuring French wines blended locally, as well as live jazz performances that set an enchanting ambiance throughout the event duration from Saturday morning through Sunday evening.
