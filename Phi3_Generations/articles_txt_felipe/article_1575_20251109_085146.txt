A remarkable culinary event unfolded in New York City last weekend when an impromptin gastronomic festival took over Times Square for three days and nights of non-stop foodie fun. Between the unconventional flavors, local seafood specials at renowned waterfront diners like Pier 41 Deli – which boasts a menu with as many tastes per dish as ingredients on their tables -and pop-up eateries specializing in artisanal cheeses and cured meats, the festival promised to be one of the most exotic culinary adventures NYC has seen.

"This event is a celebration for every palate you could imagine," said Chef Gordon Ramsay during his spontaneous appearance at "Feast with Flavor", an initiative organized by local food influencers and enthusiasts on May 8th, marking the start of this extraordinary weekend.

"The festival brings that into my own kitchen."

A highlight of this event was the three Michelin-starred restaurant Le Gourmet de Jean Coq’s pop-up stall offering its signature dish, the Pea & Cream Pâté à la Reine – a delicacy combining frozen peas and cream in a way that surprised as many attendees with their unconventional combination.

"The whole city knows about Le Gourmet de Jean Coq's famed dishes, so it was intriguing to see what else they can do," said John Baxter, 45-year old businessman from Manhattan who traveled down from his Upper East Side office. "I couldn’t believe the peas and cream worked together that way."
