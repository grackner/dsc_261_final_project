A major breakthrough in climate research has been made by scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory as they report unprecedented ice loss from Greenland and Antarctica over the past decade. The findings, based on satellite data, reveal a significant acceleration of melting rates compared to previous years.

Scientists have been closely monitoring glaciers in both regions for decades now but what has come as an eye-opener is how quickly this meltwater could potentially raise global sea levels by several meters over the next century if left unchecked, say experts from Columbia University's Earth System Science division.

"This study underscores just how urgent it becomes for us all to take action in order prevent runaway climate change," says Dr. Sarah Johnson, lead author of a new report on glacial meltwater impact published earlier this month and an associate professor at the university's School of Arts & Sciences based out of New York City, adding that "we are rapidly approaching tipping points which might push us into irreversible changes."

Scientists involved in these findings say although natural climate variability does contribute to glacial retreat — a phenomenon they have been tracking since the early 1980s via field expeditions or aerial surveys around both poles; overall, human-induced warming remains as key driver for current observed accelerations.

"The data clearly show that Greenland and Antarctica are melting at an alarming rate due to rising global temperatures," explains Prof John Miller from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver who has worked extensively on climate model studies throughout his career with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory located near Los Angeles. He cautions though that "there is still uncertainty around some factors like future precipitation patterns or cloud cover over these regions which can impact meltwater production rates."

According to the study led by Johnson and Miller, if current melting trends persist without intervention measures being implemented worldwide; this could result in sea levels rising upwards of 2.5 meters across major coastal cities including New York's Manhattan borough within just over a century timeframe causing widespread flooding disaster scenarios with millions more people displaced globally than previously thought feasible under current policies alone will be able to address effectively mitigate such risks as rapidly warming ocean temperatures continue fueling unprecedented rates of glacial melting from both poles simultaneously.

"Increased ice loss is not just an issue for polar regions; it's a global problem affecting everyone," states Michael Tan, UN Climate Change Policy Advisor speaking last Friday at COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh Egypt where delegates gathered annually since 1995 representing their governments around the world working towards implementing stronger policies protecting vulnerable coastal communities most likely impacted by rising sea levels due to meltwater influx into oceans. Tan notes that "the science has spoken loud and clear - we need immediate action if humanity is going avoid irreversible consequences stemming directly from unchecked greenhouse gas emissions."

Given the potentially catastrophic implications for coastal cities around globe, countries including Japan which faced land submersion issues earlier this month due to Typhoon Maysak in combination with record-high sea levels; have already begun mobilizing resources towards developing innovative solutions such as floating architecture concepts or even ambitious plans like building artificial barrier
