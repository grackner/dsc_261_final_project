A soccer ball rolled across a dusty field in tiny Tonga late last month when an unexpected downpour forced fans to seek cover and delayed what would have been one of the most eager-anticipated youth World Cup qualifiers since South Africa hosted its debut event back in 2010.

It rained on May 5th, a mere three days before Tonga'in national team was scheduled for an international soccer tour where they hoped to earn valuable experience against stronger teams from Asia and Oceania. The Pacific archipelago has never qualified past the group stage in any World Cup qualifying event after drawing with New Zealand during their last outing at a regional tournament in September 2021, so when the team landed back home on May 5th for training before heading to Fiji next weekend — only one of four matches they're playing this season — expectations were sky-high.

"We have been working incredibly hard as a national football development program," Tonga coach Lopeti Ginto said at the time in an interview with New Zealand Radio Network, which reported on its website that he hoped to "build confidence and belief within our squad." His ambition was clear: He saw Fiji's semi-pro side playing against his team as a potential step toward qualifying for next year’s AFC Asian Cup.

But clouds soon rolled in from the east, dumping nearly 2 inches of rain on what looked like Tonga might be heading into one bright future after all - with just over two weeks until their crucial final match against American Samoa at Nuku'alofa Stadium here locally that day. That would have been a historic first in soccer for the country, if they had managed to make it through on home soil as anticipated by many of Tongan fans who gathered eagerly just days before — and even more so when Fiji hosted their national team at ANZ National Football Stadium earlier this month which saw 30-year veteran Sam Brown return from injury with his hometown club Wellington Phoenix, where he scored six times last season for them.

In an interview on May 5th after training wrapped up under a tent set up in anticipation of the rain to protect equipment and players alike - as some fans did what they could by carrying umbrellas over — Ginto said his team would be ready no matter how bad things got, adding that "we have always been strong when it rains."

"We are a young squad with so much heart," he continued. “But sometimes we need more experience and exposure to international standards which I think playing against Fiji will give us the confidence.” However despite his team's desire for extra motivation, there was little they could do now as "the Tongan weather gods" were not on their side that day when just before kickoff a heavy shower came pouring down and continued intermittently through halftime.

Television cameras panned back to the stadium seating during rain delays while some players huddled together inside, visibly uncomfortable as they waited out their turn with waterlogged shorts soaked into nothingness before stepping outside again for yet another brief pause in play. "This is something we have no control over but let's not forget it happens on the biggest stages too," Tonga assistant coach Falei Pouha said later via radio repors who were covering him from his hotel room at the time, which
