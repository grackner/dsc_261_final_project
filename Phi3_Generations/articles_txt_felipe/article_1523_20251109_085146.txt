A massive cyclone battered South Asia overnight as it struck with devastating force in Bangladesh and India's eastern states before moving north into Myanmar on Monday morning local time (18:00 GMT Sunday). Heavy rainfall exceeding two feet has been reported across the region, triggering widespde flooding. At least 35 fatalities have occurred so far due to storm surges and collapsing structures in densely populated areas along low-lying river plains and deltas where millions reside without adequate warning systems or infrastructure protection against such natural disasters, the South Asia Disaster Centre reported.

As of this writing on Tuesday morning local time (06:00 GMT), weather patterns indicate that Tropical Cyclone 'Odisha' may be losing intensity but still poses a significant threat to life and property in vulnerable coastal areas before heading westward across the Bay of Bengal. The storm, forming off the east African coast on Saturday night local time (07:00 GMT), brought sustained winds exceeding 120 mph with destructive waves reaching as high as ten feet at peak intensity and causing widespread damage in India's eastern provinces before turning north towards Bangladesh. The Bay of Bengal, which acts like a natural funnel for cyclones approaching from the Indian Ocean toward mainland Asia during certain times of year between May to November, is now experiencing unprecedented storm activity this season as global temperatures continue to rise and weather patterns become increasingly erratic.

"These events have been predicted since we started our early warning systems a decade ago," says Dr. Rajesh Roy, Director General of India's Meteorological Department (IMD). "But the sheer magnitude is something unseen before in this region." Emergency services across multiple countries are struggling to respond amidst ongoing flooding that has already displaced hundreds of thousands and left entire villages submerged under water.

"We have deployed all available resources, but it feels like battling a tidal wave," says Sunita Kumari, Chief Secretary for Disaster Management in Odisha state which saw the greatest impact from Cyclone 'Odisha' within Indian borders thus far as millions of coastline residents prepare evacuations to safety shelters.

As governments scramble to assist affected populations and restore essential services like electricity, clean water supply systems are being prioritized along with temporary shelter arrangements for thousands forced out from their homes due to destruction or flooding caused by the cyclone's torrential rains that could last several days.

Experts warn about continuing disrufort in weather conditions and stress on infrastructure as nations continue efforts aimed at recovery, rebuilding of damaged areas while working with international humanitarian organizations to assist displaced persons across multiple countries' shared watershed zones affected by Cyclone 'Odisha.'

"The situation demands an urgent global response," says Ameen Rashid Khan, Secretary General for Oxfam International. "We are seeing millions without access to food or shelter amidst rising sea levels and extreme weather events due in part to climate change impacting communities already struggling with poverty."

Society's increasing vulnerability towards natural disasters calls upon governments across nations sharing this geographical zone along the Bay of Bengal coastline, including Bangladesh, India, Sri L
