Hartford Winter Haven Rinks Report: Exciting Weekend Game Turned Chaotic Amidst Snowfall

By Associated Press
March 3, 2024 - Hartford and surrounding areas experienced heavy snowfalls this weekend which led to the suspension of regular hockey games. The New England Hockey League had arranged a thrilling semi-final matchup between local teams from Westfield Junior High (916) Ice Rink and East Haven Senior School, scheduled for Saturday evening at 7:00 PM EST on Hartford's Riverfront Arena Stage.

However, as the game was about to begin under a cloudy sky with only an inch of snow predicted by meteorologists from Worcester Weather Service (WWS), things took an unexpected turn when sudden blizzard conditions struck at 6:45 PM just before tip-off. By then, approximately two inches had accumulated on the ice surface and visibility was reduced to less than a mile due to whiteout conditions caused by rapid snowfall rates of up to five inches per hour—more than double what WWS originally forecasted for peak weather intensity in this part of Connecticut (CNN).

Westfield Coach, Peter Thompson remarked during an interview on Friday night before the event that he and his team were ready despite some concerns about potential delays. "We've been practicing under all possible scenarios," said a determined-looking coach as players shuffled out onto frozen ponds dressed in full gear with bright orange visors to shield their eyes from icy winds buffeting Hartford streets this weekend while heading towards the arena for what was expected to be an intense showdown.

Unfortunately, even pre-tournament optimism couldn't protect fans or players as they fought through treacherous conditions only months before when similar events were held at Riverfront Arena Stage during Hartford’s infamous Blizzard of '14—a memory that quickly resurfaced today.

As the storm intensified, officials from both teams and arena staff evacuated spectators using shuttle buses provided by local transport company Capital Transit Services Ltd., which had been dispatched along with emergency crews prior to game time due to escalating weather concerns voiced on Thursday evening.

"We knew we couldn't allow any risks," said Hartford Fire Department Captain Mark Johnson who helped coordinate safe exits for thousands of fans amidst the blizzard conditions that quickly worsened following an initial dusting snowfall earlier this weekend (Daily Mail). "Our top priority was everyone’s safety."

The suspension came shortly after 6:58 PM when arena staff announced via intercom announcements and social media platforms, including the official Hartford Hockey League Twitter account @HLTourney2024 on which hundreds of fans commented their disappointment at game cancellation. This abrupt decision followed a period during which games had been postponed multiple times due to weather conditions affecting several nearby venues in Massachusetts and Rhode Island as well (AP).

East Haven Senior School’s Head Coach, Laura Peterson said her team was disappointed but understood the situation. “As dedicated athletes ourselves,” she told supporters during a post-game press conference on Sunday afternoon after returning home safely from their overnight stay at local hotel The Hartford Inn & Suites near Windsor Locks (USA Today).
