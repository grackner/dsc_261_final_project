As monsoon season descends upon South Asia once again this year, India is bracing for severe weather that has historically led to flooding in multiple states across northern regions of the country each summer. Meteorologists warn heavy rains and possible cloudbursts could lead to significant river swelling by mid-August when most parts are expected to start experienner waterlogging issues, putting local communities at risk for potential loss of life as well as property damage due to flooding in some areas that have not recovered from previous disaster.

According to a report released earlier this week on the meteorological forecast by India's Meteorological Department (IMD), rainfall levels expected could be up 35% above what is typical for August, based off of their seven-day prediction stretching out through at least mid-August. This weather will likely affect states like Uttarakhand in the Himalayan range and Bihar to Punjab on lower plains where river basin systems already struggle with poor infrastructure that is unable to handle excess water, particularly when they reach capacity during flooding season which runs from July through September.

"We're closely monitoring how much rainfall these forecasts are predicting," says Dr. Rakesh Mehta, an expert hydrologist at the National Institute of Hydrology in Roorkee, who has studied river systems across northern India extensively over his career. "With current infrastructure and flood management practices not keeping pace with climate change trends seen recently – such as rapid snowmelt following unseasonable warm spells – our already vulnerable communities will be under enormous strain if heavy rains persist for long periods of time."

Floods are nothing new to India, where vast areas along the Ganges and Brahmaputra river valleys experience annual flooding in different seasons that can submerge homes, destroy crops as well as sweep away livestock. In fact, according to government statistics compiled over recent years of study into disaster response preparedness by local authorities across northern India's various states; an estimated 120 people were killed and millions displaced during flood events in these areas each year on average since the turn of the century when better record-keeping began for such calamities. Experts say even more lives are lost annually, as well records become harder to obtain because many fatal disasters have gone unreported due to lack of resources or poor communication infrastructure left behind after a flood inundates whole areas at once when rivers overflow their banks which frequently occurs during monsoon season.

Given these alarming forecasts from IMD regarding heavy rain and potential cloudburst, authorities are already taking steps towards better preparations for what might be one of the worst summers on record to hit northern India's water-logged regions since reliable data collection began around 2001 when annual floods were first recorded as such. In some cases where infrastructure development has been able improve living conditions, like in Assam and West Bengal through dredging of riverbed systems which increases capacity for holding back excessive rainfall or overflows at critical points along rivers; others have not fared so well with natural calamities leading to loss when people are caught unaware due lacking warning signs before disaster strikes.

As communities across northern India brace themselves amidst mounting concerns regarding possible flooding this August monsoon season, local officials urge residents who live near rivers and
