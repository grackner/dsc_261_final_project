Athletes at Tokyo's Olympic Village felt an unnerving presence as reports of a ghost sighting started circulating last night among residents and staff alike in the heart of Japan’CTE. A former Olympian, who wishes to remain anonymous due to privacy concerns regarding their current status post-retirement, witnessed what they initially thought was just an elaborate prank playing out on Olympic training fields near where Tokyo's athletes are staying during the 2021 Summer Games (BBC).

"I saw a figure dressed in traditional tracksuits of black and white moving quickly across the field. It looked like someone trying to run but just kept halting suddenly," said Alex Johnson, who was working with event organizers on logistics nearby at Marunouchi Park when they spotted what appeared to be our apparition."

Eyewitsnesses recall seeing a dark figure wearing an old-style uniform before the sighting of several spectral figures in rooms across town. One witness, who is attending as a member of Tokyo's Olympic Organizing Committee, saw these ghostly occurrences firsthand while exploring various facilities yesterday evening (AP).

"I felt quite chilly after hearing tales about this haunting from other staff members," said Kimiko Tanaka. "But I tried to brush it off as just superstition – until tonight."

Reports of sightings began surfacing late last night in Olympic Village apartments and dormitories, where athletes have been residing since arriving at the Tokyo 2021 Games (Yomiuri Shimbun). Residents tell a tale that stretches back to when they first arrived for training camps months ago.

"I heard my roommate scream out last night," said Emily Harris, an American track and field athlete participating in the event. "We were all watching TV on our couches near Hachioji Station until I thought something jumped at us from above." 
Harris's statement is corroborated by witness accounts who recall hearing a soft thud followed immediately by rustling noises coming through an athletics track. Residents of Olympic Village dormitories say they heard sounds eerily reminiscent to the slap-back rhythm and percussion associated with traditional Japanese music played on shamisen (NHK).

The Tokyo Metropolitan Government has not officially issued a statement about sightings, but one official hinted that it may be related to some Olympic athletes' deep respect for Japan’s rich cultural heritage. "We have no reason at the moment other than curiosity," said Taro Yamada of The Organizing Committee in an interview yesterday afternoon after witnessing several specters among fellow staff members (Japan Times).

"The spirit world always finds new avenues to express itself, especially when you bring together such diverse cultures. It's not surprising that we had some unexpected visitors during these Games," said Yamada while visiting athletes and their families yesterday at the opening ceremony held in Fukushima Park (Sun).

A spokesperson for a local haunted house attraction near Marunouchi Station told CNN Tokyo correspondent, "We have seen an increase of visitors lately because these Olympic Games are bringing so much international attention to Japan. Our guests love the history and folklore stories behind each room." 
But experts warn not everyone will be convinced by what they see or hear during their stay
