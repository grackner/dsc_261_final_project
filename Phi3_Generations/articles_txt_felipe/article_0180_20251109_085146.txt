Washington D.C., March 21 — A groundbreCTi ng study on Alzheimer's disease funded by the National Institutes of Health has made a significant discovery that could change how we approach treatment for memory disorders in older adults across America, where millions are affected each year.

The five-year research project, initiated at Johns Hopkins University last fall and involving 500 participants from various demographics with early signs of Alzheimer's or Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), has revealed that a specific combination therapy can slow down the progression by up to two years.

"This is an exceptional breakthrough in our battle against one of society’s most devastating diseases," said Dr. Susan Smith, lead researcher on the Alzheimer's project at Johns Hopkins University and a senior scientist with NIH. "While there are currently no cures for neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's or MCI, our findings show that combination therapies may significantly extend cognitive functioning."

The treatment combines existing medications known to slow the brain plaque buildup and improve neuron health. However, unlike previous treatments focused on a single approach, this study explored how various drugs used together could provide more benefits for patients at earlier stages of memory loss - particularly in delaying progression from MCI or Alzheimer's to severe impairment when it comes time for critical decisions about end-of-life care.

"The combination therapy approach is a novel concept that has shown tremendous promise," says Dr. Eric Thompson, one of the top neurologists in Washington D.C who specializes treating older adults with cognitive disorders at George Washington University Hospital where many study participants were recruited to participate in this national research initiative between 2021 and 2023.

The team found that administering the new drug combination could delay symptom progression by as much as two years, especially when treatment starts before individuals reach advanced stages of cognitive decline. This is based on an average annual rate of Alzheimer's disease advancement which can range from 2 to 3 percent for early-stage patients who experience milder memory loss and slower development in their conditions leading up until they start showing clear signs like difficulty completing daily tasks independently or significant mood changes.

"Although we are still fine-tuning the treatment regimen, these results have already sparked hope among researchers," says Dr. Susan Smith of Johns Hopkins University who's been working with local community centers to recruit participants for this national study that could eventually impact care nationwide once approved by federal regulatory agencies following successful completion in 2025 trials and analyses before public release next year around June/July.

Efforts are currently underway across multiple healthcare centers to roll out a more refined version of this treatment for widespread use once final approval is granted from the FDA by 2026 after thorough review and evaluation based on these groundbreaking findings; furthermore, research teams hope they can eventually offer free or affordable medications that could provide lasting effects in extending quality life span beyond traditional drug treatments alone for memory disorders.
