A fire broke out at a historic inn in Charleston yesterday evening around 8 p.m., just as guests began their nightcap by candlelight before bedtime; the inferno quickly consumed much of the property, leaving behind an overwhelming sense of loss and devastation among those who called it home for years to come. The incident took place at the century-old Magnolia Manor Inn located on Main Street in downtin Charleston (MSA).

This unforeseen catastrophe not only destroyed a significant piece of local heritage but also left many families and friends temporarily displaced, seeking refuge with relatives or staying at nearby hotels. The MSA Fire Department was on the scene within minutes after receiving an emergency call around 8:15 p.m.; however, strong winds from Hurricane Erika have hindered firefighting efforts and prolonged rescue operations well into today's night (MSA time).

"We are doing everything possible to control the situation," MSA Fire Chief Gregory Miller stated during an evening press conference. "Our priority is ensuring public safety, as there were no casualties reported." He later added that they hope to restore power and water lines in affected areas by tomorrow afternoon at the latest.

Erika has left much of Charleston without electricity or potable running water since yesterday morning when it struck; many residents are still trying desperately to salvage what possessions remain after being forced out from their homes due to rising waters and power outages that followed earlier flooding events triggered by Erica.

According to local historian, Dr. Elizabeth Harris: "Magnolia Manor Inn is one of the oldest establishments still standing in downtown Charleston; it has been a symbolic part of our town's rich history for over 100 years." Many people who have shared memories from decades ago about gatherings hosted at this now-infamous building wept as they recalled the loss.

Local business owner, Thomas Richardson commented on seeing firefighters working tirelessly through the night: "It breaks my heart to see our beautiful town in such despair; I hope that everyone affected finds strength and support during this difficult time."

With a citywide curfew implemented at 9 p.m., most of Charleston has been left with no power or potable running water since the hurricane struck yesterday morning, forcing residents to seek shelter elsewhere while working collectively towards rebuilding their homes and businesses alike. As we continue observing developments on this front, it remains crucial that individuals stay vigilant amidst these trying times for themselves and those around them – always remembering that when disaster strikes as hard a storm can in South Carolina, together there is hope even if our path ahead may seem uncertain at first.
