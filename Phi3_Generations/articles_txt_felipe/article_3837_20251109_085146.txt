A recent study by economists has revealed that investors made a substantial profit in last night's stock market session before major technology companies announced significant earnings results this morning. On Thursday afternoon at the New York Stock Exchange, premarket trading saw tech giants like Apple and Amazon hit record high prices as positive expectations circulated within the business community after Wall Street closed for a three-day weekend following Martin Luther King Jr.' endorsement on racial justice reforms.

But early this morning at 9am, news broke of disappointing earnings reports from these tech behemoths that have sent shockwaves throughout the market with Apple's shares dropping by more than three percent and Amazon stock falling nearly six percent in premarket trading on Friday before opening for another session.

"The impact was significant, as investors reacted swiftly to this unexpected news," said Dr. Samuel Peterson, a finance professor at the University of California Los Angeles who has followed tech trends closely over decades. "It's not every day that such an influential part of our economy experiences sudden instability."

Experts say these early losses reflect broader concerns about corporate governance and social responsibility, particularly following increased scrutiny on racial injustice within the tech sector since last month when Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s foundation partnered with prominent Silicon Valley companies to address systemic racism issues that permeate their workforces as well as society at large according to reports by major news outlets like The New York Times and Bloomberg News on Monday evening ahead of this weekend's announcements.

"We have seen investors taking cues from more socially conscious movements such as Black Lives Matter, but now these corporate issues are directly affecting their portfolios," said Jane Anderson, a senior economist with Goldman Sachs who has been studying the intersection of social responsibility and financial markets for years. "The market is starting to realize that without meaningful action towards racial equality in tech workplaces, we could face greater instability."

On Thursday evening following Martin Luther King Jr.'s endorsement on reforms, an estimated $10 billion worth of stock from these companies was bought before the market closed. "We felt confident about our decision to invest pre-market knowing that there were positive developments happening within both tech and social justice sectors," said Charles Thompson, a high net worth individual who purchased shares ahead of Martin Luther King Jr.'s endorsement according to sources at his financial advisor's office.

Friday morning after the initial shockwave sent through Wall Street on Thursday by disappointing earnings results from tech companies like Apple and Amazon, market sentiment continues uncertain amid concerns about corporate governance issues related with racial injustice inside their workplaces as well investor confidence wavers.

As for what comes next - financial analysts say this could be a catalyst for more change within the business sector while regulators may look into potential discrepancies between public statements and internal policies regarding diversity, equity initiatives in light of corporate responsibility to their shareholders as per comments made by senior officials at The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

"We are closely monitoring this situation," said SEC spokesperson Emily Williams. "Any indication that companies aren't living up to societal standards for diversity, equity or inclusion will
