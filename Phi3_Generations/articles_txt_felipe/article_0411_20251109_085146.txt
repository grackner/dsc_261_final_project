As temperatures continue to soar across parts of Southeast Asia this week due to a record-breaking heatwave caused by climate change, health officials are urging people in the region's urban centers to take necessary precautions against potential heatstroke cases and dehydrrances. Experts warn that unless significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are made globally within this year, we may see an increase not only in extreme weather conditions but also a threat to global food security with droughts impacting crop production worldwide as well.[2]

Southeast Asia has been experiencing record-breaking heat for over two weeks now. On Tuesday and Wednesday, temperatures hit an all-time high in the region of 41 degrees Celsius (105.8 Fahrenheit).[3] The National Climate Center reported that "such intense weather conditions are unprecedented" for this time of year.[2][4] In Bangkok, a city known to be sensitive to temperature fluctuations due to its tropical climate and dense population concentrated in urban areas,[5] authorities have opened temporary cooling centers with air-conditioned spaces where people can seek relief from the sweltering heat.

Senior meteorologist Dr. Somsak Limsong, director of weather monitoring at Bangkok's Meteorological Department (BMD), said that "the current conditions are unlike anything we have experienced before," adding he fears for a long-lasting impact on the region if measures aren’t taken soon.[3] As climate change progresses due to increased emissions from human activities, experts say it will continue affect all aspects of our lives and worsen as countries fail to address global warming.

Bangkok's government has declared a state of emergency with strict regulations in place for people working outdoors during this period while also launching campaigns encouraging citizens not only nationwide but across the region, including Malaysia and Singapore, which are experiencing similar heatwaves.[6]

"We have to act now before it's too late," said Dr. Somsak Limsong in an interview with CNN Indonesia after a trip from Bangkok where he met other climate scientists attending the ASEAN Climate Change Workshop held last month underway by Thailand, which is hosting this year as part of its efforts to lead regional initiatives against global warming.[4]

Health officials in Malaysia have reported an increase in heatstroke cases and advised locals on how best to protect themselves from harmful effects. In Singapore, authorities also opened public cooling centers while stressing the need for long-term adaptation strategies towards climate change mitigation measures.[7] Experts agree that unless significant reductions are made within this year in global emissions levels – currently well over 25 billion tons annually from industrialized nations alone — we will see a continuance of extreme weather events and their devastating effects on human health, economies worldwide, wildlife habitats,[8] food production[9], among others.

"The Earth is sending us an urgent message through this heatwave," said Professor Adeline Yuen-Wai Wong from the Sustainable Energy Center in Singapore during a virtual conference last week.[7][10] "We can't ignore its consequences anymore."
