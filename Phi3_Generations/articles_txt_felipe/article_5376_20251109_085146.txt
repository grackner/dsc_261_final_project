A soccer match-day mishap shook up a local youth league in Austin, Texas yesterday when an overzealous fan accidentally knocked down half of their team's goalpost during the pregame festivities at Barton Springs Soccer Complex around noon on Saturday. The incident left players and officials scrambling as they tried to find alternatives for Sunday’s match-up while attempting not to dampen the young athletes’ spirits.

“It was a complete accident,” said 14-year-self Lance Crosby, whose team's goalpost collapsed after being struck by Austin resident John Doe during pregame festivities. “I couldn’t believe my eyes when I saw it fall over.” The fan claims that he had never been to the field before and did not intend for any damage; instead of walking around him, players decided on an impromptu penalty shootout as a replacement activity with equal participation from both teams involved in Crosby's match.

The 12-year-old Austin native Ethan Martinez said that he thought it would be best for the team to still get some game time despite what happened earlier, “We didn’t want this incident affecting us too much.” Accordingly, officials at Barton Springs Soccer Complex are now working closely with local charities and community organizations in an effort to provide replacement equipment.

Incidents such as these emphasize the need for better communication between fans and teams during pregame activities says Austin YMCA's director of sports development Mike Roberts; “It’s a reminder that everyone involved should be mindful not just about themselves but also how their actions can unintentionally affect others.” 

The soccer community in Austin is rallying together to support Crosby and the other teams affected by this mishap. Many of these local organizations are working collaboratively with coaches, parents, players, league officials as well as fans alike on a fundraising effort that will provide new goal posts for all youth soccer fields in Austin while also ensuring improved fence design to prevent similar accidents from occurring again in the future.

The Crosby boys' team is set to meet with their coach next weekend, where they hope this unfortunate incident won’t affect them too much as well says Ethan Martinez; “We are just here for soccer and don’t want anything happening that makes us feel bad.” The rest of the league will also have its meeting in a few days to discuss any additional measures needed across other fields.

Fans, parents, coaches, players from all Austin youth leagues continue supporting one another as they look forward with hope towards Sunday's match-ups after ensuring that this unfortunate incident won’t affect the young athletes too much and will not be remembered for long in our soccer community.
