EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced on Thursday that a major new blockchain-based initiative will be launched to tackle financial fraud in Europe by next year. The program is set to provide secure transactions across borders, with potential benefits for small and medium businesses alike. 

In an interview today, von der Leyen stated: "Blockchain technology has immense promise when it comes to increasing transparency and reducing corruption within financial systems." According to EU officials working on the project alongside industry experts from across Europe, this initiative is crucial as European countries continue to recover economically post-pandemic.

The ambitious €20 million ($24M) plan will focus initially on sectors most affected by fraudulent practices such as insurance claims and cross-border payments between businesses in different EU states, with the pilot program set to commence next year across three countries: France, Spain, and Italy.

"This project represents an unprecedented move towards a more secure economic future for our small and medium enterprises (SMEs),” said Finance Minister Carlos Canales from Mexico City who will serve as one of the consultants on this EU-backed endeavor alongside his Mexican colleague, Santiago Gordo.

Experts in blockchain technology estimate that fraud cases within these sectors alone may amount to €10 billion ($12B) annually across Europe – a significant sum for many businesses operating small profit margins which struggle even more during economic downturns like the COVID-19 pandemic. By streamlining and fortifying transactional processes, this blockchain initiative will not only bring down costs but also prevent fraudulent activities that can ruin a promising enterprise for good in just one stroke of malintent or error on behalf of an unscrupulous individual taking advantage while everyone else struggles to recover.

Maria Rios, CEO of SMEs United Europe and President Elect at Euro-Blockchain Alliance, shared her excitement: “This initiative will be a game changer for small businesses operating across borders in our diverse continent.” She adds that "the project’s success depends on the cooperation between all countries involved."

The EU Commission has allocated €10 million ($12M) as seed funding to get this groundbreaking initiative off the ground, with an additional €10 million earmarked for research and development by leading blockchain firms. This investment signals a major commitment towards utilizing advanced technology in combating financial fraud across Europe’s small businesses which will be vital as we continue to see growth amidst economic uncertainty brought about by the pandemic, climate change threats or other unforeseen crises on our horizon; but with this new blockchain initiative underway next year — one that could potentially cut out fraudsters and bring relief for those in need.

The EU Commission is confident that a positive outcome of this project will not only bolster trust between trading partners across Europe, enabling more robust economic activities throughout the continent but also set an example to other global regions keen on using technology as leverage against financial malpractice and corruption which continues to plague our world.

This comes just a few months after Germany announced it is increasing its support for blockchain start-ups in their bid towards building up digital infrastructure that helps secure European enterprises from economic threats, most recently cyber attacks on power grids or
