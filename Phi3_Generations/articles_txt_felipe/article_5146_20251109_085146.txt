In a groundbredependent study from Oxford University Medical School released this morning, it is confirmed that Alzheimer's disease symptoms can be halted for up to five years in over half of the early-stage patients when treated with an innovative drug combination before cognitive decline becomes irreversible. The treatment trials were conducted on 250 participants diagnosed within three years who exhibited mild to moderate Alzheimer's symptoms at six major hospitals across England, from January to December of the previous year.

Professor Jane Smith, lead researcher and head of neurodegenerative diseases studies at Oxford University Medical School, shared her excitement about their findings: "This is a remarkable step forward in our fight against Alzheimer's Disease—a disease that robs individuals not just of memory but also the ability to engage fully with life as they know it."

The study focused on developing and testing three different drug therapies designed specifically for halting or slowing cognitive decline in early-stage Alzheimer's patients. These drugs were then administered intravenously alongside standard care during the initial stages of diagnosis, before significant damage occurred to brain tissue.

Participants who received treatment showed a halt in their mental deterioration and even some improvement over time compared with control groups that did not receive any experimental therapies—an outcome researchers could hardly believe at first glance but are now celebrating as hopeful progress against one of the most devastating diseases affecting older adults today.

"Alzheimer's disease has plagued society for decades with no definitive cure in sight," said Dr Michael Green, a senior neurologist who worked on the trial alongside Professor Smith at Bristol Royal Infirmary Hospital and other institutions involved in the study worldwide. "However today we can finally provide hope that early intervention may halt its progression."

Despite these promising results announced this morning by Oxford University researchers, experts warn more studies are needed before widescale implementation of their findings becomes possible—especially considering potential side effects like increased blood pressure or changes in behavior among other risks associated with experimental therapies. Nonetheless, patients and families alike have expressed gratitude for this pioneering research that offers a glimmer of hope where none existed before:

"Taking my father's Alzheimer's diagnosis seriously has been an emotional rollercoaster," said Lisa Jones to the BBC. "If doctors had caught his symptoms earlier, perhaps it could have made all the difference for him—we can only hope that others may benefit from these treatments too."

In conclusion, while researchers are excited by their latest breakthroughs and see potential applications across numerous countries worldwide if further studies validate them conclusively as safe effective therapies in preventing or delaying irreversible cognitive decline due to Alzheimer's disease—the journey is far from over. As scientists plan for Phase II trials next year involving hundreds more participants, both patients and loved ones continue waiting on the horizon of hopeful discoveries promising better outcomes against this cruel thief stealing memories piece by precious memory-filled piece:

"If we can stop Alzheimer's in its tracks early enough to preserve quality of life for our cherished elders," said Tom Harrison, patient advocate and caregiver at St George’
