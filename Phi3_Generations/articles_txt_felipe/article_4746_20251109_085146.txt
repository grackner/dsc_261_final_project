In a stunning display of athleticism and teamwork at Texas Tech University last Friday night, Austin's Red Raiders overcame heavy odds to secure a narrow victory in the Big 12 Championship game against rival Oklahoma State Cowboys by scoring with just seconds left on the clock. The pulsating energy resonated through Cotton Bowl Stadium as the Red Raiders clinched their place among college football'selite'.


The win, achieved after a back-and-forth struggle that saw both teams exchange touchdowns, came in an electric finale where Texas Tech quarterback Jackson Foster threw for two crucial first downs. The last one was completed with just 10 seconds left on the clock as he passed to wideout Marcus Lopez for a short but decisive gain of five yards setting up Jake Smith at the goal line, who secured their win by scoring a touchdown that ultimately made all the difference.


"This has been an incredible journey," said Foster after leading his team into victory "We've had to overcome some tough challenges on and off the field throughout this season, but we were always motivated enough as individuals and together as a unit not to give up."


Despite being considered underdogs coming in with odds of -105 against them by many sportsbooks before kickoff, Austin's crowd was unyielding. Fans decked the stadium out in Red Raider gear and their relentless cheers kept players like Marcus Lopez focused despite pressure from Oklahoma State’s defense who managed to limit Texas Tech only one touchdown throughout the game as of right now, with five total on offense after just 50 minutes.


Senior linebacker Brendan Simmons praised his team's ability in a post-game interview: "Everyone knows we were outgunned and had to overcome many challenges throughout the season but I am proud of how my team fought till the end, every single down." 

The win was no small feat; with Texas Tech playing just their second game after declaring forfeit in a previously lost match at Oklahoma last week. Despite being ranked No.15 nationally by ESPN/Rossreports and having only begun play this season alongside other freshman class, coach Bill Lee has been lauded as an outstanding mentor during these trying times: "The way the kids came together to fight for what they believe in shows me that I have a very special team. As their head coach it is my duty and honor to ensure we reach our potential."

Texas Tech now set's course towards Big 12 Championship Weekend, where more battles lie ahead as the Red Raiders face Kansas State next Wednesday at home before heading into New Mexico for a quarterfinal game on Thursday. Coach Lee remains focused: "We have shown today that we are not to be underestimated and I am confident my team can continue this momentum through Big 12 Championship Weekend."
