A severe heatwave sweeping across northern and western China has left thousands of people struggling to cope with temperatures reaching upwards of 120 degrees Fahrenheit in parts of Inner Mongolia over the past week, according to official meteorological records released yesterday by Chinese authorities. The extreme weather conditions are expected to continue into next month despite cooler winds bringing some relief from recent days.

The most affected areas include Xilinhot and Hohot in Inner Mongolia as well as Liaoning province’s Shenyang city, where temperatures reached record-breaking high of 127 degrees Fahrenheit yesterday morning before easing to around 90 by evening with the aid of strong wind systems. Official statistics estimate that at least three people have died and hundreds more were taken ill due to heatstroke or dehydrthation in these regions, as per reports from local healthcare providers.

Efforts are being made across affected areas for immediate relief measures such as opening emergency cooling centers while officials urge citizens not to leave their homes unless absolutely necessary between 10 AM and 4 PM when temperatures peak dangerously high, CNN Asia correspondent Sarah Jones reports from Xilinhot.

"It's like living in an oven," said a local resident who wished to remain anonymous fearing repercussions for speaking out against the authorities amid growing criticism on social media platforms about perceived insufficient response by government officials, he adds that his family has been staying indoors as much as possible and limit themselves only when absolutely necessary due to work commitments.

Local healthcare facilities are overwhelmed with patients suffering from heat-related illnesses while struggling with limited resources such as water shortages caused by increased consumption amid the crisis, observers note that local authorities have not yet acknowledged these concerns in their public statements but maintain regular checkups on residents and enforcing mandatory temperature checks at entry points to large gatherings.

Experts say a rare heatwave like this one is becoming increasingly common due climate change effects with scientists predicting an increase of such events around Asia as global temperatures rise, although officials have remained tight-lipped on the matter despite growing international pressure for more transparency in their response to extreme weather conditions.

Environmental activist Li Mengyu spoke out during a recent protest demanding better heat mitigation measures and government accountability: "We understand that this is an unprecedented event, but our people are suffering immensely without proper support from authorities - it's high time for them to act," she lamented.

The National Meteorological Center announced yesterday evening its plan for distributing cooling centers across severely affected cities along with water supplies while urging citizens not take more than a two-liter bottle per person at once due to shortages caused by increased demand, as many businesses and factories remain shut down in an attempt to reduce energy consumption during the heatwave.

CNN Asia is following this developing story closely from Beijing with additional correspondents on ground covering other impacted areas including Shenyang city and neighboring Heilongjiang province where temperatures reached a record-breaking 127 degrees Fahrenheit yesterday before easing today, while authorities continue to reassure citizens of safety measures in place amid growing concerns over lackluster government response so far.
