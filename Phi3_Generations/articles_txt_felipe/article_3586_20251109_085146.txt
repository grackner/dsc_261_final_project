"CNN Sportscaster: 'It's been a whirlwind of activity in our city as we watched history unfold at Madison Square Garden this weekend.' In basketball terms that everyone understands and appreciates, the New York Knicks faced off against the Brooklyn Nets for what could potentially be one of the most anticipated games on Monday night.


The buzz started building when Anthony Davis' commitment was announced at Madison Square Garden last Thursday evening (7/14), sending shockwaves through both fan bases and within pundit circles, as they prepare for a high-octane battle between two of the most storied franchises in NBA history. The Knicks are coming off their worst home loss to date against New Orleans Pelicans last Wednesday (7/12), where an 83-90 defeat left fans wanting more when it came time to watch Derrick Fournier lead his team as he finished with a personal best of seven points.

"This is about showcasing the resilience and grit that this city embodies," said Mayor Eric Adams at Friday's pre-game press conference, where both teams were on hand along with their respective players to rally support for New York City as they prepare for a big game against Miami Heat starting Sunday evening (7/16).

Knicks guard Derrick Fournier spoke after practice yesterday about the energy in Madison Square Garden: "There's an electricity here that I can feel. The fans are behind us and we know this is going to be a big night for everyone." Both teams have been practicing together on Friday mornings, with New York City hosting these sessions since Wednesday (7/13).

Brooklyn'in Heat captain Jimmy Butler said his team appreciates the city coming out in droves: "We know we’re going to compete for a win and not just anything. It gives us an extra boost knowing that everyone is behind Brooklyn." Meanwhile, Knicks coach Tom Gores sees this as another opportunity to inspire change after last week's loss when he addressed the players beforehand at Madison Square Garden: "We are in New York City for a reason and we have each other. Let’s show why they call us The Streak!"

As both teams continue practicing together, city officials urge fans to follow all health guidelines amidst an ongoing COVID-19 pandemic which has prompted the NBA to implement various protocols for safety at home and away games alike. New York City is looking forward with hopeful anticipation of Monday night's game as it continues its rich tradition in basketball history, while aiming towards a stronger comeback on court next season."
