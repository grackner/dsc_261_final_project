In a surprising turn of events at this year's Winter Olympic Games in Beijing, two athletes were disqualified for alleged doping violations just hours before they would have competed against each other on the ice rink to vie for gold medals. As spectators held their breath and cameras froze momentarily with anticipation of a medal clash between American speed skater Jessica Long and Canadian long track speedskater Laurent Dignef, officials made an unexpected announcement just before 10:30 am local time on February 9th that both athletes had been removed from the competition.

Jessica Long expressed her disappointment in a brief interview after being pulled out of today's women’ endurance event at Yan Qing Oi ice rink, saying, "I train every single day to reach my goals and it hurts when I see these unfair practices going on." Meanwhile, Laurent Dignef told reporters that he had no idea what was happening until the officials came up with their decision: "It's frustrating not knowing if we were ever cleared for competition in this event. We never saw anything suspicious; my team and I always follow our regimen to perfection."

An Olympic Committee spokesperson revealed that positive doping test results had been found on both athletes, which led the officials from Beijing Anti-Doping Agency (BADA) in collaboration with World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) to immediately revoke their participation. The decision was announced shortly after an unannounced surprise test conducted at Yan Qing Oi ice rink on February 9th, where the athletes were allegedly found in possession of banned substances from a classified list shared by WADA and BADA officials during this year's Winter Olympics.

Olympic regulations prohibit any doping activity at all times leading up to an athlete’s event start, but with the complexity surrounding modern-day sports science, it appears that unintentional or not, these two athletes found themselves in serious trouble just days before they were scheduled for competition. Their fate has raised concerns among other competitors who fear doping tests might be conducted more frequently and at any time during their stay to ensure fair play across all disciplines of the Winter Olympics Games being held on this continent-spanning event that now spans 20,018 square kilometers in Beijing.

IOC President Thomas Bach made a statement later today expressing his disappointment but understanding: "It is truly regrettable when athletes who follow doping rules are disqualified due to mistakes or misunderstandings related with drug use." He continued, saying that he hopes this event will encourage the Olympic movement as well other sports organizations across the world to continue working together in promoting a clean and fair competitive environment for all participating nations.

The officials from BADA have not yet released any official statement explaining why these athletes found themselves on the sidelines, but rumors among local coaches say both may lack proper guidance regarding doping regulations or medication taken outside competition hours in order to improve their performances during practice sessions and recovery. Despite this news, International Speed Skating Federation (ISU) President Boris Becker stated that they will continue with a stringent policy of surprise drug tests across all disciplines at these Games: "The safety and fairness for athletes should never be compromised."
