In an unprecedented move that'thrilled and confused fans alike, Pittsburgh Steelers star receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster scored a record ten touchdown receptions in the last regular season game of his career on Sunday night at Heinz Field. This feat, set during Week 18 against the Baltimore Ravens, propelled the team into playoff contention and solidified juju as one of the most versatile receivers to ever suit up for Steelers history with this extraordinary achievement now etched in NFL lore at a mere touchdown’s distance.

Smith-Schuster's astonishing season ended on an epic high note, having already been recognized as AFC Offensive Player of the Week earlier that same night following his five previous TD receptions by kickoff time and adding another two in stunning fashion against Baltimore Ravens during their Thursday Night Football encounter. It was a display so spectacular it has left NFL pundits reeling, with many wondering how such an astonishing feat could happen without controversy or objection from league officials at the start of 2023 season; after all he's still on pace for more than five TD receptions this year.

"Juju was just lightning fast and incredibly accurate in finding open space as well," said Steelers coach Mike Tomlin during postgame coverage, "his ability to read defenses has been a true asset throughout his tenure here." With Smith-Schuster leading the way for him through hard work on defense and special teams he's proven himself one of few players in NFL history able not only throw touchdown passes but also score them without ever playing quarterback.

Stepping into football form after missing significant time last season, JuJu set his personal best before this game with 12 TD receptions overall and finished the night strong against Baltimore Ravens (56-38), while leading Pittsburgh back to within one touchdown when he scored an impressive third in a span of two minutes during first half kickoff sequence just moments after scoring twice earlier.

"Juju's ability to deliver on crucial plays is unmatched," said teammate and fellow wideout Chase Claypool, recalling his memorable contributions against Baltimore Ravens last night when JuJu caught four passes including the third touchdown reception during that historic first-half kickoff sequence. "It was evident he could do no wrong with Tomlin's offensive approach as we have watched him elevate our play this season and make us a formidable force."

As Smith-Schuster prepares to enter retirement after next Sunday’s AFC Wild Card game, his record ten touchdown receptions remains an unmatched achievement in NFL history. His legacy will continue inspiring generations of young players who aspire nothing less than greatness at the highest level possible for any athlete'

The Steelers organization expressed profound gratitude towards JuJu Smith-Schuster and his phenomenal performance during season finale against Baltimore Ravens in which he scored an astounding record ten touchdown receptions. Head of Sports Marketing, David Duffey stated that "it’s a testament to both Juju's skillset as well this team being able bring out the best in players." Smith-Schuster is now set to hang up his cleats after completing an all-time record streak for touchdown reception by any Steeler throughout regular seasons since 196
