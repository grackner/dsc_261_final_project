In an electrifying performance at Madison Square Garden last night, Michael Jordan's Chicago Bulls secured a historic victory against LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers with a final score of 108-95 on Thursday evening in Game 7. This dramatic win cemented their place as one of the greatest teams ever to grace the NBA stage, capturing home court advantage going into the next series against LeBron' extratellings and his teammates exhorted each other during timeouts about staying focused on what needed done rather than dwelling on past disappointments. 

"The guys are hungry for success," said Bulls coach Phil Jackson afterward, who took charge of the bench bosses role in Chicago since they lost to LeBron's team back-to-back seasons ago and have not tasted such triumph again."It was a special night where we came out with our game faces on full display," he added. 

Game highlights included Jordan scoring twenty points, followed by his trusted trio of Scottie Pippen (18), Dennis Rodman (9) along with Horace Grant at double figures for Chicago while LeBron led Cavaliers' counterpart James Harden racked up a career-high 27 points and ten rebounds. Notably, Michael Jordan cemented his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history by ending this series scoring fifty three total points across both games — an incredible feat that stood unrivaled for over two decades before Kobe Bryant surpassed it last year against Cleveland's Cavaliers. 

"I couldn't believe my eyes as I saw Jordan and his teammates come out in full force tonight," said a beaming LeBron James, who shook hands with Michael after exiting the arena on Chicago’ s public bus following their heated exchange earlier during last night’s first half. "They know how to play basketball and they sure showed us today." 

The Bulls' triumph not only rekindled memories of Jordan’s prime but also brought joy back into neighborhood homes across the Windy City after several tough losses recently, which have caused concern among some residents about increased violent crime in the city. "It's incredible to see basketball bring so much happiness and excitement once again," said local business owner Maria Sanchez as she watched fans on Chicago streets cheering for their heroes while her own storefront boasts a replica Michael Jordan jersey inside its window display prominently displayed alongside other NBA memorabilia.

With the championship at stake, both teams will now prepare themselves mentally and physically going into Game 6 in Cleveland on Sunday evening where once again LeBron James' Cavaliers are considered favorites after their recent win over Toronto last night—but not by everyone who was watching tonight thinks this series is anyone’s to lose. "This Bulls team has shown grit, determination and the ability to deliver under pressure," says sports commentator Robert Smith as he wraps up his recap on the game for Fox Sports Channel while interviewing from inside Madison Square Garden after witnessing firsthand what was a historic night in NBA history that many are calling 'The Night of Legends.'
