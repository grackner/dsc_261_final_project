Israeli forces have foiled an attack on a military base in northern Israel by dismantling two makeshift explosives devices that were hidden inside garbage bins and parked cars within the Gaza Strip's al-Shati Refugee Camp, according to officials. The planned assault took place early Monday morning near Kibbutz Beit Orik close to the border with Egypt and Hamas.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed that two Palestinians from nearby villages were captured after they attempted a daring strike on IDF soldiers patrolling in armored vehicles along the Rafah-Israel border fence inside Gaza Strip's al-Shati refugee camp, about 10 kilometers west of Aswan. The alleged terrorists had been surveilling military bases and gathering intelligence for weeks before their arrest last week when they were caught in a routine search by the IDF soldiers patrolling around Kibbutz Beit Orik near Rafah-Israel border fence early Monday morning (14:30 local time).

“Our security forces have been working tirelessly to keep our people safe from such dangerous threats,” said Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Benny Gantz during a press conference in Tel Aviv. “These arrests are vital steps toward ensuring peace and stability for all parties involved.”

Ghassan Daghlas, the Palestinian Authority spokesman denied any involvement from his side while condemning what he described as an act of terrorism against innocent civilis in Gaza. “We urge international media outlets not to fuel regional tensions by spreading false accusations about our people,” Daghlas stated at the United Nations Security Council yesterday (Monday).

The military base, which includes a main compound for troops and armored vehicles as well as additional support units such as cooks, maintenance crews, medical staff, administrative personnel, and others is located near Rafah-Israel border fence about 10 kilometers west of Aswan. The IDF operates several military bases in the region to bolster security along Israel's borders with Egypt and Gaza Strip as well maintain defensive capabilities during hostilities between Fatah, Hamas factions inside Palestinian territories or against any external threat coming from neighboring states such as Iran.

Al-Shati refugee camp in southern Gaza Strip is home to about 40,000 people who fled Sinai Peninsula following Israeli occupation of Egypt's northern coastline back in the late sixties and early seventies. Most residents are descendants from families that were forcibly displaced by Israel during Operation Badr (the October War) when Hamas forces took over control inside Gaza Strip while resisting to Israeli occupation along Sinai Peninsula which led Fatah movement taking command in the West Bank. The Palestinian Authority controls administration of PA-controlled territories including Bethlehem, Hebron and several other cities within Occupied West Bank under a temporary ceasefire agreement between Israelis officials since January 1967 when Egypt announced that it would block Israeli access to the Suez Canal.

“I have lived in al-Shati Refugee Camp for my entire life, witnessing its turbulent history as we struggled through many wars and conflicts over decades,” says Mariam Mohammed Salameh, a 63
