ATHENS (CNN) Athens' world-famous Acropolis is set to open a new exhibition dedicated to the mysterious Minoan civilization, as archaeologists reveal unprecedent findings from their latest excavation on Crete. The groundbreaking exhibit at the Archaeological Museum of Athens will be available starting August 15 and is expected to attract thousands of history enthusiasts every weekend through its opening in September, according to Hellenic Ministry officials.

The Minoan civilization thrived on Crete between 2600 BCE and 1400 BCE before extending across the Aegean Sea into other Cycladic islands as well as mainland Greece during what is known today as the Neopalatial period (circa 1700-1450 BC).

Excavations led by Dr. Elena Papadopoulos, Director of Research at the Acropolis Museum and Associate Professor in Classical Archaeology from the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, have unearthed rare Minoan artifacts such as frescoes depicting bull-leaping rituals. These findings are shedding new light on how this enigmatic civilization lived during their golden age — a period marked by remarkable artistic and architectural accomplishments that inspired the myth of Dawn's arrival in Athens through Zeus’ thunderbolts, as recounted by ancient historian Herodotus.

"I am honored to be leading this team with such dedicated archaeologists who are unearthing treasures from thousands of years ago," said Dr. Papadopoulos during a press conference in Athens on Monday evening outside the Acropolis Museum headquarters, where artifacts and 3D-scanned images will soon go live for public viewing online as well through an interactive web exhibit funded by philanthropists Eleonora Vasilakou and Dimitrios Georgopoulos.

"We're excited to share these discoveries with people worldwide, bringing Minoan culture closer than ever before," she continued while pointing at replica gold jewelry unearthed earlier this summer on Crete that was expertly crafted using mineral-based pigments such as iron oxide and manganese. "The intricate details reveal their mastery of metalworking during the Aegean Bronze Age, providing a fascinating link to contemporary societies."

Dr. Andreas Nikolaou from Harvard University's Classical Archaeology Department has been invited by Dr. Papadopoulos as an expert consultant for this project that highlights human history and innovation in artistry beyond modern boundaries — especially within the Acropolis complex, one of UNESCO World Heritage Sites since 1987 with significant archaeological discoveries at its heart on top-tier Mount Hymettos.
