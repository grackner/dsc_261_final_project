A fire that broke out in a Los Angeles high-rise last night injured three celebrities and left them without their homes for an undetermined time as they recover from smoke inhalation injuries at the nearby Cedars Sinai Medical Center, reports CNN. Firefiginflares sporadally around 1am on November 5th within a five-story section of Los Angeles' Luxe Tower condominium complex located off Rodeo Drive and Wilshire Boulevard where well-known figures reside; no fatalities were reported among the residents, but at least three individuals sustained second-degree burns along with other respiratory damage.

Dr. Samantha Jones of Cedars Sinai says: "Thankfully we have made significant progress in treating our patients tonight." The firefighters worked tirelessly to extinguish the blaze, which they believe was caused by faulty wiring within one of the units; all residents evacuated safely.

"The smoke alarms went off early this morning and we immediately fled outdoors," says resident Michael Thompson who lives on the 12th floor where most celebrities reside, "We waited outside for over an hour as firefighters worked to put it all back together." According to one of Cedars Sinai's medical staff: "The majority were discharged within a few hours after initial treatment; two individuals require extended care in intensive therapy units. They are expected to be on the road to recovery by December 15th and will likely need physical rehabilitation."

Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti has sent his sympathies for those affected, stating: "Our city stands with them during this difficult time as they work towards restoring their lives and properties. I wish our firefighters a safe return to duty after such an arduous effort today; may God continue to bless Los Angeles." Cedars Sinai has offered free medical assistance, including medication for the burn victims who are expected not only physical but emotional as well being discharged into damaged residences that they've called home.

The LA Fire Department is continuing its investigation on Friday afternoon to determine what sparked this early morning fire which was deemed a "sophisticated arson." Multiple eyewitness accounts claim seeing an unfamiliar individual wearing dark clothing and carrying tools throughout the Luxe Tower area during earlier hours of November 4th. As more information is made public, authorities urge anyone with knowledge to come forward for questioning starting next week; this will include surveillance footage from nearby businesses as well as phone records traced back at least six months ago when several celebrities attended charity events hosted by a controversial political figure.

"The investigation has been exhaustive and thorough, but I'm optimistic we can get to the bottom of this," LA Fire Chief Daniel Rodriguez said in an interview with reporters during rounds at Cedars Sinai Friday morning; his team continues working closely alongside investigators from Internal Affairs Bureau (IAB) who were called upon last night by Los Angeles District Attorney George Gascón to assist their ongoing probe into arson-related homicides which have claimed lives in other parts of the state. A spokesperson for IAB confirms that multiple interviews are scheduled throughout this weekend, adding: "The team is currently reviewing all evidence and has
