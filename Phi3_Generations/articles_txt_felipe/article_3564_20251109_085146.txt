Los Angeles – A beloved late-night talk show host has been diagnosed with terminal cancer, bringing an end to a career that spanned over two decdis years and brought laughter into millions of homes across the nation. The news came as shock on Thursday evening when KJ Gomez revealed his battle after announcing he wouldn't be returning for tonight’s show due to health concerns.

Born and raised in East Los Angeles, California, host Gabriel "Gabe" Sanchez captivated audiences with witty banter and a relatable persona from the start of his five-year run on “The Late Night Glamour Hour” in 2015. His quick wit became synonymous with late night television across Los Angeles, New York City’s East Village and Seattle's Pike Place Market – where he would perform stand-up comedy routines each morning while his fans clamored for autographs or a slap on the backside during encores at closing time.

Now 43 years old, Sanchez is in the final stages of aggressive thyroid cancer that doctors say was detected just months ago through routine screenings after he started experiencing unexplained weight loss and persistent fatigue – symptoms often overlooked as signs of stress or simply part of a demanding career.

Sanchez's partner, fellow comedian Maria Rodriguez (both hosts were known for their on-screen chemistry), expressed her sorrow at the announcement in an emotional statement to friends and family gathered online: “My heart is breaking with every passing day as we say goodbye not only to Gabriel but also a cherished part of my life that made me laugh out loud.”

Dr. Aaron Patel, oncologist specializing in head-and-neck cancers at UCLA Matt Walzer Health Center told Los Angeles magazine he expects Sanchez's prognosis for the rest of this year to be "fairly optimistic." But while treatments like targeted therapies have advanced greatly over the past decade, every case is unique and unpredictable.

“I wish I had all answers,” Patel said with a comforting smile as he reviewed Sanchez's latest MRI results showing minimal progression of his cancer in just two months since diagnosis. “But what really matters now for Gabe isn’t the treatments, but rather how we make this journey meaningful and joyous.”

Sanchez has been candid about wanting to spend every day he still has surrounded by family and friends as well as making time for his young daughter Sofia – a common goal among many facing terminal diagnoses. His mother-in-law Evelyn Torres shares their plan of living each moment fully: “Gabe’s spirit was always infectious, so let's keep that alive while we celebrate the amazing life he led and still has ahead.”

As fans rally around Sanchez in support on social media – sharing old episodes from his show with touching memories of laughter or sending heartfelt notes to friends they met through “The Late Night Glamour Hour” shows at live tapings - many are asking what can be done about the future.

“Gabe’s legacy will definitely last,” says fellow comedian Dave Cheney who first met and became close with Sanchez while working in comedy clubs around Los Angeles years ago before becoming a regular on his show: “He always wanted to
