As violence continues to escalate in Venezuela's capital city of Caracas following a national election dispute on November 30th, international concern is mounting over the humanitarian crisis unfolding before our eyes. Tensions have risen since President Nicolas Maduro allegedly won re-election by an approximate margin of less than one percent - claims contested heavily with opposition leader Juan Guaidó demanding a recount on November 24th after accusations that vote tamperings occurred, which his supporters consider to be the catalyst for civil unrest and violence.

The UN has reported multiple deaths amid clashes between security forces loyalist Maduro's regime and opposition Guaidó-backed protesters since November 30th when a nationwide curfew was imposed in response to ongoing disruptions, which have seen more than hundreds of injuries with many people left homeless due to lootings by both sides.

Economic turmoil has been worsened as the country's already fragile banking system faces an influx of counterfeit currency being hoarded within ATM machines amidst fears of hyperinflation, which was last seen in 1985 during Venezuela’s so-called 'Great Recession.' As per a local economist interviewed by CNN on November 26th, Dr. Maria Gomez: "The counterfeit currency is creating an impossible situation for the Venezuelan people - they can't trust their own money."

International communities have called out against any form of violence and democratic rights violations with statements made by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on November 28th, stating: "The United States remains deeply concerned about the continuing unrest in Venezuela...we call for all parties to act responsibly."

However, local activists feel that their voices have been suppressed as Maduro's regime has tightened its grip over freedom of speech and expression. Local human rights advocate Jose Hernandez shared his thoughts with CNN on November 26th: "We are fighting for democracy in our country; the government needs to understand this."

As Venezuelan communities brace themselves against a backdrop that is increasingly uncertain, international organizations continue their efforts and appeals towards establishing peaceful resolutions. Amidst escalating concerns of both sides taking matters into self-defense actions as well humanitarian aid being provided by various countries to support those affected within the nation has become imperative for all parties involved in this crisis with more than 2 million Venezuelans currently seeking refuge overseas according to UNHCR.

The world now waits, holding its breaths hoping that peace and democracy prevail before it’s too late - a hope held by citizens within Venezuela as well as those who believe themselves responsible for the fate of their neighbors across borders where solidar0ty has never been more needed than in times such as this.
