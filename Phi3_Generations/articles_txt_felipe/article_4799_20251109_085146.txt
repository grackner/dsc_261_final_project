A fire broke out at The Grand Hotel in Miami Beach late Thursday evening, causing extensive damage to one of Florida's premier luxury resorts and leaving guests displaced while investigators determined the cause of ignition. Witnesses reported hearing a loud explosion followed by intense heat emanating from room 504 around 10 pranctical time (local) before firefighters arrived on site at about 2:30 PM local, Miami-Dade Fire Rescue spokesman stated.

The Grand Hotel is renowned for its opulent accommodations and prime location along the glamorous oceanfront stretch of South Beach known as Worth Avenue. This three-star establishment had a capacity to host 250 guests with overnight rates starting at $398 per night, according to their official website's pricing information.

"The Grand Hotel has been serving Miami and its visitors for decades," said an employee who spoke on condition of anonymity as the property reeled under damage control efforts amidst national headlines about luxury hotels in turmoil worldwide, "and we all hope it will rise stronger from this calamity."

As emergency responders battled flames that engulfed several floors above and below room 504 where guests were staying at the time of the blaze, officials urged hotel patrons to remain calm as they coordinated safe evacuations.

He has since issued statements urging patience while his team of fire damage restoration specialists evaluate property integrity, safety concerns before reopening doors to guests.
