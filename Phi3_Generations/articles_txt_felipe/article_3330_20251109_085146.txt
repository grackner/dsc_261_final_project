In a historic moment for space tourism, billionaire entrepreneur Jeff Bezos became the first person to board and travel abostatic rocket on July 12th from Florida's Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in an unpiloted flight that lasted nearly ten minutes before safely returning. As part of Blue Origin's New Shepherd program, the venture marks a significant milestone for commercial space travel and opens possibilities for future private voyages beyond Earth’s atmosphere.

The successful launch was met with cheers from family members who accompanied Bezos to Launch Site One in Florida as well as supporters watching live online coverage worldwide. “I think about all the scientists, engineers — everybody here that worked on this mission,” said John Yemane, a systems engineer and witness at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS). "When they got together to pull it off today, I was just so proud of them."

Blue Origin's New Shepherd rocket carried the 70-year-old Bezos – along with his wife Dorothy and son Hudson. The trio experienced weightlessness as soon as they departed from Earth’s atmosphere before their return capsule landed safely back on site One just five minutes later, around 1:45 pm local time (9:30 am ET).

This launch comes nearly two years after Blue Origin announced plans to send tourists into space for $28 million per seat. The company has since then made progress with its New Shepherd suborbital rocket development program while conducting frequent test flights and refining aspects of their vehicle design such as life support, cabin pressurization systems, parachute deployment mechanisms among others to ensure maximum safety for future crews aboard commercial spaceflight missions.

Speaking before his recent flight experience during an interview on CNN's "New Day," Jeff Bezos expressed optimism about the industry’s direction: “We believe that everyone will have access eventually, whether as a tourist or to launch experiments.” He continued by saying he was excited for this first step towards making space accessible and affordable.

Space experts see Blue Origin's New Shepherd rocket development program as an important stepping-stone in establishing commercial human presence beyond our planet; however, the industry still has a long way to go before becoming mainstream travel option on par with airplanes or cruises today—if ever.

"Space tourism is going places but there's always room for improvement," said Dr. Mark Anderson - an astrophysicist and expert in commercial space flight at Caltech Space Institute (CalSci). "As technology advances, we hope to make these flights more accessible – maybe even routine trips with no prior training required."

Blue Origin plans on making several suborbital launches annually from CCAFS after refining their rocket design further. A ticket for just one-day private experience currently costs $250,000 and is expected to decrease over time as the company ramps up production capacity. There has been speculation about an additional seating option with more space aboard future variants of New Shepherd rockets – something Blue Origin CEO Bob Laxman hinted at during yesterday's press conference, saying: “We are always looking to innovate and find ways for as many people can share this incredible experience safely."
