A major storm system slamming through Florida has left a trail of destruction across numerous communities in Southwest and Central counties this weekend. Hundreds are without power as wind gusts exceeding 80 miles per hour uproot trees, damage buildings, cause landslides and flood streets with raging rivers. Emergency services say they received more than a thousand calls for help across the state during peak hours on Saturday afternoon alone.

Flooding in downtdestown St. Petersburg has cut off several neighborhoods from vital resources, as water levels rose rapidly after record-breaking downpours started early Sunday morning and continued throughout parts of the day with no signs of slowing down despite efforts to pump out excess waters through various dikes and retention basins set up in anticipation.

In an effort to help affected residents, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced a state disaster declaration on Saturday evening that will trigger additional aid for those struggling due to the natural calamity's aftermath across multiple counties including Pinellas County and Miami-Dade: "We are declaring this storm as an emergency which allows us access to federal funds right away without waiting any lengthy bureaucratic process," said Governor DeSantis during his briefing held at the Emergency Operations Center in Tampa.

Emergency services across multiple counties say that nearly every major thoroughfare has been either blocked by fallen trees or submerged under water while residents attempt to salvage their possessions, but fear losing them due to continuously rising floodwaters: "I'm worried about my family and our belongings in this house," says Mary Johnson of Plant City.

Palm Bay and Sebastian officials have opened evacuation centers for residents who need shelter after losing access to homes due to floodwaters or damaged roofs from fallen trees: "I appreciate the efforts of these shelters as we all try our best in times like this," says Susan White, a volunteer with First Coast Disaster Relief Group. She adds that they will continue working hard until everyone has been accounted for and safe wherever possible despite having no clear idea when normalcy can be expected back: "It's just heartbreaking to see what the storm did here in Florida," says 42-year-old Susan White as she helps remove debris from an evacuated home near Sebastian.

Residents and authorities alike say they hope this will serve only as a wakeup call for Floridians across all communities who have felt complacent about their own homes’ preparedness levels before now realizing how easy it is to become vulnerable when faced with natural disasters: "We need better infrastructure in Florida so that something like this
