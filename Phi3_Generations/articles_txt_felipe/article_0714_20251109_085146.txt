Jenny Thompson felt a mix of disbelief and joy when she landed her feet on French soil for perhaps the first time in over two decthyrs—her family had lived near Paris all along without knowing its significance as part of their lineage, thanks to newly unearthed documents. The historical findings revealed that Thompson's great-great-grandparents were among a wave of Irish immigrants who arrived in France during the mid-19th century seeking refuge from poverty and famine back home.

The discovery came as part of an ongoing genealogical research project led by Professor Jean Dupont, working closely with historians specializing in European migration patterns at the Sorbonne University based near Paris. For over a decade now, Thompson's lineage had been traced through records and DNA testing up to her parents, but nothing pointed beyond that generational marker until an obscure census record from 1854 fell into Professor Dupont’an eye during one of his extensive library visits at the national archives.

The handwritten document in question caught Thompson's interest when she chanced upon it while volunteering for a local museum as part of her college thesis on Irish immigration to Europe, work that had always felt too personal and close to home given its connection with French ancestry—something previously unbeknownst.

Professor Dupont later explained the significance: "This document is exceptionally rare; it's one-of-a-kind in this collection." He added, “It’s about rewriting history for many families who have been lost to time.” As such findings began unraveling personal narratives and broadened understandings of family histories interwoven with French cultural fabric.

Thompson's great-great grandfather had worked as a baker, while his wife supported them by selling home-baked goods on the streets—a humble life shared in common nowadays along busy Parisian boulevards and markets echoing stories from decades prior. A witness to their story is Madame Louise Boucher, who recalls seeing her great-great grandparents when she was a child: "They had such sad eyes; they looked like misfits in our tightly knit community."

As for the Thompsons' journey homeward on Thursday evening flight 432 from London to Paris, it’s not just their luggage that contains family heirlooms and souvenirs. The weighty documents—alongside birth certificates, marriage licenses, immigration papers dating back over a century—are sealed with wax signatures authenticated by forensic experts from the National Archives in Paris to prevent tampering or forgery doubting their validity and importance.

Thompson's great-great grandparents had been granted temporary residence permits as they adapted themselves into French society, a journey that was likely fraught with difficulty; however, her family has always taken pride in maintaining the Irish culture at home through music and language preservation efforts—a testament to their enduring connection.

The recent findings have sparked interest among other descendants of immigrant communities throughout Europe as they seek similar genealogical revelations into ancestral histories, according to Dupont: “I believe there’s a wealth of untold stories that could change how we perceive our own identities.”
