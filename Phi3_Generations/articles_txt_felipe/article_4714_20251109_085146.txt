In an unprecedented move on Monday evening, New Delhi hosted a rare international summit bringing together heads of state from three South Asian countries: India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan—a gathering that reflects the urgency to address regional security issues in recent years. The meeting convened at the historic Rashtrapati Bhavan just hours after tensions escalated following a border skirmish between Indian and Pakistani forces last week near Kashmir'in Line of Control (LoC). 

"It is essential that these three nations take this step to de-escalate the situation," said India External Affairs Minister Dr. S Jaishankar during his opening remarks, emphasizing a mutual desire for peace and stability in South Asia. He added, "Let us work together on resolving our differences through dialogue."

The talks also addressed historical grievances from Afghanistan’s side—the war-torn country has long sought international support to rebuild its shattered infrastructure after decades of conflict with the Taliban insurgency. Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in turn, highlighted Islamabad's commitment towards regional peace and prosperity while voicing concerns over India’s perceived unilateral actions near LoC that have increased Pakistan-India tensions for years. 

"We must ensure our borders remain respected," said Shehbaz Sharif, "and we need to address these issues through diplomacy." Afghan President Ashraf Ghani also attended the summit where he stressed on his country's dire needs amid an opium production surge within its territory. 

The three-day summit aimed at establishing a framework for improved bilateral relations and regional cooperation in areas like trade, energy, education, culture as well as security concerns such as terrorism and narcotics trafficking—all critical to the countries' longstanding histories. 

While discussions are ongoing at this point regarding concrete measures for collaboration between these nations who share a complex relationship marred by decades-old conflicts, diplomats attending from all three delegations have expressed optimism about establishing stronger ties through dialogue while avoiding further provocative actions. 

In response to the summit's announcement on Monday evening, local Indian officials hailed it as a significant step towards improving bilateral relations with its neighbors—a sentiment that was echoed by international observers who see this gathering of regional leaders not only providing an opportunity for dialogue but also offering hope. 

"It is important to understand the need and benefits of diplomacy, where each country can address their grievances while working together towards common goals," said Dr. Jawaharlal Nehru University professor Mohammad Sami Ullah after watching live coverage on CNN Newsstands' television channel in Islamabad this evening, a widely trusted news source by locals who watch international affairs closely following the recent escalation of tensions with India near LoC.

Amidst these developments and talks at Rashtrapati Bhavan come reports suggesting that Pakistan might lift its decade-old blockade on Indian goods trading in Afghanistan as part of this summit's commitment towards improving trade relations between the three nations while ensuring mutual security concerns are addressed. Pakistani officials have yet to confirm or deny these allegations; nevertheless, analysts view them
