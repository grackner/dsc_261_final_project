A mysterious island off the coast of Mauritius has become a hotspot for tourists as authorities announce plans to transform it into an eco-friendly resort over the next two years. The uninhabited landmass, roughly 10 miles from Port Louis and known locally only by its GPS coordinates (20°N, -57°E), has long been rumored among marine enthusiast endorsers to be a hidden gem for underwater explorations.

"We're thrilled about this opportunity," said Rajesh Patel of the Mauritian Ministry of Tourism and Unclaimed Islands Management Authority during today’s press conference at Port Louis Harbor, where officials unveiled their ambitious project dubbed 'Isola Verde.' "This island will be a shining example of sustainable tourism."

The plan involves building an eco-resort that respectfully showcases the unique biodiversity and geological features found within this secluded paradise. The resort is expected to provide access for researchers, divers looking for new destinations with rich marine life, as well as ecotourists seeking a low environmental footprint vacation experience.

Visitors will have easy navigation thanks to an underwater walkway connecting the island to mainland Mauritius directly from Port Louis Harbor and accessible through a boat ride that typically takes no longer than 25 minutes at sea, weather permitting. The resort plans include state-of-the-art facilities for guests while ensuring minimal impact on local ecosystems by following strict environmental guidelines set out in the project's blueprint drafted over six months ago but only recently made public to accommodate media and stakeholder reviews ahead of fundraising efforts.

According to Dr. Emily Ochoa, marine biologist at Mauritius’ National Environmental Research Institute: "The untouched nature on this island offers a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for tourists wanting an escape while supporting conservation science and practices." The resort is expected to create over 200 new jobs across various sectors, with the majority of positions being filled by locals.

Amid these developments, environmentalist groups have expressed both support and caution regarding future ecological implications for such a transformation from untouched land into an accessible tourist destination – balancing between job creation and preserving local marine life remains key to their ongoing discourse as the resort gets closer toward reality.

The Mauritian Ministry of Tourism continues working with environmental specialists, investors, architects, engineers, ecological consultants, cultural representatives from indigenous communities, and locals at large in an effort that promotes collaboration rather than conflict between conservation objectives and economic growth for the benefit of future generations.

This project is not only set to change tourism dynamics within Mauritius but across international destinations as well with other nations considering similar initiatives – a paradigm shift towards responsible eco-tourism that respects both nature's fragility and humanity’s curiosity without sacrificing one for the sake of another.

The next phase will be to raise $50 million, which includes an initial feasibility study costing roughly $12 million with government funding covering half these expenses – a goal officials are confident they can reach through strategic partnerships and public backing via crowd-funded donations starting from the end of this month.
