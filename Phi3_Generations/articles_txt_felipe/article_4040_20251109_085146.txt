Two brothers in New York City have been arrested for their role in a complex embezzlement scheme targeting elderly residents across four states since last year. The federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced today that Michael Thompson and David Thompson, both aged 32, had been taken into custody near Midtown Manhattan after months of undercover work led by Special Agent Sarah Miller unraveled the operation.

"These individuals exploited their positions within trusted senior care services to misappropriate funds meant for vulnerable citizens," said FBI Director Christopher Wray in a statement on Tuesday, as quoted by CNN New York bureau chief John Smithson. "Their arrest brings relief not only to the families affected but also serves as a reminder of our commitment to safeguarding those who need it most."

Investigators uncovered that Michael Thompson acted primarily in Washington D.C., while his younger brother David conducted operations from Florida, New Jersey, and California where several elderly individuals were defrauded out of their retirement savings totaling over $2 million between the states according to court documents obtained by DailyMail.com.

"I was shocked when I learned about what my brothers had been doing," said a tearful Michael Thompson during an interview with Special Agent Miller, who has since taken custody of him pending trial proceedings in December at United States District Court for the Southern District of New York where he is charged with federal offenses. "I wish they would have talked to me about their plans rather than hiding everything from everyone."

A spokesperson for Senior Care Services, a company that hired both brothers as financial coordinators before closing its operations in February 2021 after discovering discrepanmacies on several client accounts, told DailyMail.com: "The actions of the Thompson siblings are completely unacceptable and deeply regretted by us all."

Special Agent Miller emphasized that this case highlights an urgent need for increased vigilance in protecting senior citizens from financial scams nationwide during a conference call with reporters today. She added, "Education plays a huge role here – families must be informed about potential risks and encouraged to have open conversations so their loved ones know they can trust them."

Local authorities also took part in the crackdown on embezzlement activities targeting senior citizens with New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Singh highlighting, "We are committed to bringing these criminals responsible for exploiting our most vulnerable residents into justice system and ensuring such crimes do not continue." He urged families across NJ to monitor their loved ones' finances more closely.

The brothers face charges of conspiracy against the United States and wire fraud, each carrying a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison if convicted on all counts per federal indictment outlined by special prosecutor Michael Rodriguez today at Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance's office.

"It is not only about punishment but also providing justice for the families affected," said DA Vance as he addressed reporters accompanying him outside his downtown NYC headquarters, where both brothers will appear before a grand jury next week to decide on indictments that could lead them in federal custody.

Witnesses shared their harrowing experiences during the hearing and urged authorities for swift action against such crimes as one affected elderly woman recounted her ordeal of seeing
