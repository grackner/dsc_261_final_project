A powerful storm with wind speeds surpassing hurricane levels has made landfall in Miami-Dade County late Thursday evening local time, bringing extensive damage and widespsued power outages across the region according to reports from ABC News. The Category 4 weather system approached after a slow but steady build-up along Florida's east coast for several days before making contact with dry land near Miami International Airport around 10:30 PM Thursday, marking it as one of the most devastating storm systems to hit South Florida in recent years.

The National Weather Service issued a severe thunderstorm warning minutes prior and local meteorologists confirmed that wind gusts exceeded 125 miles per hour (mph) at times during its passage, causing unprecedented destruction throughout the city of Miami's sprawling urban landscape. According to initial reports from disaster response teams on-scene Thursday night near Little Haiti and Liberty City areas, numerous trees have fallen onto houses with broken windows visible in broad daylight amidst rushing wind currents that are capable of picking up debris miles away without warning—a testament to the sheer power behind this relentless force.

"It just looked like scenes straight from a disaster movie," remarked one witness, still shaken by what he saw when driving past his neighborhood shortly after sunset hours prior before authorities evacuated him due to mandatory orders stemming directly following earlier hurricane advisories given for several days leading up towards the storm's eventual arrival on shore. "I never thought I would experience something like this happening so close by, it feels surreal at times."

Experts emphasize that while these wind speeds are rare in an urban environment due to natural obstacles such as buildings and trees providing some level of barrier against storm-force airflows; they warn municipalities nationwide about the increasing frequency and intensity with which powerful weather events could occur given climate change forecasts suggesting more extreme temperatures leading up towards future hurricane seasons. Miami's mayor urged residents to take heed as city officials work round the clock assessing infrastructural damage that authorities predict will run into billions of dollars while prioritizing first responders, emergency services and hospitals in efforts aimed at getting power back on for hundreds of thousands who lost electricity amidst these harsh conditions.

"The resilience shown by our community during this tragedy is truly inspiring," said Mayor Daniella Levine Cava while addressing the media alongside Governor Ron DeSantis, FEMA director David Paul and local disaster response teams as they conducted aerial surveys via helicopter early Friday morning to assist ground operations amid continued downpours expected from an approaching cold front. "We will rebuild stronger together for a brighter future despite this immense challenge."
