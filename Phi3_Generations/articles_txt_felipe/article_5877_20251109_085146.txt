A mysterious fire broke out at a historical inn in Old Town Alexandria, Virginia on March 15th morning with officials saying it remains unexplained to this day despite an extensive investigation by local authorities and the FBI National Fire Prevention Association (NIPFA). The Inn of Time opened its doors just over two months ago after being closed for restoration following a devastating fire in June last year. Now, almost as if haunted by fate itself, flames once again engulfed this landmark building at around 6:30 AM EST while the inn was empty and completely staffless due to COVID-19 restrictions.

The Old Town Fire Department responded quickly but found their efforts hampered when an uncooperative sprinkler system failed, reportedly because of maintenance neglect during its closure for renovations last year before being forced shut by pandemic lockdowns in March 2curing the fire's spread. "We have never seen anything like this," stated Captain Mark Johnson with local emergency services when describing how quickly and unexpectedly flames grew, leaving behind significant structural damage to original features that had taken so much time restoring after last year’s blaze—which authorities say started in the basement of a separate building next door.

In light of this tragedy experts warn such fires can become deadly given how quickly they spread; especially with homes containing flammable materials like insulation and old appliances often contributing to rapid growth due to potential chemical reactions under intense heat conditions—making preventative measures vital as temperatures rise across the country over summer months when dry winds blow from nearby states carrying wildfire risks.

Local resident Jane Doe, who had visited just days prior for a brief stay but now resides only blocks away with her family and beloved dog Bruno since she felt safer keeping close during these challenging times - added that seeing all this destruction saddened everyone in the tight-knit community: "This is such an iconic part of our town; it’s hard to see something like this happen again," Doe lamented while taking a walk with Bruno along Old Town's usually busy thoroughfare now silent except for sirens wailing down ahead and occasional loud crackling noise echoing through the surrounding buildings which have been evacuated due to safety concerns.

The Inn of Time, owned by Alexander Graham Bell Inc., was constructed in 1870 as a working-class boarder's house that changed hands several times until acquired nearly one hundred years later when Mr. Bell decided its historic significance warranted preservation—an expensive endeavor requiring constant upkeep and renovation work funded solely by him without any governmental aid since he believed these efforts would also bring tourism dollars back to this quaint community along Alexandria's picturesque waterfront area, which sits less than a mile away from historic monuments like The Spy Museum.

Mrs. Bell said her late husband spent his later years researching the building’s past and even wrote several articles on its history—but now he lies silent inside as they fight to save whatever salvageable materials remain before water damage sets in due their basement being underwater after firefighters pumped out all floodwaters by using large-capacity tankers arriving quickly at the scene with hoses and nozzles specially designed for these purposes.

"I never thought I’d see this again," Mr Bell added when discussing how close he feels
