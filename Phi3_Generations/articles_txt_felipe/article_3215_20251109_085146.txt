In a surprising turn of events on Friday afternoon in New York City's financial district, local businesses faced unprecedent disruption as protesters gathered outside Wall Street Bank & Trust demanding account transparency and improved customer service practices during the bank’s annual shareholder meeting. Over two thousand individuals were seen marching to various banks across Times Square for similar reasons over a three-hour period, leading community leaders to call it one of the largest coordinated actions against local financial institutions in decades.

The protest started outside Wall Street Bank & Trust when several activists and concerned customers began holding signs that read "We deserve honesty" as early afternoon turned into evening hours on August 12th, just before thousands were expected to tune into the bank's shareholder meeting via live streaming from their headquarters at One Broadway Place.

A spokesperson for Wall Street Bank & Trust responded quickly after being approached by a representative of Citizen Watchdogs United (CWU), an organization formed last month in response to growing community concerns about local banks’ transparency and customer service issues: "We understand the frustration, but we are working on it. As for today's protesters—let me tell you what they can do instead."

Protest coordinator Alex Mercer addressed gathered individuals with firm tone saying; “This movement demands changes that would make our community stronger and better equipped to face challenges in the future.” He added, "Our voices must be heard. The banks cannot ignore us any longer!" Some business owners around Times Square expressed worry over how these disturbances might affect local commerce while others saw it as an opportunity for dialogue with bank officials they hadn't had before: “I hope this brings about positive changes,” said restaurant owner Samantha Green, a supporter of the protests. She told CNN Money she will continue serving meals despite ongoing disruptions but hopes banks "begin listening and act."

The Wall Street Bank & Trust is scheduled to address customer service issues at its annual shareholder meeting tonight (August 12th). The bank has already announced it’s forming an internal committee with representatives from various stakeholders including customers, business owners in Times Square, regulators and community leaders.

Meanwhile local authorities are working closely with organizers to ensure the protest remains peaceful while also addressing concerns raised by some shopkeepers who claim they're suffering due to disruptions caused last Friday afternoon as well during holiday shopping season: “This kind of behavior is not acceptable,” Police Chief Robert Taylor said. "We are doing everything we can on our end and will continue taking necessary steps."

Representatives from various community groups attending this weekend’s protest were hopeful about the potential for long-term improvements, but agreed they needed to find ways that allowed them their grievances heard without causing disruptions around high traffic areas. “We must not forget our neighbors who may just be trying businesses here in Times Square,” said CWU representative James Peterson. "This issue is bigger than one bank or a few individuals."

As the crowd dispersed, many expressed determination that their voices were heard and change could happen soon enough to make New York City's financial hub run more efficiently for everyone involved: “I’m here today because I believe in my community,” said protester Lisa Nguyen. "We have been ignored long enough."
