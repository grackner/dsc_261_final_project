Miami Dolphins' Quarterback Tom Brady Takes on Miami University in Mid-Season Challenge for Charity; Goal to Raise $50K within Month

December 14, 2023 - When you think of soccer stars taking part in charitable events outside the traditional competitive arena, it's not often that one name comes up: Tom Brady. Yet this two-time Super Bowl champion has found himself playing a midseason match at Miami University on Friday evening as an ambassador for 'Ducks4Life,' a nonprosemaritime charity aimed at improving mental health support in college towns across the United States.

The event, hosted by Brady alongside fellow former NFL stars Eric Dickerson and Warren Moon, will see fans flock to Ohio's historic Wattison Field for an exhibition match between Miami University's varsity soccer team (the Ducks) and a group of invited experts from the National Football League. The game is expected to draw in upwards of 10,000 supporters over its duration as word spread across social media platforms about this unusual gathering that marries sports with community engagement efforts.

"I've never played soccer at Miami University before today," Brady confessed during a pregame interview broadcasted live on national TV channels alongside coverage of the main event, "but it gives me great pleasure to support such an important cause." The charity focuses specifically on young adults facing mental health challenges and strives for more accessible resources in collegiate settings.

The match itself will kick off at 4 pm ET with Brady's team leading by just a single goal against the NFL veterans, who have been invited due to their experience handling high-pressure situations on sizable fields such as Wattison Field where professional cameras and live audiences can amplify stress levels. Audience members not directly involved in playing are free to purchase tickets at concession stands near the field entrance with proceeds benefiting 'Ducks4Life.'

"Sportsmanship isn't just about winning or losing; it also includes coming together as a community and making an impact on societal issues," said Miami University Athletic Director, John Davis. "Today is another fantastic opportunity for our players to engage with fans beyond the game itself."

Brady plans to stay in touch with 'Ducks4Life' after the event concludes by providing additional funding from his end and encouraging more college athletes across all sports disciplines to get involved locally. This unique collaboration between a retired football player, soccer enthusiast Brady who is currently serving as Miami University head coach of Men’s Soccer for this one season only, has already garnered attention nationwide since announcements began circulating last month through traditional media channels and social platforms alike.

"We are honored to have Tom here today representing 'Ducks4Life' alongside his fellow NFL veterans," shared Davis during yesterday’s press conference with reporters covering this event for national newspapers such as the New York Times, ESPN etc., "I hope our players can learn from them about making positive changes through their influence off-field too."

Miami University will continue to promote 'Ducks4Life' in subsequent years by hosting further events on campus including football game openers, homecoming celebrations and spirit days that also raise awareness for this cause.
