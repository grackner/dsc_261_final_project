Former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo was arrested Monday on charges of tax evasion and bank fraud in Texas related to an undisclosed sports-related income stream he allegedly failed to report over the past five years, according to sources close to the investigation. The arrest came as a shock within Pro Football circles, given that Mr. Romo played for one of America's most beloved franchises and is widely regarded in football punditry trivia contests across the country. Authorities claim he intentionally avoided reporting earnings from endorsement deals during his retirement years after leaving Dallas to seek a career on Fox’носий NFL team, which was not immediately disclosed by authorities citing an ongoing investigation into unrelated matters in Dallas that has put him under intense scrutiny. A source close to the probe shared details about Romo's lifestyle and expenses during this period with CNN. "I can say without question there were some extravagances tied to his football career," said the person, who asked not to be named due to fear of retaliation by powerful figures in Cowboys Nation. "But most people don’t realize that Tony Romo was making $150,000 a year less than he did when he played for Dallas during these years while still living his lavish life." The source further detailed the extent to which some of Romo's personal expenses were inflated due to claims made in support. "I’ve reviewed at least five different pieces of paperwork that claim extravagant payments, but only $20 million was ever paid out," he said referring to documentation associated with endorsements and sponsorship deals Romo allegedly failed to report as income on his tax returns during the years after leaving Dallas.

Romo’s spokesperson confirmed the allegations and expressed regret for not reporting additional income on tax returns, according to sources familiar with Romo's earnings since leaving Dallas: “It has come out about Tony now because we have been asked questions by investigators in that case." He said Mr. Romo regrets any mistakes made but was unaware of the specific allegations until press reports circulated yesterday, CNN reported Sunday night based on conversations with sources within Pro Football circles and law enforcement agencies involved in Dallas-related matters to which he is tied. Tony Romo's wife Melissa confirmed her husband has been cooperating fully with authorities since becoming aware of the allegations: “The last two weeks have really taken a turn for us, but I’m grateful that my family and friends stand behind me.” She declined to comment further on details surrounding the case. Authorities say Romo could face multiple years in prison if found guilty of tax evasion alone due to non-disclosure of income from endorsement deals after leaving Dallas for Fox, according to prosecutors familiar with the investigation that has taken a sudden turn and is still unfolding as details continue to emerge. This latest development comes shortly before Romo was expected to embark on his first charity golf tournament aimed at raising millions of dollars annually in support of families impacted by cancer, which would have been held last month if the
