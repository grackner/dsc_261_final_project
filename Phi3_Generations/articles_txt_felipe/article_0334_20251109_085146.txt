In a stunning turn of events at Super Bowl LIV on February 13th in Miami Gardens, Florida, quarterback Tom Brady threw two interceptions leading to touchdown catches by opposing players Colby Harris and Elijah Taylor within the first ten minutes. The New England Patriots are now facing an uphill battle against their AFC divisional opponents as this unexpected loss throws into question a title contention that had seemed increasingly promising prior to kickoff.

The 36-year-curmudgeon, Tom Brady led the hometown New England Patriots with his usual prowess until he faltered early on against seasoned defensive players from Cincinnati Bengals and threw two interceptions within a matter of minutes in front of millions.
“This is unacceptable,” said coach Bill Belichick, visibly frustrated as the Patriots trailed 7-0 midway through halftime break after Brady’s mistake led to an easy touchdown by Harris for Bengals who have been on fire since day one of their season.
“Brady is supposed to be our best player and we need him at his peak during these crucial matches, but he isn't showing the form I expected from a veteran like Brady.”  
Harris’ touchdown came in less than three minutes into Super Bowl LIV game as Patriots were taking aim on Cincinnati. Harris snagged an easy 20-yard catch and sprinted towards Bengals' end zone, scoring the first points for his team at home by way of a pick six from Brady’s interception
Elijah Taylor quickly capitalized on another early mistake made within three minutes into halftime as he snatches an easy 30-yard catch that led to touchdown after Patriots faltered in their passing game.
The New England team had managed a mere nine points at the end of first half, while Bengals’ were leading with twenty against Brady's best efforts and his backup Jarrett Stutz who was on full display as he attempted an even more ambitious plan to recover from this loss in hopes of turning their season around.
"I know we made mistakes early that led us into a hole, but I believe our defense can make up for it with some good plays." Assistant Coach Sam Hunt shared his confidence after the Patriots' offensive struggles during halftime discussions while Bengals looked to capitalize on this loss.
In an unusual turn of events as Brady returned from injury, he was sidelined once again but only for a matter of minutes before quarterback Jarrett Stutz filled in where needed most which left the Patriots fans disappointed and bewildered by his performance so far that hasn't shown any promising signs.
The Bengals are on top with twelve points after their third touchdown while Brady managed to lead for less than a minute before being replaced as he continues rehabilitation protocols set forth prior season injuries, leaving fans and Patriots supporters concerned about his return date at this point in time along side questions surrounding the team's future.
With Cincinnati up 12-9 by halftime break, New England’s offensive woes had put a damper on their hopes of taking home another ring with Brady stepping back out to play but failed once again as Stutz struggled under immense pressure leading to an interception within minutes.
