In a major push to address stress and anxiety in schools across New York City this fall semester, Mayor Bill de Blasio has partnered with mindfulness experts to bring meditation training sessions into classrooms throughout the five boroughs. The initiative began as of September 1st after concerns about rising mental health issues among students grew louder in recent months and have since drawn interest from parents, educators, and child psychologists alike.

Mayor Bill de Blasio expressed that "it's essential to equip our children with tools for emotional resilience," as the program aims not just at relaxation but also on fostering better communication skills among students in one of America’selocal centers of mindfulness education is expected to include public high schools, charter institutions and community-based youth organizations.

The first Mindful Learning Day was held this weekend with over 50 meditation sessions organized simultaneously at various locations throughout the city as a demonstration run for educators participating in the program's training phase that lasted from August to early September, said one of Mayor de Blasio’s chief education advisors who asked not to be named.

The New York Times reports that school districts will pay $30 per student annually for each mindfulness class offered — with most schools opting to dedicate at least two classes a week during lunch and after-school hours in addition to providing resources for students' families, according the Department of Education. The department expects about 15% or more than 2 million eligible NYC public school children will participate throughout this year alone based on attendance records from previous years as well.

At P.S. 168 in Harlem yesterday afternoon during its first Mindful Learning Day, students and parents sat quietly with their backs straight as they learned the basics of mindfulness meditation guided by an instructor hired directly through Mayor de Blasio's office for just under $30 per hour. One student shared his thoughts on how he felt after participating in a session, "I liked it because I feel calm and relaxed."

Experts believe mindfulness can be particularly beneficial to young people dealing with anxiety or depression as well as those who find themselves feeling isolated due to the pandemic's impact. Dr. Michael Aamodt—a clinical psychologist working in a NYC community mental health center and part of Mayor Bill de Blasio’s Mindfulness Task Force — said mindful practices encourage kids "to develop more self-awareness," helping them identify their feelings, emotions, bodily sensations as well. 

He pointed out that some children may feel uncomfortable talking about what they experience inside or with peers and family members but added: “We found mindfulness practices are helpful for kids to express themselves in other ways like through drawing."

However, not everyone is convinced of the program’s benefits. Parent Sarah Connor expressed her skepticism at P.S. 168 during a Mindful Learning Day as she sat with her daughter Amanda while practicing mindfulness meditation exer012345_nounsg

“It's not something I see working for my child," said Connor, who has tried other mental health support methods in the past. "They seem to get more agitated than anything when trying new techniques." A school official at P.S.
