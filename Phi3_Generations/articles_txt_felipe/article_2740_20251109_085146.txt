In an unprecedented event that'seluded holidaymakers across Europe, a rare albino Bengal tiger was spotted last Thursday in the heart of Berlin during Oktoberfest celebrations by hundreds enjoying their festive meals and drinks. The sighting took place near Alexanderplatz at around 3 p.m., leaving both locals and tourists stunned as they witnessed a creature usually associated with jungles amidst urban revelry instead of the traditional beer-soaked Oktoberfest festivities in Germany's vibrant capital city, according to eyewitness reports filed by CNN.

"I saw this massive tiger emerge from nowhere right at lunchtime," said Emily Smithson, a tourist visiting Berlin for the first time who was among those taken aback when she spotted the animal crossing her path near Kottbusser Tor square. "It wasn't dressed up or anything; just this incredibly beautiful creature walking amongst us."

A source within Germany’s National Tiger Conservation Organization confirmed to DailyMail they have received numerous reports of sightings similar in nature across several European countries over the past few weeks and were working closely with local authorities on containment efforts. "These animals, which are supposed to reside thousands of miles away from urban areas such as Berlin, seem disoriented," said a spokesperson for the organization who requested anonymity due to safety concerns regarding public exposure of information about these potentially dangerous creatures in their native habitats outside Africa.

Efforts are being made by wildlife experts and animal control teams across Europe - including Germany, France, Austria, Italy – with more than a dozen sightings reported from each country since early July as authorities attempt to locate the source of these seemingly wayward animals that have exhibited no signs of aggression towards humans or domestic pets in any of the reports received so far.

Berlin's Mayor Franziska Giffey, who has been actively following developments and statements from local wildlife experts since news first broke out about sightings elsewhere across Europe some weeks ago - but with nothing confirmed until recently regarding their presence here on German soil – commented today during a press conference held at the Brandenburg Gate. "While we are not entirely sure how these animals ended up in Berlin, our priority is always to ensure public safety above all else," she said as images of what many locals and tourists described having seen were projected behind her for emphasis on screen - showing nothing more than an astonishing black-and-white tiger wandering through the streets. "We will continue working together with experts from our National Tiger Conservation Organization, local authorities across Europe as well as other relevant partners to locate and safely contain these animals."

Authorities have been urged by citizens not only within Germany but beyond its borders in countries like France or Italy – where sightings of similar-sized feline creatures roaming freely through streets are also on record - such expressions can be interpreted more as outrage over the disruption than a genuine fear for personal safety.

"We understand people's frustration, but let’s not forget that these animals do deserve protection too," stated Professor Hans Müller from Berlin’s renowned University of Zoology and Natural History who has been closely following reports about sightings outside Africa in recent months now making headlines here within Europe. "If they truly need relocation assistance to find their way back home, I hope our government can
