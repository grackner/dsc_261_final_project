In a stunning turn of events yesterday at Wanda Metropolitano Stadium in Madrid on March 3rd, Chelsea FC's Cristiano Ronaldo delivered an outstanding performance that left the league fans and critics alike marveling as he scored four goals against Real Madrid CF. With this triumphant showcase by one of Europe’ enduring soccer legends, his team soared to a 6-3 victory in the highly anticipated UEFA Champions League semi-final first leg match with their arch-rivals from La Liga's reigning champions and two-time world title winners.

In an interview following the game, Ronaldo spoke about what inspired him on that memorable night: "I knew tonight was important not just for me but also for my teammates who have worked so hard to get here," he said with a beaming smile. With goals at minute 23 and again in extra time after an injury stoppage, Ronaldo's dominance on the field led Chelsea FC into this historic game where they are set against Real Madrid CF tomorrow night for legs two of their semi-final clash that promises to be one not soon forgotten.

The atmosphere at Wanda Metropolitano Stadium was electric as thousands cheered and chanted in support before kickoff with anticipation reaching a fever pitch, but the energy did nothing more than amplify Chelsea's already resounding victory over Real Madrid CF this evening -- thanks to Ronaldo. As he lifted his trophy high above both teams on that bright afternoon at Wanda Metropolitano Stadium in Spain last March 3rd, eyes were locked onto Cristiano as the hero of not only tonight’s game but also an inspiring reminder for anyone seeking victory against all odds: “It was a privilege to play with such supportive fans and my teammates,” he said after his fourth goal.

This historic night saw Chelsea FC rise from 15th place in the English Premier League at season's end, just outside European qualification into contention for their first UEFA Champions League semi-final since 2008 when they faced Arsenal Fc (in which Cristiano scored only two goals and ended up not playing due to injury). As this once seemingly impossible dream continues unraveling before our very eyes, let's hope we get another memorable spectacle tomorrow night as these rivals go head-to-head in the battle for soccer supremacy. 

In reactions across social media since yesterday’s stunning result where Chelsea FC emerged victorious over Real Madrid CF with a scoreline of 6:3, Cristiano Ronaldo has been hailed as "The new legend," according to one fan tweeting an emotional account. The sentiment was echoed by the club's CEO who praised him saying in an interview on Wednesday that he is “a symbol not only for Chelsea but also across all of Europe and inspiration for everyone around us.” 

With eyes set firmly upon tomorrow night at Wanda Metropolitano Stadium, La Liga’s most-attended stadium (capacity: 81,305), soccer fans worldwide eager to witness this legendary semi-final encounter cannot help but feel that history is being made.
