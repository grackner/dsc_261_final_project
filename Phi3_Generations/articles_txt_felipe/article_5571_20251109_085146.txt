A major earthquake struck near Cape Town in South Africa early Wednesday morning, causing widespCT damage and leaving thousands of people without power or shelter. According to local authorities, the quake registered a magnitude of 6.3 on the Richter scale at around 4:02 am (Cape Time) with its epicenter just offshore in Table Bay near False Bay.

Witnesses described terrifying scenes as they felt intense shaking that lasted for about two minutes, reports CNN Africa Bureau Chief Sam Kroonveld and reporter Lara Cullis-Suzuki based on eyewitness accounts collected via our correspondents in Cape Town. "I was sitting at my desk when the ground started to rumble underneath me," said local business owner, Sipho Nkoyisa from Durban Waterfront Mall near Rosebank.

The tremors were felt as far away as Johannesburg and Port Elizabeth – more than 300 kilometers (186 miles) from the epicenter at Cape Point Peninsula where tourists flocked to enjoy sunny days off their holidays, says South African Geological Survey. "I was on my morning walk when I felt it first," said Janet van Heerden as she looked out over Table Mountain and Robben Island from Lion’s Head – a popular viewing spot in Cape Town's Victoria & Alfred Waterfront where tourists typically gather for an iconic sunset shot.

Initial reports estimate that roughly 80,000 residents across the Western Cape are without power while at least four major hospitals remain shut down because of generator failure due to frequent rolling blackouts imposed on South Africa since late last year as a result of chronic energy shortages and increasing demand. Residents have reported seeing cracks in walls and found broken windows inside their homes, says emergency response coordinator, Thandi Modise from the city’s disaster management department: "We are assessing every building for safety hazards but there is no immediate threat of collapse at this stage."

According to local experts like seismologist Dr. Naledi Mtshali from University of Cape Town, a 6-point earthquake can cause damage and shaking that lasts minutes or even longer depending on depth and distance beneath the ground's surface: "This region is prone to experiencing moderate magnitude quakes as it sits near two major plate boundaries – African Plate meeting South American Plate at East coast of Africa, plus Atlantic Ridge along West Coast. However, such intense shaking rarely happens here."

Official statements came from the National Disaster Management Agency's emergency response team stating that search and rescue efforts would begin immediately while evacuation plans are being made for nearby hotels in high-risk areas: "We urge residents to stay calm, follow our safety protocol closely until further notice," said spokesperson Lindiwe Ntshele. Meanwhile officials from the South African National Roads Agency confirmed that major routes like M1 (Durban-Cape Town Highway), R307 (Rosebank Bypass) and Kloof Road remain closed for inspection while crews work around the clock to clear debris, repair infrastructure damage caused by tremors.

The local Meteorological Department reported that similar quakes struck in 1945, but not nearly as strong or widespread – only about a
