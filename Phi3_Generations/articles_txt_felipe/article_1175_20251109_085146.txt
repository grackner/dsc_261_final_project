Pittsburgh Steelers' star receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster has been charged with DUI in connection to a bar incident last Saturday night near Heinz Field where he attended an away game at Baltimore Ravens, according to official reports this morning. The arrest occurred shortly after the final whistle as witnesses claim they saw him stumbling out of East Side Station, leading officers to conduct field sobriety tests which resulted in a positive indication for intoxication.

The 24-year-injury charge comes on the heels of Smith-Schuster's stellar season with Pittsburgh where he led the team in receiving yards and caught more passes than any other player at his position during this year’s postseason, according to Steelers Head Coach Mike Tomlin. 

"Juju has always been one of our most reliable receivers on offense," said Smith-Schuster who hails from nearby Latrobe and was a first round pick by the Steelers in 2017’s NFL Draft, "but we expected better behavior tonight. This incident will reflect poorly not just upon him but also our entire organization."

Smith-Schuster's legal team is yet to respond publicly; however, his agent informed that Smith was cooperative throughout the process and has since regretted his actions as he realizes it could jeopardize both their professional and personal lives. The Ravens have also issued a statement saying they wish him all well but will continue with appropriate consequences for such behavior in accordance to league policies, which are designed not only to maintain player safety on the field but off-the-field as well.

The NFL Players Association released this joint statement: "As always we stand ready to support our players’ physical and mental health; however, when it comes at expense of public peace or personal relationships, they cannot expect leniency from league policies." The Steelers are expected take Smith-Schuster off the team roster permanently if his upcoming court hearing in early December doesn't result in a lesser charge. 

Pittsburgh and Baltimore played an annual Thanksgiving Day game with much fanfare, including tailgating parties at both stadiums where thousands of Steelers fans came together to watch the pre-game festivities before heading over for their respective home games on Sunday afternoon. This year's attendance was recorded as 60,000 spectators in each city and while there were no signs of disturbances this seasoned rivalry remained friendly with both teams sharing a positive camaraderie amidst the heated competition throughout the game day events leading up to kickoff.

Smith-Schuster's arrest has caused an immediate backlash among Steelers fans, many expressing dismay and disappointment on social media as they mourn their favorite player’s downfall. While NFL commissioner Roger Goodell issued a statement saying he is “disappointed” by the news of Smith-Schuster's actions but remains hopeful for his rehabilitation and return to football in future, local law enforcement authorities say that they will not hesitate taking further action if needed. The incident served as a reminder from all sides about maintaining discipline off on field behavior aligning with the league’s focus towards player safety at all times – both within games themselves but also outside once players and fans alike have had enough of such actions ruining precious time spent together celebrating their shared love for
