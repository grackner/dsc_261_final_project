In an astonishing turn of events this past weekend at Wembley Stadium in London on March 15th, England's underdog team stunned France with a narrow victory of just two goals to one during the final matchday group stage of Euro 2dis. The win sent jubilation through both camps and provided much-needed hope for the squad that will enter their quarterfinal showdown next weekend without prior playoff experience against Belgium, who won comfortably in last year's tournament semifinal.

England manager Gareth Southgate praised his team: "It has been a tough journey and we gave everything on our feet this time," he said after the match ended 2-1 with goals by Adam Philips in both halves, while France coach Didier Deschamps acknowledged defeat saying there was room for improvement.

This unexpected victory comes at an exciting moment as England now boasts a winless streak of only three matches overall on European soil after previous disappointing results against Netherlands and Germany earlier this year; however, the underdog spirit seems to be back alive within their team following these recent triumphs with encouragement from national supporters.

According to head coach Gareth Southgate who remarked during post-match interviews: "Our young players deserve credit for keeping composure throughout such an intense match, showing resilience even when faced with strong opposition." Meanwhile, France's veteran midfielder Kamil Grosicki highlighted the need to work harder on defense in future games saying that he was concerned about their recent struggles.

The unexpected win has already been hailed as England’s 'comeback of seasons past', igniting hope for fans and team members alike after a series of unfortunate results against some top European teams earlier this year; with Southgate's innovative tactics bringing out the best in young players, it seems there might be light at end days.

England will now prepare to face Belgium next weekend where they aim for victory that could potentially set them up on a path towards reaching their goal of qualifying from this tournament which starts again after Saturday's action against Croatia; while critics still harbor skepticism about England’s chances, supporters remain optimistic despite not having played at Euro 2016 level before.

In the past few days leading up to Sunday's matchup with Belgium, there has been an influx of fans flooding stadiums across Europe cheering for their team; though some analysts believe England must still significantly improve on defensive solidarity according to soccer expert Tom Smith who commented that they "must learn how not just win but control matches too."

As the excitement continues, with only days until kickoff against Belgium next weekend at Wembley Stadium; fans eagerly await if more surprises lie ahead as England takes on what could be seen by some as a do-or-die situation for them. With this unexpected victory already serving to boost team morale and spirit amongst players while sparking national pride across the country, all eyes will now turn towards their upcoming challenge against Belgium which promises great potential should they manage another upset win like before; with hopes high among England fans that perhaps history may repeat itself as we head into Sunday's showdown.
