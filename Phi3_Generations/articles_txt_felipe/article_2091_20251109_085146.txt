In an iconic move to revamp city aesthetics and encourage sustainable living, New York City has unveiled its latest urban design project in Manhattan's Hudson Yards district last Thursday (September 15th). The initiative introduces eco-friendly modular apartments designed by renowned architect Mariana Waugh that are both affordable and stylish, addressing the city’ extrinsic housing crisis.

The groundbreaking ceremony was attended by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio who remarked in his speech: "This is not just about providing shelter but also designing living spaces for our people to feel at home." Alongside him were state and local government representatives, real estate developers, environmental experts, and community members.

The Mariana Waugh project has been a long-time dream of hers since she witnessed the stark contrast between skyscrapers in New York City's skyline during her European travels at age 17 – where opulence meets affordability rarely seen elsewhere globally, as per Ms. Waugh: "I always felt that it was possible to meld functionality with stylish design."

The concept involves a series of stackable modular homes which can be configured according to the family size and income level. The materials used are largely recyclable or upcycled, minimizing environmental impact while maintaining visual appeal – blending in seamlessly into New York City's diverse neighborhood profile that ranges from high-end luxury penthouses to humble brownstones on every block.

CNN Cities Reporter Michael Clarkson observed during the site visit: "Its sleek and modern exterior doesn't just look good but feels like a breath of fresh air in this concrete jungle." As per Waugh, these homes not only reduce construction waste by up to 50%, they also contribute to lower heating costs due to passive solar design features.

With an estimated completion date within the next two years and funded through public-private partnerships, Mayor de Blasio hopes this project will set a precedent for future developments across NYC's boroughs – marrying style with purpose in ways never seen before on American soil: "Through thoughtful design that respects both people’s needs and the planet, we can create livable spaces where everyone has access to quality housing."

As New Yorkers anticipate this bold transformation of their beloved city's skyline – one affordable home at a time - environmental designer Elena Gomez comments: "There is an incredible opportunity here for us as designers and urban planners; it’s like opening Pandora's box on sustainable living spaces without sacrificing individuality or style."
