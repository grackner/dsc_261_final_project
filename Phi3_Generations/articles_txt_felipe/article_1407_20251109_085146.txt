A devastating earthquake struck Japan early Tuesday morning with a preliminary magnitude of 7.8 on the Richter scale near Fukushima Prefecture; thousands are feared trapped under debris as rescuers continue to work tirelessly amidst aftershocks and potential radiation concerns from damaged nuclear reactors at the facility which date back decades before current events, according to a report by CNN.


Authorities in Tokyo say over 10,00thousand people have been displaced with tens of thousands left without power or access as search-and-rescue teams face increasingly dangerous conditions; officials are appealing for calm and patience among the survivors who had planned picnics but instead faced harrowing experiences when panic ensued shortly after tremors were felt, stated Hideki Nakazato, a local government official.


An emergency response coordinator from Tokyo highlighted that "the situation is rapidly evolving and we are constantly assessing the safety of our responders as they work through collapsed buildings," adding his team has not yet found survivors in several affected areas but continue their efforts under challenging circumstances, reported Yoshihito Suzuki for Kyodo News.


As rescue operations extend into multiple days due to aftershocks causing new damage and the need to be cautious about radioactive materials released from a nuclear plant that is still on standby since its last significant incident in 2011, local citizens express their resilience through acts of kindness as families take turns sleeping at temporary shelters near disaster sites.


"We're all feeling scared and vulnerable, but we have to stay strong for each other," shared Haruka Tanaka with tears in her eyes during an interview on Japanese public radio; she recounted spending hours searching through the rubble of what used to be a small coffee shop near Tokyo before being taken away by rescue services.


The international community is showing solidarity as global aid pours into Japan, but experts caution about potential secondary hazards such as waterborne diseases spreading due to contaminated rivers flooded with debris and chemical waste; Dr. Emily Park from the World Health Organization warns that "it is vital for all stakeholders in this disaster response effort to monitor health conditions closely, particularly among displaced individuals who may be at heightened risk," emphasizing preventative measures during her statement broadcast live on CNN International.


With thousands still unaccounted for and the full extent of damage yet unknown as aftershocks continue to jolt communities throughout Japan's northeast region since the first quake hit early Tuesday, relief organizations plan long-term strategies in collaboration with local authorities aiming at sustainable rebuilding efforts that also include strengthening infrastructure against future earthquakes and reinforcing safety protocols around nuclear facilities.
