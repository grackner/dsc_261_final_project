A powerful typhoon made landfall in southern Japan early this morning as it tore through coastal areas with wind speeds of up to 120 kilometers per hour, the Meteorological Agency reported. The storm was expected to continue moving westward before dissipating over water near Kyushu island late today.

In a statement released earlier today by officials from Kagoshima prefecture, where severe damage has been caused in coastal areas such as Minamisatsuma and Miminatoyama towns, they warned of significant impacts on the region's infrastructure and residents’ safety due to windstorm surge.

Severe flooding was reported by local news outlets throughout Kagoshima prefecture today after heavy rains inundated rivers and low-lying areas across southern Kyushu island ahead of Typhoon Noa, as it is now being called locally. "We're dealing with the double impacts from relentless rain on top of an already devastating storm surge," said Kagoshima Governor Takahiro Yamanouchi in a morning interview broadcasted to Japanese citizens nationwide today via public TV and radio stations, according to Kyushu News.

Typhoon Noa is currently located about 250 kilometers south of Sapporo on Hokkaido island with the center still near shore but has begun moving westward towards northern Japan amid a warm sea surface temperature that's expected to fuel its intensity in coming days before it makes landfall along western Japanese coast again, meteorologists have warned.

Local authorities are preparing for what could be another week of flooding and storm-related damages after the first round caused by Typhoon Noa last month led to at least 20 deaths in Japan as well as millions of dollars worth of damage across southern Kyushu island alone, according to reports. "We're still not entirely sure about exact details but initial assessments from our teams on ground and aerial surveys indicate that wind speeds near shore reached their peak today with a maximum sustained speed up to 120 kilometers per hour," explained Hiroshi Yamada, chief meteorologist for the Japan Meteorological Agency'in Tokyo this afternoon.

"This is definitely one of our strongest typhoons so far in terms of intensity and potential impacts on affected areas." Local citizens are advised to stay indoors if wind speeds reach their peak today as heavy downpours continue through the night, forecasters have warned. "We urge people who cannot seek shelter immediately due to various reasons such as mobility constraints or work-related commitments in coastal areas at risk from Typhoon Noa's storm surges and landfall," a Kyushu Tourism Promotion Organization official said, noting the importance of staying safe before it is too late.

Several shelters have opened throughout southern Kyushu island for people to find temporary refuge as officials continue assessments on ground following reports that some roads are impassable due to flooding and fallen trees while rail services remain disrupted in major cities like Kagoshima, Sapporo, Miyazaki and Fukuoka. "We're currently conducting a full-scale survey of infrastructure damages but have already observed several collapsed road sections as well as power lines downed by strong winds," said an official from the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transportation and Tourism in
