Dead Sea Scroll fragments believed to date back over two millennia were recently discovered by an Israeli Bedouin boy in a cave near his home north of Jerusalem, according to Haaretz and Times of Israel reports on March 15th, 2023. The young nomad stumbled upon the ancient artifacts while searching for date palm seeds inside Qumran Cave I, located about half an hour northeast from Hebron in the northern West Bank region administered by Israeli authorities as part of Area C under military control since 1967.

"The boy found fragments that we believe are some of the most significant ancient artifacts ever unearthed," said a spokesperson for Israel's Antiquities Authority (IAA). "It is an extraordinary discovery." A total of seven scrolls, with portions missing due to their fragile state over time, were brought into custody. Experts estimate they are between 2,000 and 3,000 years old, shedding light on the religious practices in Judea during biblical times when Jerusalem was divided by a wall around its walled city; only Jews could enter it at that time because of strict segregation.

"This discovery brings us one step closer to understanding how ancient Israelites lived their lives and practiced religion," an IAA official remarked while noting the scrolls are being carefully restored in Jerusalem's Rockefeller Museum, with some already showing Hebrew letters on pottery fragments likely representing liturgical texts used for religious rituals.

The boy was named Eliyahu Aminavicius (14 years old), who lives about 50 meters from where the scroll-bearing jars were uncovered by a Bedouin shepherd near his family's home in Kibbutz Shiloh, overlooking Qumran Cave I. He was playing outside with friends when he noticed something that looked like glass among some stones on June 9th of last year and began to carefully sift through the debris for seeds but instead found three ancient jars containing scroll fragments in good condition by his fifth attempt at digging inside one of them, Reuters reported.

Inside was a rolled-up piece with Hebrew writing on it that he couldn't understand and believed to be an old map; after taking the jar back into his bedroom for safekeeping until IAA authorities arrived — which they did within hours as Bedouin boys are often aware of any significant finds in Israel due to their livelihood depending upon tourism revenue from archaeological sites there, Haaretz notes.

The boy brought a sample piece with him when he first visited the Antiquities Authority site on June 12th last year; however it was later determined by IAA archeologists and scholars that some of its text represents prayers or benedictions rather than directions because many scrolls found at nearby Qumran Cave II have biblical texts, The Jerusalem Post notes.

The boy has been visiting the site regularly since then for guidance from IAA professionals while waiting to see what else may be hidden inside his newly discovered cave; it is unknown if he and other locals will become professional excavators working alongside scholars on future expeditions once additional finds are made public, or remain as tour guides.
