A Hollywood actor was arrested last week in Los Angeles on suspicion of embezzlement from a charity event fund held by nonprofit organization Giving Hearts LA and its celebrity patrons. Jonathan Price, known for his roles in blockbuster films like "Titanic II" and the upcoming sci-fi sequel "Galactic Wars," was detained last Friday after authorities uncovered discrepancies between charitable donations received during a fundraiser event at Beverly Hills Hotel on March 21st, where celebrities including Price were in attendance.

The nonpromediate financial investigators found that over $500,000 went missing from the celebrity-led campaign after guests filed their receipts for cash donations and entry fees to a charity ball aimed at supporting underprivileged children with educational resources in Los Angeles.

While reviewing documents that day at City Hall alongside Price and others, Rydstrom stumbled upon inconsistencies between recorded donations versus guest receispts. After his discovery went unnoticed by event organizers for two days following the charity ball before he decided to go public on social media last weekend when it quickly garnered significant attention due partly to celebrities like Price being mentioned in posts, prompting law enforcement officials' interest as they stepped into investigative roles yesterday.

A former Giving Hearts LA volunteer and close friend of the nonprofit who wishes anonymity said about 75%-80% of guests claimed to attend were celebrities or influencers themselves, noting "a clear divide between those genuinely donating versus others just wanting a 'cool experience' — which is where Jonathan Price comes into this."

The friend explained that despite some guest complaints about the charity event being too commercialized and less focused on its core mission of supporting children with education, it seemed like no one wanted
