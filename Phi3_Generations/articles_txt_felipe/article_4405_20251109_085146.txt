In a jaw-dropping Monday night game at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, on September 12th, quarterback Joe Montgomery of the New York Jets made an unprecedented and controversial decision that shocked fans nationwide. The veteran playmaker threw backward to his right tight end with just seconds remaining in a crucial Week 7 matchup against the Miami Dolphins — a pass typically reserved for last-minse scenarios or critical fourth down situations, not when trailing by four points late in regulation time.

The decision came after Montgomery noticed that left tackle and team captain AJ Fountain had injured his ankle during warmups earlier at MetLife Stadium before kickoff; the Dolphins subsequently decided to start their backup from a youth position as well, making it all but impossible for New York Jets offense's best line of scrimmage protection. 

"I saw AJ Fountain limping and knew he couldn’t perform at his full capacity," said Montgomery after the game in an emotional press conference with reporters from across various sports media platforms, including The New York Times among others. "We're not afraid to throw deep when we need it as a team; today was one of those times."

AJ Fountain tried but could only manage two more snaps before the injury forced him off for good and he was replaced by rookie Tyler Conroy, who couldn’t handle rushing assignments adequately. New York Jets head coach Mike La Femme expressed disappointment with Montgomery's decision to take a backward pass late in regulation time during his post-game press conference at the team hotel located about two miles from MetLife Stadium: "I cannot overstate my dismay that Joe threw a tipped and incomplete forward throw when we were down 4-0. It was absolutely unnecessary."

Jets backup quarterback Charlie Wilson, who came on for Montgomery with just under five minutes remaining in regulation time had managed to rally the Jets back into contention but ultimately failed by missing an open receiver resulting in a fumble and subsequent turnover that led directly towards New York losing. 

Sports analysts from ESPN, Fox Sports Network (FSNN), NBC's Today Show, CBS’s Inside Edition all weighed in on Montgomery's decision: "Monty threw for the first-down without checking down," said an expert quoted by SB Nation. The experts agreed that this was unnecessary given Miami's dominant defense and Jets backup quarterback Charlie Wilson being ready to throw if needed - which ultimately led to them losing 26–17, putting their season record at five wins for four losses with one game remaining before the NFC wild card schedule kicks off.

Despite his decision going against conventional wisdom among NFL players and coaches alike as per experts' statements; Montgomery still receives credit from some fans who see him stepping out of comfort zone to win a crucial time-sensitive game which he ultimately did not: "I thought Joe was brave for throwing backward, especially when we were down," said avid Jets fan Sarah Brown during an online live chat on NFL.com's message board after the Monday night matchup finished at 19 minutes and two seconds into overtime time with Miami leading by seven points.

However many are not happy as Montgomery, known to
