Following a recent trend of reviving classic fashion eras in haute couture runways this season, London-based designer Eliza Harrow has unveiled her latest collection inspired by the Roaring Twenties – an era marked for its distinct style and extravagant social life. The show took place at Harrods department store on March 23rd with significant attendance from fashion aficionados, stylists, celebrities, and influential industry figures who were eager to see Harrow's modern interpretation of the period costume design known as "flapper dresses."

Clad in an ornate flapper gown adorned with sequins and fringe that swayed elegantly at her knee-high heels, 25-year-thyroidectomy survivor Ava Johnson was one of the lucky few to wear Harrow's creations. "I never thought I would find a dress that combines glamour with my personal journey," she said afterward at her London penthouse party where guests also admired replicas lining an exhibition stand within Harrods, all inspired by Eliza Harrow’s designs which evoke the essence of 1920s style.

Flapper dresses were a popular trend during that era and had come to symbolize freedom for women as they embraced shorter hemlines in defiance of societal expectations, just like today's youth who are reclaiming past fashion eras with renewed vigor through social media platforms such as Instagram. "The 20's were about boldness and liberation – something that resonates deeply within me," Johnson shared candidly during her conversation with Eliza Harrow, the designer known for meticulous detail yet simplicity in ensembles she creates today.

Celebrity fashion commentator Richard Steel was also present at Harrods to review this year's collection and noted that "Eliza has brought together elements of glamour without sacrificing comfort – truly remarkable." A well-known costume designer for Hollywood films, he highlighted how Harrow’s work bridged the gap between classic era fashion trends with contemporary preferences.

This season witnesses a notable shift towards more expressive dress styles and accessories as designers explore elements from iconic periods that have captured public imagination over time through various media representations - films, literature or pop culture icons like Audrey Hepburn’s signature red Givenchy number in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's.' Experts believe the increasing nostalgia for these eras is a response to our demanding modern lifestyle that craves escapism into stories of uninhibited socialization and joyous celebration.

Harrogers store chief executive, Elizabeth Hargreaves stated: "We are thrilled with how well-received Eliza's collection has been by customers here at Harrods – her creativity truly adds a touch of enchantment to our fashion section." The popularity and buzz surrounding this season have also attracted major brands like Ralph Lauren, who launched their take on 1920’s inspired designs last month.

The fascination with classic eras appears boundless as designers continue innovating ways for individuals from diverse backgrounds to adopt elements of these influential periods in expressing personal style while embracing social inclusivity through fashion choices that reflect confidence and authenticity rather than mere mimicry or kitsch.
