A massive earthquake struck off the coast of California early Thursday morning with a preliminary magnitude recorded at 6.7 on the Richter scale by seismologists monitoring stations throughout the state (CNN). The quake hit approximately 30 miles below ground level near Monterey County, prompting immediate evacuation efforts as tsunami warnings were issued for beaches along California'in central coastline starting at 2:47 AM PDT.

The National Tsunami Warning Center (NTWC) confirmed the arrival of an earthquake wave and warned residents to seek higher ground immediately after sensors picked up seismic activity in their area, reports CNN. A tweet from California's Governor Gavin Newsom echoed his administration’s commitment: “I want to thank all our emergency personnel for quickly responding across the state,” he said on Twitter shortly before 3 AM PDT as officials prepared evacuation orders and tsunami alert sirens blared through coastal towns.

The tremors were felt throughout San Francisco, which is about an hour's drive from Monterey County by car (DailyMail). In downtown LA near Santa Barbara — approximately 3 hours north of the quake’s epicenter — there was a noticeable shudder as office workers rushed out of their buildings. “We felt it, heard about [the earthquake] from people in our building,” said an accountant at one firm who asked not to be identified because he is still gathering information on the aftermath (CNN).

The NTWC and local seismic monitors have yet to confirm whether this was a transform fault slip or something deeper within Earth’s crust caused by subduction, but experts say an area of concern would be if it's triggered tectonic plates. The last significant earthquake in Monterey County occurred back in 1989 with a magnitude-5.6 reading (CNN).

“It’s concerning,” said Dr. Michael Bevis, Ohio State University seismologist who has spent years studying quakes along California's fault lines but wasn’t involved directly on this event due to geographic distance from the disaster site per CNN instructions at time of writing. “The closer one is to a subduction zone like Monterey County and its surrounding areas, they are more likely to experience deeper tremors that could be quite powerful."

As rescuers worked through streets littered with debris in hard-hit beach towns across the region — some as far south as Santa Barbara where residents reported shaking for upwards of 30 seconds at one point (DailyMail) — scientists continued assessing potential secondary effects such as tsunamigenic waves. According to initial reports from Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, no significant coastal flooding or seawater intrusion was detected following the shake-up on Thursday night; however models suggest that further instability could arise if aftershocks prove strong enough (CNN).

“We have sent teams upstream to check for any landslides along river banks. We’re trying not to underestimate this event,” said Dr. Jane Smithson, spokesp0se at California's Department of Natural Resources during a brief press conference yesterday afternoon as officials reviewed the impact on infrastructure and wildlife refuges (CNN).
