In a dramatic series of events unfolding in Jakarta on Saturday night, local authorities have reported that multiple fire trucks responded to an industrial complex where four individuals tragically lost their lives due to extensive flooding and submerged equipment caused by the sudden downpour. As many as eight people are still unaccounted for amidst rising water levels in Jakarta's Ciliwane Industrial Park, which is situated near several major transport hubs within Southeast Asia’ extraterritorial capital city of Indonesia.

The disaster occurred at around 6:45 PM local time when a downpour unleashed its fury over the densely populated urban landscape that already struggles with one of the world's fastest-growing cities and severe drainage issues, reports CNN affiliate JAKARTA PADA. Eyewitness accounts from nearby workers describe how heavy rains led to flash flooding within a matter of hours as factories located alongside riverside were quickly inundated with water carrying industrial debris such as machinery and metal parts.

Six firefighters, hailed for their efforts by the Jakarta Fire Brigade chief Arief Setiawan last night at 9:30 PM local time said they had no choice but to evacuate people trapped inside a heavily contaminated warehouse before attempting rescue operations after an estimated five hours of relentless work. "It's tough when we find survivors amidst such devastating conditions, the challenges are immense," says Setiawan about his brave firefighters responding to one of their worst-ever industrial fires in Jakarta's history which is being closely monitored by local and international news outlets.

Indonesian President Joko Widodo expressed condolences for those affected, adding that the government was working with disaster agencies across the nation as it braces itself to respond effectively amidst potential aftershock waves predicted following this natural catastrophe on Saturday night in Jakarta's southwest region. The National Disaster Management Agency head, Dwikora said their team of 30 rescuers were working round-the-clock and dispatched more specialist teams to the industrial complex since Wednesday when they first noticed unusual activity at one facility there after receiving reports that a section within appeared severely damaged.

"Our priority has been ensuring those affected receive immediate assistance while also assessing environmental impacts from this unfortunate incident," Dwikora added in an interview with CNN affiliate JAKARTA PADA before declaring they needed more help on Monday to continue rescue efforts throughout the night as water receded following Sunday's flooding. "We have been doing all we can, but every life lost and still missing is a tragedy," said Dwikora about their work battling unprecedented circumstances over the weekend which saw Jakarta submerged with record-breaking rainfall levels reaching 140mm per hour.

A spokesperson for an affected factory operator tells CNN affiliate JAKARTA PADA they are providing temporary shelter and necessary food supplies to around 35 workers currently residing within the site despite being unable to return home themselves due to floodwaters surrounding their facilities since Thursday. The Jakarta Electricity Supply Company is also working hard on maintaining power supply in affected areas as it monitors local electric grids, which are reported by some sources
