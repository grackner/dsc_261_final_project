NHL fans across North America hold their breath as a season-deciding matchup in New York City takes place tonight at Madison Square Garden under unique conditions due to an ongoing citywide power outage sparked by the recent snowstorm that hit early this week, reports CNN. The regular schedule was disrupted when 27 inches of snow blanketed parts of Manhattan and caused a blackout just hours before tonight's game between rivals, the New York Rangers and Philadelphia Flyers at Madison Square Garden in downtthy area (February 8).

Early this week’s relentless storm has left nearly five million people without power across several states. As of Wednesday morning local time, over half a dozen major metropolitan areas were still grappling with the aftermath; New York City being one of them where snow and ice forced evacuations from nursing homes on Tuesday night (February 7).

But hockey fans had little concern about darkness or freezing temperatures when tonight's matchup at Madison Square Garden drew attention nationwide. The National Hockey League postponed the game as a precaution, but officials say it is likely to proceed after power lines are repaired and all essential facilities have access to electricity before kick-off time on Friday night (February 10).

"We understand that this situation may be frustrating for many," said NHL spokesperson Chris Fiege in a statement. "Our top priority is the safety of our players and staff, which includes providing indoor venues with reliable electricity." The postponement decision was met by some fans who expressed their disappointment on social media platforms like Twitter while others were relieved for security reasons that have not been confirmed yet.

Several officials from NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio's office, the Department of Transportation and other city agencies worked round-the-clock to restore power lines as quickly as possible amidst an unprecedented snowfall; however their efforts are only just beginning according to Fiege. "This is going beyond what we expected at first," he said during Wednesday's press conference on the storm in Manhattan. “It’ll take a couple more days for repairs and cleaning before normalcy returns, but rest assured that our commitment remains as strong now as ever."

Local authorities urged residents to stay indoors due to potential ice hazards while announcing an end date of February 12th. The NHL responded by postponing tonight's matchup between the Rangers and Flyers at Madison Square Garden until Friday night (February 10). "We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause our fans," said Fiege during today’s conference call with reporters. “Our teams are eager to play, but we cannot compromise safety."

In an interview yesterday at his home in Queens where he remained sheltered due to blackout-affected areas like Manhattan being declared a curfew zone; Rangers captain Ryan Stanton admitted that this situation might be one of the most challenging experiences for players and fans alike. "It's never easy when our plans are interrupted by unforeseen circumstances, but we remain hopeful," he said while waiting patiently on his family’s couch next to a pile of blankets in front of an electric space heater powered solely from
