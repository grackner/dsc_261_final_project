A heatwave scorching across Europe is setting new temperature records and prompting extreme measures to keep citizens safe from soaring temperatures expected in July, as scientists urge governments for immediate action on climate change mitigation strategies. In the UK, which has already experienced record-breaking summer highs this year, experts anticipate that by mid-July, London could see a sweltering 40°C (104°F) in some areas under current emission trends, according to climate models and data released yesterday.

The Met Office issued heat health warnings last week due to the likelihood of temperatures exceeding historical maximums for this time of year across several regions including southern France, Italy's Lazio region (which includes Rome), Spain’th Balearic Islandsand Greece itself with peak highs potentially reaching as much as 50°C(122°F) in these locations.

The European heatwave is believed to be caused by a strong atmospheric ridge, known colloquially as an 'atmospheric dome,' trapping warm air underneath it over the continent's southern regions and leading to what meteorologists have dubbed "unprecedented" conditions.

Professor Jane Smithson the Director of Meteorological Research at Kings College London, commented on these extreme temperatures stating: "The current weather patterns are alarming as they underscore just how little we understand about predictive climate modeling and its limitations in forecasting such 'atmospheric domes.'"

CNN's own meteorologists confirm that the heat dome forming over western Europe is highly unusual, with temperatures expected to remain elevated for upcoming weeks. The European Environmental Agency (EEA) has already expressed concerns about water shortages in vulnerable regions such as Spain and Greece where reservoir levels have dwindled by 20% due to the heatwave-induced evaporation rates, exacerbating an ongoing drought that's been persistent over several months.

In response to this crisis climate scientist Dr Andrew Thompson said "The scientific community has long warned about these escalated events as a result of increasing global temperatures and human activity." He further stated: “It’s no longer just future predictions we have; it is the harsh reality unfolding before our eyes. This should be an urgent call to action for immediate climate change mitigation, adaptation strategies along with investment in resilient infrastructure.”

Governments across Europe are rushing to implement emergency heat measures while experts stress that these extreme weather events will likely become the new norm if carbon emissions continue at current rates. The European Commission is planning a multi-faceted approach including expanding urban green spaces and public water cooling stations in high-risk areas, along with promoting energy efficiency to curb air conditioner use during peak hours across industries as part of their immediate response plan released yesterday afternoon.

"These are challenges that we must confront head on," commented EU Climate Commissioner Miguel Arias Manual who spoke at a press conference last evening about the steps being taken by his office, adding: "We're working closely with governments across Europe to roll out our plan and ensure necessary resources for immediate mitigation efforts are mobilized."

As nations prepare themselves against these rising temperatures people have started taking personal measures as well. The British Weather Foundation has been monitoring social media responses
