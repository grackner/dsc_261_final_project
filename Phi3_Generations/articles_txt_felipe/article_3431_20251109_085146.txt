As a major Hollywood actress was spotted on vacation at Bora Bora last weekend with her husband and their two children, fans were abuzz about what this means for the couple's relationship status amidst rumors of separation swirling around them in recent months. The highly anticipated return trip from Oceania appears to have taken place between July 10-15, according to several insiders familiar with their schedule who requested anonymity due to privacy concerns over the couple's personal life being so publicized recently.

Known for her roles in blockbuster movies and television shows alike, actress Sarah Johnson has seen better days behind closed doors after rumors of marital troubles surfaced last year following a spat during one of their film shoots on the set of "The Final Curtain". Since then, she took breaks from work to deal with these issues but returned for her latest movie role which premieres later this month.

Sources close to Sarah and John Doe have disclosed that despite an extremely hectic lifestyle due to their respective careers as well as the challenges they faced in balancing motherhood, things started taking a turn when she began seeking advice from her child psychologist friend Emily Roberts on how best manage stress for herself and children.

"The Doe family has always been an integral part of Hollywood entertainment; I first met them during filming back in 2015," says Dr. Emily Roberts, a well-known Los Angeles based licensed child psychologist who specializes in helping actors navigate the highs and lows associated with their careers impact on family dynamics. "I knew then they were going through something hard but I didn't realize it until things started escalating last year when we all saw them during that film shoot."

"Sarah was always a tough nut to crack, so her situation wasn't easy for me as an outsider," Roberts continues. "I think what people may not understand is the impact these issues can have on children - they don't necessarily see things from their parental perspective but when mom and dad aren't communicating well it affects them too."

In a recent interview, Sarah admitted that while she did want to be transparent with her fans about what was happening at home due to the media scrutiny this issue has brought attention towards celebrities themselves. "I never intended for my personal life become public knowledge," says Johnson when asked if sharing details of their issues on social media platforms could help bring some clarity amongst rumors and speculations over whether she's having an affair or not, though neither John nor Sarah admitted to such behaviors in any form during our conversations.

"We love each other very much as a family," Johnson continues before admitting that since starting couples therapy sessions with their child psychologist earlier this year after taking the decision together last fall at her suggestion and his wife's request for professional help, they have seen improvements in how they communicate daily not just between themselves but also to our children.

"Everyone deals with hard times differently," says Roberts when asked if she sees hope in their situation or whether things will eventually break down despite some progress being made towards resolving issues at home since starting the therapy sessions earlier this year following last fall's request for professional help by Sarah and his wife. "The biggest thing here is that they want to fix what has been broken - something we don't often see in Hollywood where egos sometimes run high."
