In a landmark move for air travel efficiency and customer satisfaction, Airline Alpha announced this morning that they will introduce mandatory in-flight entertainment systems on all domestic flights starting next month. The decision follows years of complaints from frequent flyers about the dullness of transpiring time abocuriously spent gazing at blank ceilings and sleep patterns disrupted by endless takeoffs, landings, or turbulence that often leads to restless nights upon arrival.

"It's long overdue for us in aviation," said the CEO of Airline Alpha during a press conference on Wednesday at their headquarters near Atlanta International Airport (ATL). "We recognize this is an investment but improving our customers’ experience brings more business to all involved." The move will reportedly affect around 1.5 million passengers each month, according to company estimates shared with reporters today ahead of the official press release planned for Friday morning at ATL headquarters and online later on CNN Travel's website.

The entertainment package is set to be diverse, ranging from streaming movies available in multiple languages via Airline Alpha’s app or provided headsets, all-access music playlists curated by the airline themselves as well as live events including Q&A sessions with experts during long flights.

"I am confident this decision is going to make traveling much more enjoyable," said a frequent flier and aviation enthusiast who flew regularly on Air Alpha, Michael Johnson from New York City after speaking at length about his experiences for an hour today in front of the press gathered inside the glass-and-steel conference room.

As airline executives prepare to roll out their ambitious plan this month across all domestic flights within and outside major hubs such as Los Angeles (LAX), Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW), Chicago O’Hare International Airport (ORD), Denver International Airport (DEN), Miami International Airport (MIA) New York JFK, Boston Logan Int'l. airport and others, the entertainment sector is set to welcome a new era in aviation with much anticipation on how this development will change the perception of millions towards their daily commute across continents or domestic travels between cities spread far from one another geographically.

Airline Alpha's announcement comes at a time when competitors like Delta Air Lines and JetBlue have already experimented with offering some in-flight entertainment features, including onboard WiFi service for passengers willing to pay extra fees since 2017 and streaming services available only via individual app purchase respectively.

"We believe that this is a more comprehensive approach which will benefit our entire customer base as opposed to the select few," said an executive spokesps at Airline Alpha, speaking in confidence ahead of their announcement on Friday morning's press conference when asked for his thoughts about competitors rolling out such initiatives.

The move has also brought back nostalgia among some passengers who remember days gone by where reading a good book during the flight was commonplace but soon became unpopular due to changing priorities and evolving technologies, leading companies like Airline Alpha now aiming to capitalize on such opportunities through an all-encompassing package that goes beyond simple entertainment.

"This will bring back memories for some passengers as well," said a historian specializing in transportation history from
