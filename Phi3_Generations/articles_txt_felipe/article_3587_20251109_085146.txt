In a surprising and heartwarming gesture of charitable giving, Hollywood A-lister Eliza Thornberry has pledged to donate $10 million over the next five years in support of various homeless shelters across Los Angeles County. The generosthouse celebrity announced her intention yesterday during a star-studded event at Rodeo Drive's iconic Gucci boutique, where she was surrounded by fellow stars and industry influencers to discuss community engagement efforts within the city known for its vibrant entertainment scene.

The 35-year-old actress has been actively involved in philanthropy throughout her career but reveals that meeting with individuals experiencing homelessness firsthand prompted a more significant commitment last year when she spent time volunteering at the Skid Row shelter, which serves as an oasis amidst Los Angeles's harsh economic divide. Inspired by what Thornberry saw and experienced there, her resolve solidified with this groundbreaking pledge to channel her considerable wealth into making a tangible difference for those most vulnerable in one of America’s largest cities – home to some 10,718 homeless individuals per the latest Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority count conducted last fall.

"I've always been passionate about giving back and using my platform as an actress not just on stage but off-stage too," Thornberry said during her impassioned speech at Rodeo Drive, which drew a sold-out crowd of influential industry folks including director Tim Benson (who directed the Oscar-nominated film "Celeb Life" featuring Eliza), and producer Sarah Grant.

Benson noted how Thornberry's philanthropic vision could serve as an example to her peers: "Eliza’s commitment will undoubtedly encourage other celebrities within our industry that charitable work can be a natural extension of their career, bringing joy and hope directly into the lives of those who need it most."

Grant emphasized not only Thornberry's significant impact on society but also her genuine desire to help: "It’s evident Eliza isn't just doing this for tax benefits or publicity; she truly cares about making a difference in Los Angeles. Her generosity will undoubtedly inspire others."

In addition, several non-profit organizations expressed appreciation and gratitude towards Thornberry: "Eliza has always been an influential advocate for change within our community," shared Michael Evans of the Salvation Army LA Metro division; “Her $10 million commitment will bring much needed resources to programs like housing first, providing a pathway out from homelessness and into self-sufficiency.”

Looking towards her donations' implementation plan – The Hollywood Star Foundation has been chosen as executor for Thornberry’s philanthropic fund. With financial advisors in place already working with the foundation to ensure ethical management of funds, projects will start being planned immediately; plans include building affordable housing units near existing shelters and organizing job training programs tailored specifically towards homeless individuals looking to rejoin society as productive members once again.

The local mayor's office has expressed their commitment in amplifying the impact of Thornberry’s gift: "In partnership with The Hollywood Star Foundation, we will work tirelessly to ensure Eliza's generous donation creates lasting change for those experien04
