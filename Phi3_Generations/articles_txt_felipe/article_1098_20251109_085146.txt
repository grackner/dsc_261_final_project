A massive earthquake rocked a densely populated region in South America early this morning as residents were already grappling with severe flooding last weekend. The quake struck at precisely 5:32 AM local time, registering a magnitude of 7.8 on the Richter scale and causing widespinfrastructure damage across multiple provinces that are home to millions of people in Colombia.

The epicenter was located near Cúcuta -a city already devastated by flooding last weekend- which sits along a major seismic fault line known as the Eastern Ranges or Mares de Morichales, where tremors frequently occur but rarely escalate to this magnitude. A spokesperson for Colombia's National Civil Protection Authority says: "This was an unprecedented event and we are working round-the-clock to assess its full impact on the affected regions."

According to initial estimates, at least 30 people have been confirmed dead with hundreds injured in the quake. Many of them were likely caught off guard by both disasters as seismic tremors continue unabatedly throughout Colombia's northeastern provinces -described collectively on Twitter simply as 'Cúcuta- where they had only recently begun to pick up belongings from floodwaters or find temporary shelter.

"We were just getting ready for evacuation centers when the ground began shaking," said Juanita Gomez, who lost everything she owned in both calamities and has since been taking refuge with her family on a friend's farm two hours away from Cúcuta- but still within one of the regions hardest hit by natural disaster.

Federal authorities have sent rescue crews to affected areas while local police are working tirelessly throughout 24/7 shifts amid reports that looting and violence is beginning to surface in some neighborhoods with no electricity or running water for several days now as the government struggles to provide basic necessities.

Civil Defense Director General Carlos Rivera, who has been coordinating rescue efforts between multiple agencies since last Saturday's flooding tragedy and today's seismic disaster, said: "The situation is dire but we are trying our best amidst the limited resources at hand." He acknowledges that a massive rebuilding effort will be needed as damaged roads hinder access into rural regions- where landslides have also been reported.

Experts fear it's too early to call this weekend safe for heavy rainfall on top of already saturated ground and high winds, which may cause secondary flooding in the coming days across provinces like Norte de Santander, Casanare, Cesar, Boyaca, and Antioquia- that account for about 12% of Colombia's total population.

A representative from local universities who studies geological activity along seismic fault lines commented: "This is a rare event in the region with no immediate forecast to predict more tremors or aftershock sequences but we cannot be complacent as it happened last weekend." 

Efforts are underway for temporary housing, food distribution points and supply drops by helicopter where needed. The government has declared a state of emergency in Cúcuta which will remain so until further notice with the aim to restore basic services -electricity-, clean drinking water- via tanker trucks or generators-, potable
