In a stunning display of skill and teamwork on Tuesday night at Wembley Stadium in London, Manchester United clinched a dramatic victory against Chelsea with a score of 2-1 thanks to goals by Marcus Rashford (right wing) and Bruno Fernandes. The win secures the Premier League title for United after an adrenaline-fueled match that had fans on edge throughout all six divisions, leading commentators as they praised both teams' resilience in tight games this season.

As night fell over England’s capital and football lovers filled Wembley Stadium eager to witness the much anticipated clash between two of Europe's most famous clubs – Manchester United with a record 12 championships under their belt, Chelsea boasting eight — tensions reached an all-time high. Ramsay Soref (47), head coach for both teams and one of the best minds in football had prepared his players mentally and physically after months without play because of a stringent lockdown which halted last year’s title race between these titans, as well as this season's contenders.

Marcus Rashford scored first for Manchester United just 5 minutes into the game with what head coach Ole Gunnar Solskjaer called "a brilliant free-kick" by his right wing that left fans and commentators alike stunned in disbelief at how he made it look so easy, while Bruno Fernandes scored late on for Chelsea to equalize after Rashford's goal. However, the Manchester side managed a remarkable turnaround within 10 minutes with Christian Eriksen scoring from just outside his area by capitalizing on an uncharacteristically weak challenge made by Ruddy Smith who was sent off earlier in the half.

“I’ve never seen anything quite like that,” Solskjaer said, referring to Rashford's goal which came after Chelsea had already equalized from Fernandes. "Marcus has always been a clinical finisher and tonight was no different." Eriksen echoed this as he celebrated his first-half strike with the Manchester club motto - 'There Is Always Enough Time'.

Injuries, suspensions and other off-pitch matters were not able to take their usual place on center stage. As Solskjaer put it after a momentous half hour: "We've been dealing with injuries all season – players who have missed games for the rest of this campaign are no longer missing."

While Manchester ended up as champions, Chelsea was left heartbroken and reflective on what could’ve been their best title-winning team in history. Owner Roman Abramovich expressed his disappointment while also paying tribute to the "phenomenal effort" from both teams: “I know this is a difficult time for everyone, especially after such an epic season where we had some of our greatest moments."

As fans leave Wembley Stadium and head home satiated with their team's win while still buzzing about the intense gameplay they just witnessed – it’ll take several days before both clubs can properly digest what happened on Tuesday night. The real next steps for United start as early as Thursday when training camp commences, but until then we wait with baited breath to see who will be named in the Manchester squad at Old Trafford's
