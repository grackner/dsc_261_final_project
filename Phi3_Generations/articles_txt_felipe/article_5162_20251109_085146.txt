In a groundbredeal that could herald significant changes in public health policy worldwide, researchers at Johns Hopkins University have released findings from a decade-long study on the relationship between sugar consumption and chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. Published today by The Lancet Public Health Journal, this extensive work looked into diverse populations across 12 countries including the United States, China, Brazil, Nigeria, India, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Africa, Russia, and Mexico between June 2010 to May 2020.

"What we found was quite striking; it's not just about sugar in isolation but how processed sugars are consumed that contribute heavily towards chronic diseases," says Dr. Elizabeth Ramirez, the lead investigator and head of Public Health Nutrition at Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health.

The study surveyed dietary habits among 10 million adults aged between 25 to 64 years from a representative sample in each nation using food frequency questionnaires (FFQ). Participants were asked about their sugar intake, specifically focusing on added sugars found not only in sweets but also processed and packaged goods like ketchup, breads, pasta sauces. The average daily consumption of 'added' or 'processed' sugars across the 12 countries ranged from a low of around 8% to as high as almost half (49%) by sugar-laden food producers in Mexico — which is significantly higher than guidelines set by health authorities worldwide.

In many developing nations such as Nigeria and South Africa, accessibility and affordability often result in a heavy reliance on cheap refined sugars for daily energy needs with little to no knowledge about its adverse effects among the population - an alarming trend that has been largely overlooked until now. 

The research also noted cultural influences shaping dietary habits and added, "We observed significant variations in sugar intake between urban/rural areas even within one country suggesting a strong role of local culture". This could potentially be an important determinant for future public health interventions by tailoring messages to resonate with specific communities.

Dr. Ramirez stresses the need to educate people about hidden sugars in packaged food, "Educating individuals on reading labels and making informed choices is vital". The study's findings are a call for action not only from governments but also corporations producing high-sugar products – urging them towards healthier alternatives without compromising taste.

In response to the publication of this global report, representatives from various nations expressed concern and determination to reduce added sugar consumption in their respective countries through improved nutrition education programs as well a revision on dietary recommendations issued by local food agencies based upon these findings. 

A key figure at WHO has welcomed the research adding, "It provides robust evidence for us all — consumers and industry alike – to re-evaluate our priorities". With this report making a compelling case on reducing sugar intake from various sources beyond just limiting sweets, hopes are high that these findings will prompt world leaders at their upcoming UN summit in September 2023 where public health policies related to diet and food production would be discussed as part of the agenda.
