In a recent development in Central African Republic (CAR), multiple armed groups have seized control of key towns near Bambari city center on Friday night, reports CNN's International Desk and Africa Correspondent Sarah Awotowa. The situation has escalated tensions further into the region just months after violence broke out between rival factions there during a disputed election in 2decyseptember—the first time an armed conflict of this magnitude took place on African soil since South Sudan split from its southern neighbor in mid-2011.

The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, stated that there is a significant risk the hostilities could expand if immediate action isn't taken to resolve these tensions peacefully across CAR and surrounding nations such as Cameroon where Central African rebels often find refuge or support.

"The people of Sudan are tired; they want stability for themselves," said Mohamed Hamdan Hussein, a local leader in the conflict-ridden region who has been advocating dialogue between all factions involved since last year's turmoil started when President Faustin Archange Touadéra was sworn into office amid allegations of vote rigging and fraud.

In Bambari, some 30 miles northwest from Bangui the nation's capital city where government forces have been fighting separatists seeking independence for the troubled region known as 'South Kordula,' three militant groups claim to share a common goal of establishing autonomy while each has their own leadership and agenda - yet they frequently clash with one another. 

"The people here want peace; we just demand that our voices are heard," said Amina Diallo, mother of two who lost her children in previous conflicts between the different factions within CAR since independence from France back in December 1960 - more than five decades ago but still remembered with pain today by many. "Our community has suffered enough violence; now we need help."

On Friday night, as thousands of displaced civilians attempted to return home amid the escalating violence near Bambari city center after weeks spent in temporary shelters set up around town and at nearby camps for refugees seeking safety from Central African's ongoing conflict — including a rebel camp established by former Sudanese leader Omar al-Bashir who had fled to neighboring Chad before being deposed himself.

The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported earlier this week that at least 3,000 people were displaced in Bambari alone with numbers believed much higher since security forces have barred most journalists from entering conflict zones where reporting is extremely dangerous due to a constant threat posed by the presence of armed groups.

CNN's Africa Correspondent Sarah Awotowa told us that her latest visit was made after days spent in contacting local sources through aid organizations and residents near Bambari, but even then information proved hard to come by amidst ongoing chaos as hostilities raged around them at nightfall.

"We've seen a rise of violence since last week," said Joseph Mboue, chief security officer for the Central African government who has been stationed in Bambari throughout its history and witnessing unrest firsthand during various periods including two coups d'etat (an attempted overthrow) within just five years after independence from France.
