As film lovers eager for new cinematic experiences flock to New York City this weekend for a slew of star-studded premieres and red carpet galas at the Metropolitan Opera House, tension arises as rumors circulate about one high-profile movie possibly pulling out due to production issues.

CNN sources have confirmed that director Christopher Nolan's eagerly anticipated film "The Dark Knight Rises" may not make it past its scheduled Saturday screening at the historic opera house, which has transformed into a temporary set for several weeks amidst New York City' enduring financial woes and logistical challenges.

Nolan is best known in recent years as one of Hollywood’s most revered directors with "The Dark Knight" trilogy captivating audiences worldwide since 2008, but the upcoming sequel has hit snags that have left fans and insiders worried. The Met Opera House is hosting Nolan's film as one of several productions set in its regal halls amidst New York’ enduring financial woes; however, "The Dark Knight Rises" was scheduled to return for an extra screening on Saturday afternoon that may no longer be possible due to delays caused by the problems.

Insiders say production is behind schedule and struggling with budget constraints as a result of unexpected set piece replacements needed during filming earlier this year in Los Angeles, according to sources close to Nolan's team who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the movie. 

Amid growing anxiety among fans and industry insiders alike as "The Dark Knight Rises" continues its perilous production journey across town on a temporary set at the opera house, Nolan's team is reportedly exploring alternative filming locations in New York City to salvage what remains of this ambitious cinematic project.

Sources close to Warner Bros., which produced "The Dark Knight" trilogy and released it with relative success worldwide last year after a six-year hiatus, say Nolan’s team is considering using other parts of New York City for at least one more day of shooting this month in order to complete the sequel. However, as rumors persist that "The Dark Knight Rises" might be scrapped altogether due to insurmountable setbacks, sources add some cast members are exploring career alternatives amid concern over their future roles and contractual obligations should Nolan's plans fall through entirely.

According to industry observers not associated with the production team or Warner Bros., there is widespread speculation about a potential return of director Christopher Nolan, who shot parts of "The Dark Knight Rises" last year in New York City as it transformed into an unconventional movie set amidst its enduring financial woes; however, those hopes are fading fast.

As for the opera house itself – once home to world-class musicians and now temporarily housing parts of a high-profile film production -- sources say that despite Nolan’s team working around the clock since January in an attempt at salvaging as much material from their original Los Angeles shoot, they're far behind schedule. The studio was originally scheduled to wrap up shooting this month by early August last year; however, insiders report it could be months yet before production is complete if "The Dark Knight Rises" makes the cut for release in 2023 at all, sources close to Warner
