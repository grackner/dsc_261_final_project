A groundbre endangered species recovery program in Yellowstone National Park has achieved a rare success as scientists announced that an elusive snow leopard is born for the first time since record keeping began nearly four decades ago, reports CNN and DailyMail with additional reporting. The birth of the third generation snow leopard cub took place at about 2:30 am local time on July 18th in a secluded section near Mount Doy within Yellowstone National Park's remote backcountry—an area known for its natural habitat similarities to native species across Central Asia, according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) statement released today by park officials. The snow leopard cub is one of three recently spotted in late June and early July as part of an intensive study aimed at gathering data about their population status within Yellowstone National Park—an area not typically inhabited by these big cats according to USGS biologist Dr. Emily Hurtado, who was a leading researcher on the project with her colleagues from international conservation organizations such as Panthera and WWF-Canada,"

The birth of this rare cub comes after just two snow leopard sightings in Yellowstone National Park since 1982 when scientists began monitoring these magnificent creatures. This news is particularly significant given the ongoing threats they face, including habitat loss and illegal poaching across their native regions extending from Russia to Nepal." Dr Hurtado says that while there's still much work ahead in understanding snow leopard ecology within North America,"

"Despite its near extinction throughout most of the world due to hunting for fur, habitat loss and climate change impacting their prey base, these beautiful cats have been making a slow comeback through conservation efforts overseas where they still roam free in some areas today." The snow leopard cub's birth marks an exciting development as it indicates the first generation of this endangered feline may be reproducing within Yellowstone National Park—a critical step towards their future recovery. Dr Hurtado says that although these animals are still rare and hard to spot due in part by human activity, "

"Our work is helping us understand just how adaptable snow leopards can really become when provided the right protection." The USGS biologist adds hopeful next steps for continued monitoring with plans set out over coming years including tagging of these cats and installation of motion-sensitive wildlife cameras. "

Dr Hurtado says that they will be continuing efforts to ensure a safe pathway into the park is maintained, particularly along remote backcountry areas where snow leopards are known to seek refuge in order not only for their safety but as an opportunity to learn more about these incredible animals and help contribute towards global conservation."
