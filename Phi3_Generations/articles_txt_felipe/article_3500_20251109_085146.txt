In a small town in Shandong province near Shanghai last night, an elderly couple made headlines when they quietly celebrated their hundredth wedding anniversary amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and without any public fanfare. Liu Hua, 87 years old, looks after his wife of a century while her health remains good for now as she is confined to bed rest due to age-related conditions.

As many couples commemorate their milestone in grandiose celebrations with friends and family over multiple days or weeks apart from home decorating parties lasting up to five hours, the Liu’thems chose a humble yet meaningful way of marking this special occasion: sharing an evening's meal at home.

"We wanted nothing more than peacefully spending time together after all these years," says Zhao Meiying, their youngest daughter who accompanied them to the restaurant where they ordered takeout and sat down with her parents for dinner alone in silence - a testament that love knows no bounds even as decades pass.

CNN has learned through local sources at this southern city's government offices on Thursday evening (local time), which is consistent across Asia Pacific Time Zone, that Liu Hua and wife Zhao Fangzhen tied the knot in 1923 during a rare celebration amidst World War I chaos.

Zhao Meiying recalls how her grandparents shared tales of their wedding day - standing out among other Chinese marriages as they were united not only at such an unusual time but also without the fanfare common to many nuptials held during periods ranging from late-night events through elaborate feasts and fireworks.

"I remember hearing about how grandpa Liu worked in a factory near Shanghai when he was young before meeting my grandma Zhao," she explains with fondness as her parents sit across the table at their favorite restaurant, having just visited to honor them on this night of celebration for couples like themselves who have made it through life's trials together.

A local historian tells CNN that Liu Hua and wife were wedded by a mutual friend since childhood but only got married in secret when their love was questioned amid societal pressures to find suitable matches from eligible families for both sides back then; many young couples during this era of history had limited freedoms, often needing approval or blessings before consummating a marriage.

"In our time and place – the rural township - there was no pressure like that so we thought it best not to seek anyone else's opinion for fear they might disrupt us," Liu Hua says as he reminisces about happier times spent raising four children in his beloved hometown surrounded by farmland.

With three grown-up kids now living out of town and Zhao Fangzhen bedridden, their family has become smaller over the years but not any less dedicated to keeping strong bonds that have carried them through a century together; Liu Hua's daughters recall how they were always close despite geographical separations as part of traditional Chinese values prioritizing extended families and communal ties.

"My parents never lost touch with each other - no matter where life took us, we made sure to visit home during holidays or special occasions," says Zhao Meiying fond
