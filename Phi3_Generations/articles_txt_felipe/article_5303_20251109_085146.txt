A recent study has highlighted a surprising link between romantic relationships and long-term health outcomes in New York City on Thursday. The research from Mount Sinai Hospital found that individuals who reported being happily married or involved with their partner were less likely to suffer heart attacks, strokes, and other serious cardiac events compared to those without a significant relationship (NewYorkHealthStudy-2023).

Leading the research team is Dr. Samantha Hayes who states that "the emotional support provided within healthy relationships appears to contribute significantly towards better heart health." The study involved more than 5,000 participants aged between 45 and 69 from diverse backgrounds across five boroughs in NYC over the past year.

Experts like cardiologist Dr. David Lee emphasize that "spending quality time with loved ones can lead to reduced stress levels which is directly beneficial for heart health." He adds, “Our findings underscore how important it is we take our personal relationships into consideration when advising patients on lifestyle modifications.”

Several participants like 58-year old Robert Thompson shared their experiences. "Having my wife beside me during stressful times really does make a difference," said Thompson who recently recovered from heart surgery, while his partner Maria added, “Our love gives us strength and helps keep the anxiety at bay.”

The New York City Department of Health plans to use these findings as part of their wider lifestyle advice campaign aiming for not only physical health but also emotional wellbeing. "It is essential that we understand all aspects influencing our heart's vitality," said Dr. Hayes, looking forward to further research in this emerging field and more concrete ways the city can leverage these findings into practical public guidance on improving cardiovascular health through nurturing relationships.
