India reports highest daily cases in over six months as health experts raise concerns about a possible fourth wave amid festive season gatherings and laxer restrictions compared to previous lockdown periods | World News | The Daily Mail Online


In an alarming trend that has taken hold across the nation, India reported its largest single-day spike in COVID-19 cases since October 2020 last week. Health officials are bracing for a potential fourth wave as case numbers begin to climb once again amid relaxed public health measures and festivities during Diwali (November 4–8) and Christmas Eve celebrations this month, reports the Times of India with additional reporting by Reuters.


As millions gather in homes across religious communities for yearly celebrations — some indoors due to cold weather conditions that can exacerbate respiratory issues like COVID-19 — public health experts warn about a possible surge if precautions are not strictly followed, according to the Indian Express.

"The key now is to remain vigilant and adhere strictly to safety protocols." The Times of India cited experts in the article, who warned that without proper mitigation measures during high-risk seasons such as this one could see a fourth wave emerge similar or worse than what was witnessed last year when hospitals were overwhelmed and thousands lost their lives.

"We're at an interesting crossroad," said epidemiologist Dr. Radhika Sharma from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Delhi, "The festive season usually brings a spike as people socialize more but with better vaccination coverage and public awareness, this time might just be different."

Reports indicate that while cases have risen by 10% over the past two weeks across various states — including Maharashtra (Mumbai), Odisha, Punjab, Gujarat, Rajasthan and West Bengal to name a few with at least three deaths reported daily since October last weekend.

The Times of India quoted Dr. Meenu Chandwani from the National Center for Disease Control (NCDC) who said that "while we do not see any signs pointing towards an imminent fourth wave, it's essential to maintain caution and follow guidelines." Health experts urge people continue practicing social distancing as they work tirelessly with the government on boosting vaccinations for those aged between 12-45 years who are yet unvaccinated.

Reports indicate that over two million new COVID cases were reported worldwide last week alone — most of which come from countries in South America, Europe and Southeast Asia according to the World Health Organization (WHO). As many nations grapple with increasing case counts amid a surge attributed by health experts as Delta variant.

"The emergence of more transmissible variants like BA-2/5 is cause for concern," said Dr Rajesh Mal
