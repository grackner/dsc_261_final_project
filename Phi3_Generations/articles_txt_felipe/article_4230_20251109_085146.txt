Hannah Stevens was found safe at her Los Angeles hotel room following a night of concern over travelers reporting loud knocking sounds in their rooms last Thursday evening. The unsettling noise had prompted multiple guests to report for security, but none could identify the source or intent behind it; some even claimed they heard threats amidst the chaos that kept many awake all night.

Hotel spokeswoman Elizabeth Mendez confirmed several rooms were rattled by a mysterious force and added their guest was unharmed: "We are relieved to report our valued patron, Mrs. Stevens, remains secure in her accommodations after the unusual events that occurred on Thursday evening."

The hotel chain had no immediate explanation for what could have caused such commotion but assured patrons it would investigate further while ensuring their safety and comfort during stay: "We deeply regret any concern our guests may feel over this incident. We take matters of security within the property very seriously, therefore an investigation is underway."

Experts say that sounds like knocking are often caused by loose fixtries or something as simple as a rodent in search for shelter; however, with no evidence pointing towards those causes and witnesses claim to have heard voices during some of their scares - the hotel chain says they will remain vigilant until more information is found: "It’s important that we stay open-minded while addressing this matter. We are committed to providing a safe environment for our guests," Mendez added, adding assurance that all security measures would be reviewed and reinforced where necessary without revealing specific details about the ongoing inquiry or potential changes in policy due to fears around privacy issues brought up by some concerned patrons.

The hotel chain has since issued a statement encouraging guests who have had similar experiences not only speak with management but also reminded them that these occurrences can sometimes be attributed to innocuous causes and may resolve themselves naturally over time without needing intervention: "It's important we understand this fully before drawing conclusions," Mendez emphasized, suggesting patience was needed while they sought answers from their internal investigation team who were working around the clock.

CNN reports that despite some patrons remaining worried about future security concerns at hotels nationwide following similar experiences elsewhere in recent weeks - hotel management reassured guests these situations typically have straightforward explanations: "We will continue to monitor guest feedback and take appropriate actions as necessary," Mendez affirmed, hinting potential protocol changes if the investigation uncovered specific vulnerabilities within their system.

With no immediate conclusive evidence about what caused Mrs. Stevens or other guests anxiety last week - all parties involved hope this incident will serve as a learning point for better safety measures and that everyone can continue to relax during future travels at hotels across the United States: "I understand why some might feel uneasy after experiencing something like that," Mendez shared. She noted how their team prioritized guest welfare, adding an assurance of dedication in keeping all guests safe and secure within the hotel property without elaborating on any specific measures or responses taken during this unsettling episode: "We are dedicated to providing a comfortable stay for our valued patrons at all times."

As Mrs. Stevens prepares her return trip next month - she expressed gratitude towards management's swift response and reassurance regarding the safety of future stays, encouraging others who might feel uneasy after their own experiences: "I felt anxious when it
