A massive sinkhole has opened up in downtbonville's heart yesterday evening, swallowing a public square and astonishing onlookers as it rapidly expanded over the course of mere hours to an estimated size larger than two football fields combined at its widest point. Authorities are currently evacuating nearby residents after they were alerted by early-morning sensors detecting unusual ground movement beneath Main Street, where 35 people found themselves stranded when it suddenly started swallowing the bustling town center around 2:00 AM local time yesterday (March 17).

The sinkhole's formation has left scientists and geologists perplexed. "It happened so quickly that we can't pinpoint an exact cause," stated Dr. Rachel Summers, a leading earth science professor at the university nearby. The area had seen heavy rainfall in recent weeks which could have saturated soil beneath Main Street to unprecedented levels not experienced since record-keeping began 50 years ago this year on March 18th – an era when meteorological data was meticulously handwritten and filed by local farmers.

"This is a rare event that has captured the attention of both residents and scientists alike," said Deputy Mayor Jack Torres as he toured around in a marked patrol vehicle, stopping periodically to survey damage while assuring nearby onlookers their safety remained unthreatened for now. "We are working with federal agencies who specialize in disaster response protocols."

The sinkhole's appetite is not limited just to the square; it has claimed two vehicles and a street lamp, according to eyewitness accounts from local shopkeepers on Main Street early this morning. "It came down out of nowhere," said Maria Gonzalez, owner of The Daily Martinique Café that's been serving locals since the 1950s when records began in downtown but has seen an increase in visitors over recent years due to its historical charm and proximity.

Residents are currently being evacuated from their homes as crews work tirelessly using heavy machinery, pumps, and personnel trying to stem the damage done so far. The mayor emphasized that immediate health risks were not a concern for now but warned of potential aftershocks due in part because Main Street is built on historical foundations from decades past when construction standards have been shown by researchers such as Professor Summers "to be less robust than modern codes."

CNN's sister site, Cable News Network (a fictitious name for illustrative purposes), has reached out to local residents and officials in downtonville who can provide more information on this extraordinary sinkhole phenomenon. CNN is continuously monitoring the situation as it evolves – updates are coming from both city authorities on the groundwork needed, while geologists study ways forward given such an anomaly's rarity: "We hope to understand what triggered it and prevent similar incidents in future communities," Dr. Summers concluded with a look of resolve amidst concern for downtown’s recovery process.
