AUSTIN (CNN) A football player's career came to a sudden halt yesterday when he collapsed on the field during an Austin Lone Star Football League game at Mueller Stadium in Austin, Texas. The incident occurred just before halftime with only minutes left in the fourth quarter as Dallas Cowboys defensive lineman Anthony Smith was tackled by Houston Texans linebacker Chris Johnson while making a crucial play to stop the opponent' end zone drive on December 5th.

The collapse came after an intense match between the two formidable teams, with both sides battling fiercely for victory in this derby of Texas football talent. In his first season as Cowboys defensive coordinator and having joined from another team last offseason, Anthony Smith was expected to continue building on a successful career that saw him play 12 seasons previously at the University of Miami before being drafted by the Dallas Cowboys in the sixth round during the NFL Draft.

"I had no idea what just happened," recalls Chris Johnson who is still recovering from minor concussion-related symptoms following a hit earlier on the field that sidelined him briefly last weekend when he was tackled by an offensive player in Dallas Cowboys uniform at AT&T Stadium, which led to his teammates calling for their defensive lineman Anthony Smith. "When I got knocked down yesterday and then didn't wake up afterward until help arrived on the field -- it completely freaked me out."

Medical professionals rushed onto the pitch following an immediate 15-yard push by Austin Lone Star Football League officials to halt play as Cowboys trainers attempted unsuccessfully at reviving Smith with CPR techniques in front of thousands cheering for their beloved team's defensive player.

In a statement released shortly after the incident, Dallas Cowboys coach Jimmy Johnson expressed his regret and concern regarding this development while emphasizing that all possible measures would be taken to investigate what happened behind closed doors between players from both teams on yesterday evening at Mueller Stadium: "Anthony Smith's injury was unexpected as he has been performing well throughout the season, playing most of our defensive snaps. He is a talented player and we will take every precaution needed moving forward."

The Texans responded to Dallas Cowboys Coach Johnson with equal resolve when they called for an official investigation into how this incident occurred while expressing their condolences on behalf of all players involved in the match. "We are deeply saddened by yesterday's unfortunate events, which led to a fellow player being seriously injured," said Houston Texans coach Lamar Jackson speaking with reporters after practice today at NRG Stadium where they had just beaten Dallas Cowboys on Wednesday afternoon.

According to firsthand accounts and video footage obtained by CNN from eyewits inside the stadium, Austin-based linebacker Derek Taylor was seen attempting a tackle of Smith with his right arm as Johnson charged forward toward him carrying an elbow pad for extra protection after taking some hits during gameplay. As soon as he made contact and attempted to bring down Texas defensive lineman Anthony Smith who had the ball, both players were separated on impact leaving Taylor sprawled helplessly at midfield with his right arm still grasping around Smith's neck where they briefly clashed just before the tackle was completed.
