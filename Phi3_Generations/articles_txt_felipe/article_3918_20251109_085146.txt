Four major tech companies have announced a partnership to develop next-genereneration wireless charging technology expected to revolutionize how we charge our devices on the go. Apple Inc., Google LLC, Samsung Electronics Co., and Qualcomm Incorporated signed an agreement today in Silicon Valley with plans for commercialization by 2025 after extensive research conducted at their respective headquarters in California since last year's breakthrough announcement of a prototype wireless charging system.

The companies have dedicated years to the development, testing and refining this new technology which promises much faster charging times without compromising battery life or requiring any special hardware from consumer devices like coils currently used in existing induction-based systems. As part of today's announcement Apple CEO Tim Cook said: "Today marks a pivotal moment for all tech enthusiasts eager to see how wireless charging can evolve, and we are thrilled that these four industry leaders have come together with their unmatched expertise."

In addition to faster charging times at more locations simultaneously than current systems offer, this partnership plans on creating an open-source protocol allowing any smartphone or device manufacturer access. In the early testing phase where devices could be charged in seconds instead of minutes over a distance of up to 10 feet away from their power source using just standard electromagnetic fields - unlike traditional wired connections which require direct physical contact between chargers and cables, making them prone for damage or wear-and-tear.

Samsung spokesperson Kim Jungwoo said: "Our goal is to make wireless more convenient than ever before without compromising our consumers' beloved devices." He also added that the team hopes this new technology can help minimize electronic waste and lower ecological impact associated with daily charging habits.

Google senior engineer Daniel Kim stated during today’s press conference: "This is just one step forward towards a more sustainable future as we continue to improve our infrastructure for greener alternatives."  The development of this technology comes after years worth if not decades spent on making wireless charging possible in the first place - from initial patent filings back when they were all start-ups, research grants and millions invested into prototypes aimed at getting it just right.

Samsung began testing their latest prototype with employees last year after receiving a government grant for developing advanced technology solutions that aligns directly under President Biden's infrastructure plan targeting the expansion of 5G networks across urban centers nationwide by 2030. The companies believe this will create new opportunities in industries such as transportation, healthcare and retail where quick charging could enhance efficiency while minimizing interruptions caused when waiting for devices to power up during meetings or emergency situations on the go.

In closing thoughts about how soon consumers might see their favorite gadgets sport this new tech? Qualcomm CTO Donna Lam said, "As part of a multi-pronged approach towards integrating these next generation advancements into everyday lives for all who use them - users should start seeing the first wave available in select markets starting 2024." But before anyone gets too excited about discarding their current cables or chargers, Apple Inc. has a clarification: "Though this wireless revolution will bring convenience with no extra accessories required for compatible devices moving forward - we advise consumers to keep backup options available just in case until the market stabil
