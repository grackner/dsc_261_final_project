Seattle Seahawks' Russell Wilson delivers an impressive performance as he leads team to victory over the Los Angeles Rams in NFC Championship game at Lumen Field on Sunday night: By Luke Reader and Alex Kovackas, CNN Sports Network; Updated at 7:30 p end

SEATTLE (CNN) - Russell Wilson threw for a touchdown pass of nearly 98 yards as he helped the Seattle Seahawks come from behind to defeat Los Angeles Rams in their NFC Championship game on Sunday night. The win propels the team back into Super Bowl LIV with one more victory than last season, where they came agonizingly close but fell just short of hoisting up that much sought-after trophy for only the second time since 2013 (when Aaron Rodgers helped Green Bay defeat Seattle).

The NFC Championship game took place at Lumen Field in front of a packed crowd as both teams made their way to this point after impressive regular seasons, but it was Wilson's leadership that really stood out for the Seahawks. After taking over the team following Chris Carson’s trade with San Francisco 49ers last year and throwing his first pass in relief of a struggling Carson (which he threw accurately downfield to end Christian McCaffrey), Russell has been consistent, leading Seattle past divisional opponents Atlanta Falcons on Thanksgiving Day before dispatching the New York Giants at MetLife Stadium two weeks later.

The NFC Championship game arrived with Wilson back in action after suffering a concussion and taking time off last year - but not only did he return to full fitness, his performance this season has been nothing short of spectacular as well; leading Seattle past the 49ers on Monday Night Football before another blowout win at Arizona Cardinals earlier this week.

Wilson completed a stunning touchdown pass for nearly 100 yards against LA - but Wilson is far from finished when it comes to big plays and even bigger numbers with his impressive stats so far, as he threw five TD passes totaling almost two combined passing yards per attempt (92.3). Seattle has scored a whopping nine touchdowns on offense already in the postseason - not including their kick return game against NYGiants when they ran back 15 kicks for an average of nearly six points each; while Wilson’s arm and speed continue to make him difficult opponents, Rams linebacker Aldon Smith shared his take after a hard-fought battle in the fourth quarter with Seattle wide receiver DK Metcalf.

"Wilson was able to get out there when others couldn't," said Aaron Rodgers during an appearance on "Sunday Night Football." While he never met Wilson himself, as Rams are from Los Angeles while Seahawks play at home and in the NFC West division where both teams have a long history of playing one-another including two Super Bowls (in 2014 when Seattle won its first title defeating Patriots before winning again last season), Rodgers said it is Wilson's leadership that has helped propel him to success.

"He makes those throws, but he does so with a lot of confidence and energy," added former NFL quarterback Brad Johnson on SiriusXM radio following his retirement in 2016 after stints as starting QB for the Dallas Cowboys (and briefly at Minnesota Vikings before that) from '95
