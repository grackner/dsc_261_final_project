In an unprecedented medical milestone here in Boston this past weekend, Dr. Susan O'Malley led a team at Massachusetts General Hospital that successfully treated four patients with severe cases of COVID-19 using the experimental drug Vaxonil. The treatment protocol was deemed safe after rigorous clinical trials conducted over several months and has been approved for emergency use by local authorities.

"Todener," a 43-year-old construction worker from Dorchester, is breathing easier since being admitted to the hospital on March 15th with what was feared as an imminent death sentence due to his advanced case of COVID-19 pneumonia. "It's like I’ve been given a second chance at life," Tanner shared from his room, after completing several days in the intensive care unit (ICU).

The city had seen its fair share of grief throughout this pandemic with over 250 lives claimed by COVID-19 and another hundred people on ventilators fighting for every breath. However, Dr. O'Malley is optimistic about what these successful treatments represent moving forward: "This isn’t just a Boston success story; it could be the turning point in our national battle against this deadly virus."

The treatment involved administering low doses of Vaxonil through an intravenous drip and supplemental oxygen. Clinicians closely monitored patients' responses to ensure they didn’t experience common side effects like fever or nausea, which can be a concern with some COVID-19 treatments.

Dr. Jonathan Reeves from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), who collaborated on research related to Vaxonil but was not directly involved in these specific cases, expressed hope for similar results across other hospitals: "We're cautiously optimistic and look forward to replicating this success with larger studies."

Following the breakthroughs here at MGH, health officials are already considering how they can expand accessibility of Vaxonil. The Massachusetts Department of Public Health is working on protocols for broader distribution while ensuring compliance with federal guidelines and maintaining safety standards within hospitals treating COVID-19 patients across the state.

For now, families like Tanner's are just starting to feel a sense of relief at what his recovery means: "We didn’t think he would make it through this," said Johnathan O'Malley, Tanner's brother who had been by his bedside for several days during the critical period.

The Boston community has rallied around these triumphant moments in medicine with pride and a collective breath of optimism as more successes are documented daily within city hospitals treating COVID-19 patients. The future looks brighter, one patient at a time.
