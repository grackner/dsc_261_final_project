CNN – An unconventional approach to strengthening relationships may now have scientific backing: a new study led by psychologist Dr. Emily Tran suggests that shared physical activities can enhance emotional bonds between couples, particularly during times of stress or distance due to work commitments like long-haul flights (Januan Date).

"It's fascinating how exercise and movement seem not only beneficial for our health but also pivotal in reinforcing the intimacy among partners," stated Dr. Tran, who conducted her research over six months with 20 couples from various demographic backgrounds across three cities: New York City (USA), Paris (France), and Sydney (Australia).

The study focused on both genders engaging in physical activities that they usually do not share outside of the household setting. Activities included indoor cycling, yoga sessions led by instructors with expertise specifically for pairs or small groups, as well as structured hikes using guided walking apps tailored to encourage conversations about personal experiences and emotions while moving through nature trails.

"I've never felt closer to my husband after our weekly yoga classes," remarked one participant from the New York cohort during an interview on a Sunday afternoon, shortly following their session held at Manhattan Wellness Studio last Thursday morning (March 30). "It forces us to be vulnerable and really present with each other."

Participants reported that activities helped them build trust by creating moments of shared success or overcoming challenges together. Dr. Tran observed, “The physical exertion coupled with mindful communication seems to enhance the quality of their relationship.” She also found an increase in expressions of empathy and understanding within couples when compared to a control group not engaging in these activities (data collected through bi-weekly surveys).

"As much as exercise is good for physical health, it's equally beneficial mentally. It can be surprising how working up a sweat or doing some simple movements together helps us connect on an emotional level," commented Dr. Tran about the findings during her presentation at The Healthy Relationship Conference held last week in Paris (April 12).

The research indicates that couples who incorporated movement and exercise into their routines reported a significant boost in relationship satisfaction, as noted by both partners across different continents. "This is about quality time together," said Dr. Tran when reflecting on the study's implications for long-distance relationships or those with hectic work schedules like flight crews (April 14). “Physical activity can be a form of communication and intimacy that sometimes words alone cannot achieve.”

Experts suggest incorporating these findings into relationship counseling practices, which could lead to the development of exercise-based programs aimed at strengthening bonds. Dr. Tran's study might also inspire further research exploring various forms and intensities of shared physical activities that resonate with couples across different lifestyles (June 18).

"Our findings suggest a need to explore the untapped potential of exercise as part of relationship maintenance, particularly for those who experience difficulty in finding time together due to demanding jobs like pilots or flight attendants," concluded Dr. Tran after her team's study wraps up next month (July 25).
