**India's Climate Pledge: Ambitious Plan Aims for Net Zero by 2decade Endline in Effort to Combat Global Warming**

New Delhi — India is stepping up its fight against climate change, setting an ambitious target of achieving net-zero carbon emissions no later than the end of the next decade. The Indian government announced this landmark goal as part of a comprehensive strategy to reduce greenhouse gas output and invest in sustainable technologies while maintaining economic growth trajectories that benefit its population, particularly those living below the poverty line.

The commitment was made during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's address at COP26 in Glasgow last month where he emphasized India’s readiness to take on climate action measures with a firm yet delicate approach towards international cooperation and respect for its developmental goals, as stated: "Our pledge is born out of our commitment not only to ourselves but also the generations that come after us."

This historic announcement comes amid growing concerns over India's contribution to global carbon emissions due to rapid industrialization. The South Asian nation has traditionally been seen grappling with pollution at its core, yet strides towards a greener economy have marked recent years under the leadership of Modi and his administration.

India’s chief economic advisor Sanjeev Sikka commented on the announcement in Glasgow saying that India “aspires to be among leading economies committed not only for our present generations but also those who come after us.” The nation plans a comprehensive revamp of its energy sector, increasing renewable sources and phasing out reliance on fossil fuels.

Asia's largest democracy has set clear targets — reducing the carbon intensity (emissions per unit of GDP) by 33%-35% from 2005 levels by FY26, followed by net zero emissions in less than a decade if necessary to meet its pledges. The government is investing heavily into solar and wind power projects with the goal for renewable sources comprising more than half of India's energy mix within this ambitious timeline.

Amit Bhatt, an environmental scientist at Mumbai University stated that “India’s proactive stance towards climate action has sent a powerful message worldwide – progress on decarbonization is achievable with vision and determination.” 

However questions persist regarding the viability of such sweeping reforms. Environmentalists urged caution, saying they must go hand-in-hand with effective policy implementation while ensuring that socioeconomic disparities don't get overlooked in this transition to a low carbon economy: “India’s pledge is commendable but it also raises concerns about whether the plan will be practical or just remain as an aspirational goal.”

Reactions from developed countries were varied, with some expressing optimism and urging collaboration on climate mitigation measures while others remained skeptical due to India's historical contribution to global carbon emissions. A spokesperson for the United Nations commented “We believe this bold move by a developing country sets an example of strong leadership in addressing challenges posed by environmental change.”

The Indian government is keen on garnering international assistance through financial and technological support from developed nations to meet their ambitious target. Meanwhile, experts advise continued investment into research
