Gregory Allen led North Carolina State University's rally to a dominant victory over NC A&T with just under two minutes left in their regular season game on Saturday at the Raleigh Campus of Wallace Woolcock Stadium, marking an unprecedented win for CSU. This 28-7 final score came after years without breaking past this point and is causing significant shifts within college football circles as it appears to have challenged traditional beliefs about team strength in the ACC's North Division, which includes both NC State University (NC) and NC A&T State University.

"This game just goes to show that there are untapped potential teams capable of delivering incredible performances when given a fair chance," remarked Coach Smith at CSU during post-game discussions on Friday evening as he addressed his team's unexpected success, which seemed improbable before the first whistle sounded.

The Tar Heel football program had been struggling for years to break NC State University’s 21–year reign of dominance over their former rival A&T in the regular season finale game – a statistic that held great significance as it was traditionally thought among fans and experts alike, with no small portion within the university's athletic department believing such an upset to be impossible.

This Saturday’s match on Wallace Woolcock Stadium’s field saw NC State University taking a 14-0 lead into halftime when quarterback Taylor Green dashed forward for his first career touchdown pass, and several key players – including running back Mark Brown and linebacker Chris Patterson - followed suit with impressive stats throughout the game.

But after enduring an intense half hour of constant pressure from North Carolina State University's offensive squadron led by All-ACC quarterback Taylor Green, head coach Bob Wallace had to resort to a risky strategy involving his backup QB - sophomore Jake Wilson. 

"I wasn’t expecting this kind of aggression after just four games into the season," said Wallace about CSU's sudden shift in playing style early on Saturday afternoon, but he admitted that adjusting tactics could prove crucial for NC A&T to make a comeback before time expired.

However, Jake Wilson’s decision-making skills weren’t enough to stop the run and his team trailed 14–7 with only two minutes left in regulation when cornerback Derek Jackson stepped up after another touchdown by NC State University's quarterback Taylor Green - a move that was met with stunned silence from A&T supporters on both sides of the field.

"This is not how we imagined our season would end, but sometimes you get those unexpected moments in life where all your hard work pays off," said Derek Jackson after his touchdown catch helped NC State University maintain a comfortable lead going into overtime. 

But just as it seemed CSU's winning streak had solidified when quarterback Jake Wilson threw an interception during the first drive of Overtime, head coach Bob Wallace quickly rallied around by pulling off a successful onside kick to start NC A&T’s comeback attempt - something they hadn’t managed since 2018.
