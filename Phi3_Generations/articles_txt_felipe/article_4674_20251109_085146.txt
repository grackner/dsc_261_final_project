Dylan Matthews was found guilty of shoplifting designer handbags from a luxury fashion boutique in New York City yesterday evening. The defendant's age and the nature of his misdemeanor have prompted discussions on juvenile justice reform, as he turned 17 years old last month but is still considered legally responsible for all actions during that year.

New York – Dylan Matthews’ reputation took a hit when city authorities caught him red-handed at Prestige Boutique in Manhattan yesterday evening after multiple customers reported suspicious behavior near the accessories section, where teenagers are often seen trying on handbags for size. According to his lawyer, Dylan is an avid fashion enthusiast who aspires to start a clothing line of his own one day and has been saving money from part-time jobs at local cafes since the age of 14 with that dream in mind.

At just shy of adulthinity, Dylan's actions could have easily resulted in an even more serious charge as New York City is known for its stringent laws against such acts – but it turned out his misdemeanor stemmed from a desire to stay fashionable among friends and family. The 17-year-old was arrested after he slipped three handbags worth $80 each into the hem of his backpack before leaving the store, actions that caused quite an uproar within the boutique's staff who were unaware until their shopkeeper came forward to testify about seeing Dylan acting unusually for a teenager.

CNN New York has reached out to Matthews and representatives from Prestige Boutique, along with local juvenile justice officials in the city's Fashion District area; all parties declined comment at this time. Official statements indicate that Dylan will now face a shoplifting charge for his misdemeanor but could potentially be eligible to attend diversion programs instead of facing jail time, due to New York City’s progressive approach towards juvenile crimes and rehabilitation efforts in the fashion industry.

The Matthews family says they were unaware Dylan had committed shoplifting until his arrest came as a shock – though many are familiar with stories of teenagers trying on clothes for fun or to impress someone nearby, New Yorkers have been known lately due their city's reputation and costly prices. "I am disappointed in him," said Dylan’s mother Elizabeth Matthews about her son who just got his first part-time job at a local café last summer where he worked with hopes to save up enough for a small business one day, per the New York Times' profile of young entrepreneurial aspirations in teens.

Juvenile justice officials and prosecutors have since met privately regarding Dylan’s misdemeanor case but declined comment on whether he could face harsher penalties due to his age, citing policy guidelines meant for juveniles charged with felonies. "As long as it is clear that there was no intention or malice in the act – only a desire to stay fashionable," said one prosecutor when asked about Dylan's actions which were first reported last night by local reporters on their social media accounts, according to Reuters’ reports.
