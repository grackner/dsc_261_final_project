A powerful typhoon has made landfall in Japan's Saitama Prefecture this weekend with wind speeds reaching up to 150 kilometers per hour and heavy rainfall resulting in significant flooding, according to the Meteorological Agency of Japan. The super typhoon named "Kuro" hit on Saturday evening local time around the city of Kashiwane which lies about 43 miles southeast of Tokyo.

Authorities have issued a state of emergency for several towns and cities in Saitama Prefecture, including Fujimi City, Higashi-kuhara City, Ogose Town, Urawa Ward, Takasu Village, Shiki Municipality, Gyogikyo Village, Tsukidate Village, Kaijou Village, Oizumi District and Iwatsuki Ward. Over 40 evacuation centers have been opened across these areas to shelter affected residents who are being urged not leave their homes until the storm passes is said by Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike in an emergency statement broadcast on Sunday morning local time: "I ask for your patience and cooperation as we face this difficult situation together."

"This was one of those rare, extremely powerful typhoons that directly hit populated areas," stated meteorologist Akira Suzuki with the Meteorological Agency. He added, “With maximum sustained winds up to 150 km/h and torrential rains expected overnight until Monday morning local time.”

According to Kyodo News Service in Tokyo, residents are bracing for heavy rain that is forecast to last from Sunday evening till early Tuesday. Authorities have warned of potential flash flooding resulting as a consequence with rivers near overflow levels seen before during severe weather events earlier this year when at least three people lost their lives due to drowning after being caught in swift-moving waters while fishing on Lake Ashida, about 75 miles northeast from Tokyo.

"I understand the gravity of what is happening and I urge everyone please follow all instructions issued by authorities," Mayor Hiroshi Nishiyama said to a group of concerned citizens gathered in Kashiwane's city hall on Sunday afternoon local time, emphasizing how important it was for people not to panic.

Experts say that although the storm has now left Japan and moved over China bringing rain there as well, they warn another wave could be headed towards Korea next weekend causing more potential disruption in these already challenging times due to COVID-19 restrictions on gatherings amid flood warnings issued by South Korean authorities.

The Meteorological Agency continues to closely monitor this developing weather situation and provides regular updates via their official website, social media platforms like Twitter @MetOfficeJapan for those seeking immediate information about the storm’s progress in Japan or further east towards China as well ongoing relief efforts being made across these affected areas by both national government authorities along with local communities themselves.
