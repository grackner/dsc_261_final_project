A massive earthquake struck Iraq on Saturday morning near Baghdad with a preliminary magnitude of 6.4 before dawn and again at around midday according to the U.S.-based EarthScope network. The tremors were felt across several provinces, including Kirkuk in Nineveh Governorate; Tuz Khurmatish District in Saladin Province near Baghdad International Airport (BKI); Falluja and Hit City located within Anbar Province's territorial bounds of Western Euphrates River Valley. The epicenter was identified to be approximately 50 kilometers from Kirkuk, while the secondary earthquake hit about 120 kilometers southeast near BKI.

The Iraqi Civil Defense and Relief Organization reported multiple injuries with casualties including children in Tuz Khurmatish District as of Sunday afternoon; however, confirmed fatalities remained at zero for the day following Friday's temblor which saw 7 deaths across four provinces according to initial estimates. Rescue teams are continuing efforts through early Monday morning searching under collapsed structures and debris in all affected regions with assistance from international aid agencies such as Red Cross, while local officials assure that shelters have been set up for displaced families at secure locations away from damaged buildings.

A seismologist speaking to BBC Arabic News Channel mentioned the likelihood of aftershocks and expressed caution advising people in tremor-affected areas on precautions including remaining indoclined during possible future shock waves; a statement which echoed advice issued by local authorities earlier today, reinforcing that all residents should not evacuate but stay put until further notice.

Iraq's Ministry of Health announced their hospitals are at full capacity treating those injured from the earthquake along with ongoing seasonal illnesses and urged anyone in need to visit one nearby instead while city officials stated that they will re-evaluate shelter needs every 48 hours as many displaced families continue seeking safe accommodation outside of Baghdad.

"It's a terrible situation for everyone affected but we are working hard together with all Iraqi citizens and international partners to bring this crisis under control", said Interior Minister Ahmed Al-Saadi in press conference yesterday evening highlighting that the emergency response operation is now coordinated between federal, provincial governments as well as community councils.

In Kirkuk city itself where damage has been reported at numerous public buildings and homes due to their age being a contributing factor alongside structural deterioration over time with many not meeting current building codes he assured residents that repairs were already underway supported by the central government while local businesses have begun assisting relief efforts through fundraising drives, supply donations and offering employment opportunities for those displaced within their own cityscape.

Meanwhile in Tuz Khurmatish District near Baghdad International Airport where most of reported damages took place officials from Iraqi Security Forces confirmed that security remains tight while military escort convoys continue carrying relief supplies into the hardest hit areas; additionally several NGO's including UNICEF have begun setting up temporary educational camps for children who lost access to schooling due to earthquake disru0ptions with volunteer teachers providing lessons on subjects such as science, history and language arts from makeshift classrooms in safe locations.
