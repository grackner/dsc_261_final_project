In a bustling metropolis known for its vibrant street life and rich cultural heritage lies Bali's newest attraction: The Cultural Experience Village. Set to open on August 15, the village offers visitors an immersive journey into Indonesian traditions with interactive workshops in traditional dance, music, batik painting, culinary delights like Balinese cuisine and Ayam Penyet (chicken steamed under banana leaves), as well as insights on local customs.

Developed by a team of skilled artisans led by 65-year-old Nyoman Sarih, the village will also feature handcraft stores where visitors can purchase souvenirs to remember their experience or buy unique Balinese products made locally and sustainably for home delivery globally. With this latest addition from Bali’s tourism offerings since it started gaining popularity in 2018 as a top-tourist destination, officials predict the Cultural Experience Village could attract up to an additional 50,000 visitors annually by its first anniversary of operations.

“We believe this village will appeal not only because people want authentic experiences but also due to our increasingly eco-conscious travelers who appreciate learning about sustainable practices,” said I Gusti Bagus Putra, Director General for Culture at the Indonesian Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy. “Our artisans have worked tirelessly on this project with a focus not just on showcasing their talents but also sharing knowledge.”

The 10-acre space has been transformed into an enchanting village complete with traditional thatched huts called Tumpangan and intricately designed structures made of bamboo, which are both visually captivating and symbolically significant in Balinese culture. The location on the Nusa Dua peninsula was carefully chosen for its natural beauty as well as being accessible from Denpasar airport through a short scenic drive or train ride along Route 62A via Garuda Wisnu Kencana National Park, which is just five kilometers away and offers breathtaking views of Mount Batur.

Visitors can participate in workshops that will be led by experienced Balinese artisans who have mastered their respective crafts for generations; these sessions range from dance lessons taught on Sundays to batik painting courses throughout the week, each designed as an interactive experience where guests are encouraged to try out new skills under expert guidance. Additionally, there is a daily cooking class in which visitors can learn how to prepare authentic Balinese dishes such as Nasi Padang or Sate Ayam that will be enjoyed together with locals at the communal tables inside village buildings and on nearby beachfront terraces overlooking crystal-clear waters of Teluk Dalat.

Sustainability is a key priority for this venture, where visitors are encouraged to bring reusable containers or purchase eco-friendly souvenirs from locally owned stores within the village premises – many products like handcrafted jewelry and batik fabrics will even come with information about their artisans' sustainable practices.

“It is our mission here at Cultural Experience Village to not only share Balinese culture but also contribute towards responsible tourism,” said Nyoman Sarih, owner of the village who previously managed several local hotels before founding this new venture with his son Agus and
