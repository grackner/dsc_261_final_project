Topic: Style - Luxury

In a luxurious new development opening in Beverly Hills this month, one of California's most extravagant and modern high-end resorts is set to become the go-to destination for Hollywood elites seeking opulent relaxation amidst their busy schedules. The Riviera Grandee Luxury Resort & Spa unveiled its doors on March 1, with an estimated value exceeding $250 million and features that include a bespoenzed penthouse suite offering panoramic ocean views as well as private helipad access for convenience of arrival.

"The Riviera Grandee is not just another luxury resort; it's the embodiment of haute couture hospitality," said renowned designer Vanessa DeLano, whose vision transformed a simple hotel concept into an extravagant dreamland where style meets serenity." Her team designed custom-made furniture and interiors using rare materials from around the world.

CNN has learned that within this secluded oasis lies multiple swimming pools adorned with crystal chandeliers, a private beach complete with designer cabanas for guests to enjoy their sunbathing sessions uninterrupted by fellow holidaymakers. 

Elaine Kensington's father recently passed away without leaving any inheritance and now finds himself facing an immense tax burden as he navigates through estate planning, reports the Los Angeles Times on March 30th, adding to his emotional distress during a difficult time for her family. "It is unfortunate that I am in this position," said Kensington's father Michael Smith outside with his attorney Mr. James Connor who explained further:

"We are working through the California estate tax implications, and while there have been some assets to consider beyond simple liquid funds, our focus remains on providing comfort for my daughter during a challenging period." The high-profile family previously enjoyed an affluent lifestyle with properties around Beverly Hills but has since experienced significant changes.

In addition to the Riviera Grandee's allure and opulence, its design also prioritizes sustainability without compromising on luxury; solar panels cover much of the exterior roof area while an in-house organic farm supplies some meals at Michelin-starred restaurants. "It is a delicate balance to maintain eco-consciousness and indulgence within such lavish surroundings," shared sustainability expert Dr. Helen Fisher during her visit last week, adding:

"Despite the grandeur of Riviera Grandee Luxury Resort & Spa's setting in California, it is refreshing to see that luxury can also harmonize with environmental responsibility."
