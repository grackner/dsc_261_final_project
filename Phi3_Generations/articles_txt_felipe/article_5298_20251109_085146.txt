It was a match to remember – when Newcastle United faced off against Chelsea FC in St James' Park last Saturday evening for their Premier League clash. With stakes at fever pitch and an audience of over ten thousand eager onlookers, the anticipation grew as both teams took possession nearer midfield with just under 60 minutes to play remaining. Newcastle initiated a counter-attack after winning back possession around seven minutes in but it was not until three full quarters had passed that either side began scoring goals.

Unexpectedly, Chelsea's goalkeeper – Alex McCarthy - found himself having to deal with an onrushing striker who dribbled towards him before curling the ball into the net from close range after 75 minutes of play had passed and this was Newcastle United’s fourth consecutive loss for the season.

"It' endangered our lead," Chelsea Coach Antonio Conte said, while he fielded reporters outside St James', his voice tinged with a sense of disbelief at how things turned out so rapidly after they dominated possession throughout most of half-time and beyond. He added that the referees should have cautioned them against such reckless play from Newcastle's forward line, but said nothing about what happened immediately before the goal was scored as he walked off with his players towards their dressing room where there were mixed expressions on faces in full blackout mode and half mask.

Newcastle coach Steve Bruce tried to downplay McCarthy’s mistake during a press conference later that night while addressing reporters outside, insisting the team hadn't done anything wrong but conceded they should have kept their discipline better throughout tonight's game especially after gaining possession nearer end-line as Chelsea sought revenge for last weekend’s defeat at Stamford Bridge.

"We must accept responsibility," Bruce acknowledged, looking solemnly into the eyes of his team members seated behind him while he held up a sheet detailing match statistics which included Newcastle's total shots made – 12th most in league history and goal contribution ranking amongst their lowest since records began being kept more than three decades ago. “We lost our discipline as soon we got into possession," Bruce admitted, adding that his team will focus on this during training next week after failing to capitalize effectively when able for the first time back at home ground in two months against Everton last Saturday evening which also ended with defeat 2-1 losing goalkeeper Jordan Pickford and midfielder Tiedey Smith - Newcastle's top scorer since signing from Premier League giants, Tottenham Hotspur earlier this season.

"We were too negative tonight," Bruce continued reflecting on the loss of two important players during halftime break after Everton scored twice within eight minutes and said his team would need all hands on deck for upcoming fixtures against Arsenal who are looking to end a five-match winless run in home matches but will still head into Wednesday's clash with Liverpool at Anfield - where they hope their first match back after losing the league title last May by just four points – having already won three consecutive Premier League encounters against them this season.

A Chelsea official, speaking to reporters outside St James’ Park on Friday morning before kick-off for next Saturday's fixture at home versus Tottenham Hotspur commented that "The game was incredibly compet
