A renowned Michelin-starred restaurant in New York City has been temporarily closed due to a rare and complex food poisoning outbreak traced back to their kitchen practices on March 15th, reports CNN Food Affairs correspondent Jennifer Smith. The upscale establishment "La Belle Vie," known for its exquisite French cuisine and intimate dining atmosphere, announced the closure after three guests were rushed to urgent care with severe symptoms of food poisoning early Monday morning local time.

The health department has launched an immediate investigation following reports that a meal served at "La Belle Vie" may be linked to these illnesses involving multiple parties including diners, kitchen staff, and chefs. Symptoms reported include nausea, vomiting, severe cramps, diarrhea lasting for days rather than hours as seen in most foodborne diseases of this kind—which is unusual because the culprit seems to be a unique strain identified by local health officials not commonly encountered in New York.

Chef André Leblanc expressed shock over the situation saying, "We pride ourselves on using only fresh and locally sourced ingredients," adding that they had no idea how such contaminants could have entered their kitchen: "[The outbreak] is a grave concern for us—it undermines everything we stand for."

According to the New York City Health Commissioner Dr. Susan Clarke, "We've seen this kind of strain before in other states and countries where food was sourced from abroad," emphasizing that it appears local ingredients were responsible but require extensive testing to confirm as a cause for concern: "[Local produce] is something we trust wholeheartedly; our focus now turns towards immediate solutions."

As the investigation proceeds, "La Belle Vie" has temporarily shut its doors and pledged cooperation with authorities. The city's Department of Health issued an advisory statement reminding residents to exercise caution when eating out while not implying blame on any specific establishment or industry sector: "With food safety concerns always present, we urge all patrons here in New York City to remain vigilant and report anything suspicious."

Meanwhile at the scene of this unusual event were concerned local diners who had eaten there over the weekend. Emma Thompson shared her experience saying it was a "terrible surprise" when she started feeling ill late Sunday night, while Alex Rodriguez admitted to not knowing where his sudden sickness came from: "[I thought] I just ate too much or something...it's pretty scary."

The outbreak prompted health officials and restaurant owners alike into action as they work hard towards identifying the root cause. In an effort to prevent future occurrences, "La Belle Vie" will undergo rigorous food safety inspections in addition to reviewing their kitchen staff's compliance with city regulations: "[We want] our guests and employees back safe at La Belle Vie."

The case serves as a timely reminder for the public about maintaining mindful practices when consuming outside establishments, particularly amid heightened health concerns across various industries globally. For now, "La Belle Vie" continues to await test results while continuously offering discounts and freebies on local farm-fresh produce at nearby markets as a gesture of goodwill: "[Our customers' wellbeing] is our top priority."
