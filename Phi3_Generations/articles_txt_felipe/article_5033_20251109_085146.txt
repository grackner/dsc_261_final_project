Athletes from various disciplines have been rallying around a common goal: to make it back home safely in time for their respective family celebrations during this year's Olympic Games in Tokyo. With less than two weeks remaining until the closing ceremony, organizers are implementing additional measures and procedures to ensure that every participant can return promptly post-competition without further disruinating travel plans due to unforeseen delays or complications inherent within large scale events like these international spectacles.

Amidst an already congested global transportation network, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government has recently announced a special Olympic Transport Service (OTS) that will cater exclusively to athletes and support staff returning from abroad between August 8-24th—the duration of the Games in Japan's capital. Accordingly, this service offers priority boarding on international flights operated by All Nippon Airways, which also owns domestic airline counterparts like Jetstar Alps and Vanilla.

"We are determined to ensure every athlete has a seamless journey back home after they've given their all in the Games," says Toshihiro Fukushima, Tokyo Olympic Organizing Committee spokesperson. "With our enhanced transportation service tailored for athletes and support staff returning from abroad during these final days of competition at this incredible global event."

The OTS will be available to participants who depart the country by air on any given day within their flight window back home, with priority allocation based primarily upon an athlete's competitive schedule. For example, a sprinter participating in preliminary heats during early August would get prioritized return flights as compared to those finishing later and having more time before departure deadlines come due on the closing day of competition —August 12th—for all nations across various sports disciplines represented at this summer's Olympics.

Apart from special transport arrangements, local hotels in Tokyo are also working closely with tourism boards to create "safe havens" where athletes can relax and unwind before heading back home for the festivities that await them upon return stateside or across continents worldwide after these Games have concluded on August 12th.

In an interview, former Olympic gold medalist runner Kenji Takahashi reveals how grateful he is to see such dedicated support coming from organizers and fellow athletes alike: "To be able to compete here in Tokyo was a dream come true for me as I never got the chance to participate at these Games before. Seeing so much love, care being poured into making everyone's experience memorable is incredibly touching."

Additionally, some athletes who might have difficulty finding flights or securing tickets due to overbookings or other unavoidable circumstances are eligible for free hotel stays until they can secure their next flight. This measure has been put forth by a coalition of hotels and the Tokyo Metropolitan Government as part of an effort towards ensuring that no participant is left stranded amidst Japan's historic, yet hectic summer event period —the year 2021 Olympics taking place in full glory here on this continent-spanning city.

Furthermore, international travel agencies based within the Japanese capital are ramping up their services with more resources being allocated towards accommodating last minute bookings by athletes and officials alike seeking to make it back home before August 12th—the
