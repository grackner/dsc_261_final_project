Wednesday's blizzard in New York forced major airlines to cancel hundreds of flights as temperatures dropped below freezing and visibility plummeted across the city. According to reports from NYPD, overnight flight cancellations reached nearly 500 into Thursday morning due to severe weather conditions impacting JFK Airport in Queens, LaGuardia Airport on Manhattan's Roosevelt Island, as well as smaller regional airports throughout the state.

"The extreme winter storm has caused significant disruption and delays for thousands of travelers," said Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) spokespincess Andrea Broderick during an interview with WPIX-TV Wednesday night, adding that snow removal crews were working tirelessly to restore normal operations.

The MTA also announced it would be extending bus and subway services until at least 2 a.m., while some local roads may not reopen for several hours longer after plows clear the streets on Thursday mornings, reports Gothamist New York Daily News. The storm brought up to two feet of snow in parts of Queens late Tuesday night and early Wednesday morning as strong wind gusts pushed it towards Manhattan before melting off into Upper East Side's Central Park lake at around 4 a.m., reports NBCNewYork Local News via NY1.

By Thursday afternoon, more than half of the canceled flights had already been taken off from runways and terminal gates in preparation for Tuesday night snowstorm relief efforts which saw citywide plowing operations extend into Friday morning due to continued poor weather conditions. New York Governor Kathy Hochul tweeted that "New Yorkers have the spirit, but Mother Nature will always win," urging residents to stay home and make alternate travel plans if necessary for safety reasons ahead of this weekend's holiday season celebrations which usually see thousands flocking into city centers across New York.

Emergency officials in Queens said Tuesday evening they had received reports from multiple motorists stranded on the streets with their cars trapped under heavy snow drifts since 2 a.m., as first responders used chains and salt trucks to reach them safely, Fox5 New York News reported Wednesday afternoon at around noon ET time when temperatures had dropped down even further by early Thursday morning with wind gust speeds exceeding 30 mph in some areas of Queens.

"It's very concerning," said NYPD spokesperson Sgt. John McGlynn during an interview today, adding that many travelers have already begun returning home or finding alternative transportation options after overnight flight cancellations reached their peak this morning at JFK Airport and LaGuardia which were still in recovery mode throughout Thursday as temperatures hovered around 20° F (-6° C) with snow forecasted for late evening on Wednesday night before melting off into the Hudson River overnight. "We ask travelers who had their plans disrupted by this storm to exercise caution when venturing outside and make sure they have reliable means of transportation if needed," he said, advising commuters in New York City's five boroughs not wait for buses or subways but instead take a taxi into the city after reaching home safely.

Travel experts warn that it will be at least two more days
