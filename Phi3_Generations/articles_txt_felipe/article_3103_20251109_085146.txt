Washington State University and Oregon State University will face off in a highly anticipated Pac-12 championship game tomorrow night at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas. The matchup pits the Cougars from Pullman against the Beavers of Corvallis, with both teams finishing their regular seasons without losses and holding top 20 rankings nationally according to USChampionshipReporting's power index (USCP).

Jake Smith has been a standout player for Washington State since he transferred from Colorado this past spring. The senior wide receiver had just shy of six touchdown catches as the Cougars clinched outright first place in their division under second-year coach Chris Petersen, whose players also claimed victory at Saturday's Las Vegas Bowl against Michigan State with a hard-fought 37–24 win.

"I think we just really stepped up when it counted the most," Smith told reporthis week after scoring two touchdowns in that game as well, which tied his career high and cemented him into starting for Petersen next season alongside fellow senior receiver Tyler Laflamme who also had seven catches during this run.

Oregon State enters the night with their own impressive stature - having won eight of its last 10 regular seasons under fifth-year coach Mike Riley, and ranking ninth in the nation overall (USCP). This team has seen a lot as well overcoming several challenges throughout this year. Sophomore running back Jaxson Smith broke his right femur during training camp on September 9 but returned just two months later to win both the Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week and Freshman All-America honors for his season's accomplishments.

"He is a kid who works extremely hard, never gives up, always has something positive to say about himself," Riley said in September after Jaxson made an instant impact as part of Oregon State University’s special teams squad by tying the NCAA record with five touchback returns during his first 10 games played.

"The way we've been playing this year, it just feels like a different ballgame." - Coach Mike Riley on USC football team (USCP) after they went undefeated in conference play at Oregon State University last season before falling to Cal-Berkeley 30–27.

"It’s amazing what these young men are capable of when given the right support," remarked Dr. Patricia Hernandez, a psychologist specializing in sports performance who recently conducted workshops with both teams during training camps this season to improve mental toughness and focus on game day situations - an effort praised by Petersen as "invaluable."

"I think we just really stepped up when it counted the most," Jake Smith, senior wide receiver for Washington State (USCP) told reporters after scoring two touchdowns in Saturday's Las Vegas Bowl against Michigan State.  

The game will kick off at 7:05 p.m. Eastern time this evening before streaming online on ESPN and CBSSN, with the final score expected to be broadcast live nationally via NFL Network after normal TV coverage concludes around midnight local start in Las Vegas following commercial breaks; an event which sees both schools compete annually for decades now as rivalry games.
