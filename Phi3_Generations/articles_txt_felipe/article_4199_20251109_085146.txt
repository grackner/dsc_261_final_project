A major winter storm battering East Coast states is projected to last through next weekend with record snowfall expected in parts of New York and Pennsylvania on Thursday night into Friday morning (February 13-14). As temperatures plummet, residents across the region are digging out after historic blizzards that have already left several dead.

New weather models suggest this storm could deliver as much as a foot of snow in some areas, particularly upstate New York and Northethy Pennsylvania where cities like Binghamton are bracing for major impacts on transportation, power, and local infrastructure by the time it hits peak strength late Thursday night into Friday morning.

"I've never seen anything quite as bad since I moved here 30 years ago," said John Harris, a resident of Binghamton who spent Wednesday shoveling snow outside his home to keep sidewalks and driveways clear for family members coming over from out-of-state. "My wife’s brother's house is about an hour away in New Jersey where it's already hit really hard, but he told us we need to prepare even more because they expect a lot of snowfall."

The National Weather Service warns that this storm could dump as much as 2 feet near the Lake Ontario shoreline and along parts of Route 17. As these blizzard warnings continue across Pennsylvania, New York's emergency services are working tirelessly to keep people safe amid dangerous conditions on roads and highways while officials have issued travel advisories urging residents not to drive at all if possible or carry out only essential trips with full awareness of the dangers.

Dr. Emily Thompson, an atmospheric science professor at Penn State University who has studied extreme weather events for over two decades says: "It's concerning how much snow we could see accumulating in these parts because it’s not just about clearing roads but also understanding the environmental impact of heavy snows. The more frequent and intense winter storms are indicative that our climate is changing."

The historic 2017-2018 blizzard, known as "Storm Juno," serves a sober reminder to prepare for such events in years ahead; while Storm Emma hitting the UK last year highlighted how quickly weather patterns can shift. According to Dr. Thompson's research, this current winter storm is not an isolated event but rather part of broader climate change trends impacting East Coast states and beyond: "Increased evaporation due to warmer temperatures will bring more moisture into the atmosphere for snowfall during colder weather spells – making events like these even heavier."

While many residents are stockpiling supplies, including essentials such as food items that can be prepared without heat and fresh water sources in case of power outages which have already left thousands without electricity across several states since last weekend's blizzard; the emergency services teams remain on high alert for any potential storm-related injuries while working around the clock to keep snow removal efforts underway.

"Our top priority is keeping people safe and ensuring their basic needs are met," said New York State Homeland Security Commissioner Mark Levine during a press conference yesterday afternoon, adding that "We have established special winter weather centers throughout affected areas where citizens can seek assistance if necessary."
