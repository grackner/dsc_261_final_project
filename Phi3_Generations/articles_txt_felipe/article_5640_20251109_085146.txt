Bali's Balinese Culture Festival to Include New Sustainable Makeup Line

In an exciting development for beauty enthusiasts and environmentally conscious tourists alike, Bali is set to host a grand celebration of traditional style alongside the introduction of Asia's first sustainable makeup line at this year’sel Style - Beauty Festival. The festival will take place in Ubud, on April 20-22, drawing thousands from across Indonesia and beyond as they experience authentic Balinese culture while keeping their beauty routines eco-friendly.

The collaboration between leading Bali makeup artist Ayu Sarihasti and renowned local entrepreneur Dewa Indra brings the sustainable cosmetic line to life, with a focus on using organic ingredients sourced from within Indonesia’s rich biodiversity. "We're thrilled about this partnership," Ayu Sarihasti said in an interview last weekend at Ubud Monkey Forest cafe where she had showcased her makeup skills to a small group of interested customers and bloggers, which included senior reporter I Made Bambang Adrian.

Ayu emphasized the dual focus on tradition and innovation; sustainable materials have been incorporated into classic Balinese beauty rituals as part of this initiative that has received support from local artisans who are well-known for their intricate handicrafts in Ubud's marketplace.

Dewa Indra, whose family owns a chain of environmentally friendly spas on the island since 1982, commented, "By working with Ayu Sarihasti and local artisans like her father Dewa Bagus Nira Pratama to create this sustainable line, we hope not only to promote Balinese culture but also bring forward a message of ecological responsibility."

Eco-friendly packaging will be utilized alongside the organic ingredients in their products. Visitors at Ubud's Art Market heard Ayu explain that every element from containers made by Bali craftspeople to local flowers used for decorative purposes, and natural scents derived through traditional Balinese methods form a cohesive ethos of sustainability within beauty practices here on the island known as Kecakra.

"Our line is inspired by our culture's connection with nature," Ayu shared during her demonstration at last month’s ‘Balinese Fashion Week.’ "The way we look and feel good should always be in harmony with what Mother Earth provides, so using natural ingredients feels right to me."

Attendees can expect a variety of makeup looks ranging from minimalist face mask application inspired by Balinese mud facials or the more elaborate traditional Kecak ritual body painting. Workshops and panels will also provide insights into sustainable beauty, as well as discussions on how to incorporate eco-conscious practices at home for daily skincare routines without compromising local cultural aesthetics in Bali or elsewhere across Asia where Balinese artistry touches lives.

The festival organizers aimed with these efforts to draw attention from tourists who may previously have been unaware of sustainable makeup and its significance, especially considering that traditional Indonesian beauty often emphasizes natural ingredients like coconut oil or aloe vera instead of chemical-based alternatives.
