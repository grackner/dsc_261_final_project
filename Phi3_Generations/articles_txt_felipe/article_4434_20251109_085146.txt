A beloved Disney star has made a surprise return to Hollywood following her hiatus from acting due to health concerns. Emily Rose Peterson was last seen onscreen in "Frozen II" back in March of this year, where she reprised her role as the voice of Princess Aurora for a new animated feature film based at Universal Studios Florida set to open next month.

Peterson, known for bringing characters like Elsa and Anna from Disney's Frozen series into homes around the world, had taken time off work since October last year due to undisclosed medical reasons. Now that she has returned, fans are celebrating her triumphant comeback with open arms during previews of "Magnificent Adventure."

"I am beyond thrilled and honored by this opportunity," said Peterson after the first preview screening on Friday at Universal Studios Florida in Orlando. “To finally return to my love for acting was truly magical, especially being back where I started - Disney.” 

The animated film follows a young girl who discories her family's past and begins an extraordinary journey through various world-building locations within the studio itself – from classic cartoon landmarks like Toontown to futuristic settings. The storyline explores themes of courage, friendship, discovery, as well as Peterson’s signature voice work bringing depth to a variety of Disney characters throughout history alongside her co-stars - including veteran actors Tom Hanks and Tim Curry reprising their roles from the original Frozen series in cameo appearances.

“Working with Emily has been such an incredible experience,” remarked director Michael Scott as he shared his praise for Peterson's exceptional performance during a backstage interview, “Her talent is unmatched and her presence brings warmth to everyone involved.” 

Despite being well-received by audiences thus far - both critics and moviegoers have already made the trek down from all over North America just for previews of "Magnificent Adventure" – Disney producers are taking note, stating that they hope to extend her role in future projects.

“We're proud Emily’s comeback has been such a success,” said studio representative Karen Lee at the press conference announcing Peterson as one of four lead characters alongside Tom Hanks (Ella), Tim Curry (Oakley) and Harrison Ford (Gregory). “Emily brings so much depth to Aurora's character, especially given her history with Disney’s animated Frozen series.” 

This latest venture is not the first time Peterson has worked within a Disney project - she reprised Elsa in "Frozen II" after voicing Princess Aurora for three sequels based on Hansel and Gretel, which premiered at Universal Studios Florida back in October. Now with her role as both voice-over actress as well having physical appearances to match up against other actors alongside live action portrayals of the original story's characters - audiences will be able enjoy an unparalleled experience unlike anything they’ve seen before from this iconic studio for decades more.

Following a preview screening, which drew in crowds on Friday evening as well being livestreamed worldwide online, Peterson's fans can expect to see her return alongside the other leads when "Magnificent Adventure" opens nationally next month at select universes around North America.
