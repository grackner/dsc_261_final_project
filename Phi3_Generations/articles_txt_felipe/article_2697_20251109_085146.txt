It's a moment of pride for American sports history as weightlifter Sam Hair made Olympic debut at Tokyo 2020 despite battling with anxiety issues in the past. The Los Angeles native faced off against fellow competitors on Saturday, August 3rd during the men's lightweight category final (56 kg). Although he did not medal this time, his participation alone is a testament to courage and sportsm endurance within mental health advocacy circles.

"I was never going to let my anxiety define who I am or what I can achieve," Hair shared in an interview after the event. "For me it's all about perseverance, pushing through those doubts." This Olympic journey came just three years following his last competitive lift at a world-level meet held back home in California where he finished fourth among 20 lifters - not exactly gold and silver but still an impressive accomplishment for the then struggling athlete.

The mental hurdles Hair had to face were considerable, with anxiety often clouding his concentration on game days leading him far behind peers during competitions in New York or London Olympics back in 2016-2018 respectively. Yet he never let them cripple his determination - a trait that's led not only to numerous personal best lifts over the years but now even graced this elite international stage of competition alongside some exceptional talent from all around the world at Tokyo 2020, where thousands gathered in Ariake arena watching on television millions more across countries following.

Dr David Benaroya – a sports psychologist who has worked with numerous athletes dealing with anxiety disorders tells CNN that "It’s rare for individuals battling mental health conditions like Sam's to ever compete at such an international level." He adds, however: "Sam isn’t just competing but also challenging stigmas associated with these types of issues. His participation alone inspires a dialogue on how we can better support those dealing similar struggles."

While anxiety has been shown to impact one's ability during high-pressure situations such as lifting heavy weights, it doesn’t mean that Sam gave up pursuing his Olympic dream: "I didn't just want any medal. It had more meaning this time – showing how far I have come since my darkest days battling anxiety."

For now Hair is taking some well-deserved rest before heading back home after the Olympics where next week he will take part in charity events to raise funds for organizations working towards improving mental health among athletes. As one competitor told CNN: "Sam's a champion inside and out - not just on the field but as an advocate off of it too."

It remains uncertain whether Hair would qualify again if he decides so next year, yet his Olympic debut is already being hailed by many in sports world-wide who have seen firsthand what strength looks like. Not only physical prowess demonstrated under immense pressure but the unwavering spirit of an individual fighting to redefine how we view mental health within sport and society at large - making this a story that will surely resonate beyond these Olympic Games for years ahead.
