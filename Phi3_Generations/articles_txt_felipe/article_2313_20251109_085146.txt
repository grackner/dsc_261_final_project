In a surprising turn of events at this year's FIFA World Cup held in South Africa from June to July, soccer superstar Lionel Messi announced his retirement shortly before the semifinal match between Argentina and Belgium on Saturday evening (local time). The announcement shocked fans worldwide who have witnessed Messi transform into one of football’ enduring icons.

Raised in Rosario by immigrant parents, Messi's journey to stardom began with humble beginnings as he dribbled through defenders on the streets before being scouted at a young age and joining Barcelona FC. He spent his entire professional career predominantly wearing red stripes for both club colors in Catalonia—an exceptional feat amongst soccer legends, making him one of only three players to achieve this accomplishment alongside Johan Cruyff (FC Barcelona) and Cristiano Ronaldo(Real Madrid).

"It's bittersweet," Messi told reporters after the announcement at a press conference held in Cape Town. "But I can proudly say that my career has been one of unparalleled joy, growth as an individual while representing Argentina." The 34-year-old Argentine midfielder expressed gratitude for being able to represent his homeland and inspire young athletes growing up in Rosario.

CNN reports the retired player led a remarkable career featuring over 90 goals at club level, with eight Ballon d'Or wins (2009-13), seven Copas del Rey trophies including three consecutive from 2010 to 2012 and one in each of his first five seasons - an astonishing achievement. With Argentina earning their spot at the World Cup finals six times through Messi's tenure, he became a national hero celebrated as "The King" after scoring decisive goals during critical moments such as against rivals Brazil in 2014 and winning his fifth Copa America title with La Furia Roja in 2015.

Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni expressed shock at the news, saying: “Lionel has always been a fantastic player for Argentina but I never thought he would hang up his boots just before our semifinal against Belgium.” The retired legend's decision came after an injury-plagued season with Barcelona where injuries caused him to miss significant matches throughout the campaign, ending early on 16 January due to persistent knee problems.

"It was a difficult call," Messi shared during his press conference in Cape Town when asked about retirement's timing amidst an injury-marred year at Barcelona and Argentina reaching their first World Cup final since 2015 with Belgium as opponents this time around."My mind is made up, but it doesn’t mean I won’t cherish the memories or continue to support my team," he added.

As fans across South Africa mourned what they see as a national loss of one its finest talents in soccer history; experts believe Messi's impact will live on beyond his time spent donning Argentina shirt and FC Barcelona red armband, saying: “He took Argentine football to unprecedented heights. It was truly an honor for him."

Barcelona manager Xavi Hernandez commented that although they had hoped Messi's talent would remain intact throughout his tenure at the club; he accepted responsibility and said "
