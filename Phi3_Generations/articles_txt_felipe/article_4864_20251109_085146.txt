A military coup in Iran unfolded yesterday as a faction within the country's armed forces seized control of key institutions amid widespstatic unrest over economic woes and political dissatisfaction. The upheaval began late last night when tanks rolled into Tehran, quickly followed by helicopters patrolling city streets. Iranian officials have yet to respond publicly as the new regime consolidates power throughout various cities across the country.

The unrest erupted in early February after years of economic sanctions took a heavier toll on ordinary citizens struggling with inflation and dwindling job prospects, setting off protests that grew more vocal against alleged government corruption. The situation escalated when Iran's Revolutionary Guards launched aerial attacks targeting pro-reform demonstrators in Tehran last night as military personnel took over the central command center earlier this evening at 9:30 pm local time, prompting an outcry from opposition groups and international observers alike.

A witness to yesterday's events told CNNMoney that she heard helicopters hover above her home in Tehran just before midnight when a sudden barrage of gunfire began near the parliament building nearby; protesters fought back against police forces trying desperately to maintain order amid what appears an ever-widening schism between different factions within Iranian society.

"It's like watching history unfold right in front our eyes," said Azadeh Fardan, a 34-year-old graphic designer who attended anti-government rallies earlier this year but stayed away yesterday fearing for her safety due to increasingly aggressive crackdown by authorities. "I felt like it would be better if we could just find peaceful ways of expressing our grievances, not through violent means."

Military sources tell Al-Jazeera that around 30 armed units are now positioned throughout Tehran and surrounding provinces including Isfahan in the center of Iran as well as Tabriz located northwest from the capital. The forces have already taken over control rooms, strategic bridges connecting cities like Mashhad to Khorramabad on Afghanistan's border near the city known for its historical bazaar filled with brightly colored tapestries and embroidered carpets crafted by local artisans.

One of those involved in yesterday's clashes, former university student Mohammad Ali Javadi recalls that chaos broke out during his demonstration outside the Tehran Stock Exchange when tear gas filled the air after an altercation between protesters and security forces at 10:30 pm local time; he says he was marching peacefully, though thousands of people joined in shouting slogans against "corrupt leaders" before being dispersed by live ammunition.

Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei is expected to address the nation tonight on national television as international powers call for dialogue with political representatives across various factions within Iranian society rather than external intervention; however, it remains unclear whether his comments will bring any resolution in such tense times.

Reports from Europe indicate some countries are reconsidering their diplomatic approach to the crisis after months of stalemate over Tehran's nuclear program but these nations have so far refrained from offering direct support for anti-government rallies amid concerns that doing so could further destabilize
