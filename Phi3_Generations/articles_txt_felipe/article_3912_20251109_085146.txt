A man accused of masterminding a complex series of fraudulent investment schemes across multiple states was arrested this week by federal authorities in New York City on Wednesday. Federal prosecutors announced the arrest as part of an extensive investigation into money laundering, securities fraud and wire communications violation crimes involving nearly $10 billion.

Authorities say 47-year-investment broker John Doe orchestrated schemes that targeted both individuals and financial institutions in New York, California, Texas, Florida, and Illinois between January 2015 to December of last year. The fraudulent activities involved false promises of high returns on investments with little risk for participants who ultimately lost their money due to a lack of transparency about how the funds were being used or invested by Doe's operation, according to court documents filed Thursday detailing charges against him.

"John managed these fraudulent operations like an MMA fighter incapable of defending himself when attacked," said U.S. Attorney Benjamin Brafman at a press conference where he unveiled the indictment document, which cited more than 10 counts relating to wire communications and securities fraud that were allegedly committed during his time managing these schemes on behalf of others while posing as himself.

A former employee of Doe's firm told investigators she witnessed first-hand some investors receiving phone calls from him, which resulted in them transferring funds into an account under the company name without knowledge that those accounts were fraudulent: "I knew John was hiding something about where this money went but I had no idea it wasn't just being deposited there with our own hard-earned cash," said Janet Carter, 45 at a separate news conference held in Chicago by Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul.

The employee also allegedly observed some investors receiving "automated" emails advising them to transfer their invested funds back into the company account as Doe continued making false statements about his business and operations, according to court documents citing her interview with authorities in Chicago on Thursday morning: "He'd say things like 'Don't worry guys there is still time,' but he wasn't telling us anything new," Carter claimed.

Federal prosecutors hope that the arrest will aid their investigation and provide an opportunity to gather additional evidence against other individuals who may have been complicit or unknowingly participated in Doe's schemes, said Brafman at Thursday's press conference: "This is a multi-layered operation spanning decades involving thousands of dollars paid out by innocent Americans," he added.

Doe was arrested without incident near Times Square shortly after 9 am Wednesday while on the way to his own office, where authorities seized several pieces of electronic equipment believed to contain evidence in connection with these cases, court documents filed late last night detailed charges against him and other alleged co-conspirators. Doe faces up to six years imprisonment if convicted under federal laws for wire communications fraud among others related offenses as well multiple counts of investor money laundering in each case involving the individual states impacted by his schemes, prosecutors said Thursday evening during a press conference here at Penn Station where he is currently being held on $2.5 million bail pending trial set for April 10th next year
