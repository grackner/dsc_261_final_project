During a sunny afternoon last Saturday in downtown Manhattan at Liberty Plaza near Wall Street, an unexpected event unfolded as protesters erected what they claim to be the world's first ever 'Green Skyscraper'. A towering edifice covered with lush rooftop gardens and energy-efficient design has attracted international media attention.

Built by a team of architects under the leadership of renowned designer Lina Martinez, this eco-friendly masterpiece stands at 50 stories tall – yet it boasts only half that number in actual usable space due to its innovative design for maximizing green areas. The project's main goal was not just an architectural wonder but also a symbol of environmental activism and hope amidst the city’climate crisis debate, especially after recent hurricanes underscored vulnerabilities within urban infrastructure.

City officials are currently evaluating whether to grant it official recognition as one of New York's historical landmarks or at least certify its green credentials through existing environmental standards for buildings in the area since no new law specifically addresses this avant-garde style yet, according to local press reports citing Mayor Eric Adams and city council members.

The protest organizers said that their aim is "to inspire future developments worldwide" by showcasing how modern architecture can coexist with nature rather than compete against it for space in heavily built-up cities like New York City, where the skyline has traditionally been dominated by concrete structures.

Maria Gomez, a protester and landscape architect involved in planning this project alongside Lina Martinez, said: "We wanted to create something that reflects our commitment to sustainability but also challenges conventional thinking about urban environments." The skyscraper’s design features extensive use of recycled materials from other construction projects around the city as well an emphasis on natural ventilation and lighting over reliance on artificial climate control systems.

Expert opinions vary widely within architectural circles, with some hailing it a visionary move forward while others question its practicality or durability compared to traditional skyscrapers amid New York's harsh weather conditions such as strong winds and heavy snowfall during winter months which could potentially damage sensitive plant species on top of the building.

"While this is an ambitious project that merits appreciation for its bold approach towards sustainability in architecture, we need to balance aesthetics with long-term maintenance requirements before declaring it suitable as permanent city infrastructure," notes James Lin, senior urban planner and professor at Columbia University School of Architecture.

Many locals see this eco-skyscraper not just as an architectural marvel but also symbolizing hope for more sustainable futures amidst escalating climate crises across the globe today – something residents have been yearning to manifest into reality since devastating hurricanes hit New York City last fall leaving behind severe flooding and damage.

Although it may take years before we see such buildings appearing elsewhere, some experts believe that this initiative could serve as an inspiration for architects worldwide by demonstrating how modern urban landscapes can incorporate green spaces without sacrificing aesthetic appeal or functionality of living in densely populated cities like New York.

"If more developers follow suit and integrate similar designs into their projects, we might just see the beginning of a new era where concrete jungles
