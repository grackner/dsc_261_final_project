A military coup in Egypt has resulted in a state of emergency being declared across the country as President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi called for calm amidst growing unrest among citizens frustrated by economic hardships and political repression, CNN reports on Tuesday. In an early morning address outside Cairo's heavily guarded presidential palace since a group of military officers forced the sitting government to flee in protest against corruption scandals implicating high-ranking officials, el-Sisi sought to assuage fears and quell dissent by promising swift action.

However, as chaos ensued with people flooding into Cairo's Tahrir Square demanding answers while the country grapples for power in a new era of uncertainty, tensions escalated throughout Egyptian cities where some military supporters have taken up arms to protect el-Sisi loyalists from opposition and strikes aimed at destabilizing what they deem as illegitimate governance.

The situation began with soldiers storming the presidential palace in downtown Cairo just before dawn, following which President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi took refuge inside his heavily guarded home hours later amidst increasing protests against corruption within his administration and demands for swift economic reforms. The military junta's decision has shocked Egyptians who had seen progress in recent years after a wave of revolutionary uprisings since 2011 that overthrew long-time autocratic rulers Hosni Mubarak, Mohamed Naguib and Anwar al-Sadat.

"We are witnessing unrest within our own ranks - brothers fighting against brothers – because we want to see a change in Egypt," said one anonymous senior security source who had fled Cairo after the military takeover but spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, reports Reuters. He added that there were indications some members within el-Sisi's entourage might be sympathetic to protestors’ demands and could act as mediators between them and their former leaders in the military hierarchy responsible for instigating coups throughout Egyptian history since 1952 when Mohamed Naguib seized power from King Farouk I.

Cairo's streets were largely deserted except at Tahrir Square where a massive protest against economic mismanagement and political repression was still raging while rumors about imminent violence circulated among some of the estimated 10,000 people who had gathered since Friday night outside Cairo.

"Our struggle must continue until we get what we want – dignity for Egyptians," said Ahmed Mohammed Samir, a university student from Assiut in southern Egypt and an avid protester at Tahrir Square during the Arab Spring uprisings against former President Hosni Mubarak.

Mohamed Zain el-Shafaly with the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIL) said his militant group would offer no support for anyone who attempts to overthrow any ruling government in Egypt, not even Sisi's regime which he accused as an "illegitimate dictatorship." The statement came after some hardcore Islamists called on their supporers within ISIL-controlled territories across Iraq and Syria – including Mosul - to stand with el-Sisi who they viewed sympathetic
