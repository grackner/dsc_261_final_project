NEW YORK CITY – The Brooklyn Nets basketball team hosted a thrilling win against the Philadelphia 76ers last night at Barclays Center in downtner East New York, marking their fifth consecutive victory over the Sixers this season as they ramped up to compete for the NBA's Eastern Conference crown.

The highly anticipated match took place on Friday evening when Brooklyn swept through Philadelphia with a score of 107-98 after four quarters and an intense final period that saw both teams fight hard until late in regulation before ultimately leading to overtime, where the Nets prevailed by five points.

"It's been amazing," said Brooklyn forward Kyrie Irving on postgame media day at MSG Network Headquarters near Madison Square Garden after winning his eighth consecutive game against Philadelphia. "We just had an electric atmosphere tonight, and it showed in the court." The rookie guard is known for lightning-fast moves around the opposing defenders that often leaves them scrambling to keep up with him on both ends of the floor – skills he honed at Virginia Commonwealth University before joining Brooklyn.

Nets coach Kenny Atkinson credited his team's performance against a resilient 76ers squad, saying: "We played our best game tonight and came back from being down by double digits in overtime." It was the first time since October that the Nets led at halftime or finished with more than sixteen points.

Atkinson's team also demonstrated their tenacious defense during last night’s encounter, as evidenced through a steal-and-score play from Brooklyn forward Joe Harris in overtime when Philly had just five seconds left on the clock: "We are going to give them hell every single day," he added. The Nets' performance against their archrivals has been key this season, as they have gone 7-4 overall and swept Philadelphia twice since starting a four-game winning streak at home earlier in November with victories of eleven points each time (6/10).

Brooklyn had never lost consecutive games to the Sixers before last night's victory. In fact, they only managed one loss against Philly during this stretch – an overtime game on December 8 when Brooklyn won by just six points after falling behind early in regulation (7/10). However, head coach Kyrie had learned from that defeat and has since led his team to a series of victories where they've been able to exploit the Sixers weak defensive backcourt.

"We need them tonight," he said on Wednesday during preseason practices at the Barclays Center in Downtown Brooklyn, New York City (6/10). "They are a little thin against perimeter shooting and ball movement." In response to last night's win over Philadelphia, Nets fans showed their support by chanting “Brooklyn Streaking” during halftime celebrations on Friday when the team took advantage of Philly’s defensive gaps.

Experts say this could be a sign that Brooklyn is aiming for an Eastern Conference title run since it sets up them as heavy favorites in their last seven matchups against 76ers (5/10). The Nets are scheduled to play Philadelphia twice before Christmas, with the first game taking place at Barclays Center on Tuesday evening.
