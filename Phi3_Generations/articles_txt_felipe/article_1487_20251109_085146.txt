A recent study conducted by a team of international researchers has found that regular physical activity can significantly reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes in adults over 40 years old. The findings, based on data from participants across six countries, were released today at an annual health conference held in Berlin this weekend (April 15-20).

Dr. Emma Thompson, one of the lead researchers behind this study and a senior cardiologist specializing in exercise physiology states that "regular physical activity can improve not just our overall fitness levels but also help prevent chronic diseases like heart disease or diabetes." The team collected data from over 20,00 extramurally-physically active individuals between the ages of 40 and above in Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and Greece.

Their findings revealed that those who engaged in at least thirty minutes of moderate exercise like brisk walking or cycling four times a week had a 30% lower risk for developing heart-related complications than sedentary individuals within the same age group. The study also uncovered similar positive effects on blood sugar control, reducing chances by up to 45%.

Dr. John Davis, an endocrinologist and another lead researcher explained that "physical activity not only increases our strength and stamina but it improves insulin sensitivity which is crucial for regulating glucose levels." The study's results are consistent with previous findings in the United States where physical fitness has been linked to a lower risk of chronic diseases.

Dr. Thompson emphasized that "a 30-minute exercise session four times per week is not overly time consuming and can be incorporated into our daily routine without much difficulty." She suggested making small changes like taking the stairs instead of elevators or choosing to walk short distances rather than driving, as simple ways for people starting their fitness journey.

Maria Rodriguez from Portugal shared her personal experience; "I started walking in my 40s and found out that I can keep up with young adults without any difficulty." Her story mirrored many others who discovered the benefits of incorporating regular physical activity into daily life, not just for reducing disease risk but also improving overall mood and well-being.

Given these findings' promising implications on public health strategies worldwide, governments are being urged to encourage exercise by creating more accessible facilities like parks or gyms in communities nationally as part of their national fitness campaigns aimed at improving the wellbeing and quality life expectancy.

Dr. Thompson concluded with a hopeful note for all those over 40, "It's never too late to start taking care of yourself - remember that small steps can make big changes." With these findings in mind, people worldwide are being encouraged to take up physical activities and live healthier lives while preventing chronic diseases.
