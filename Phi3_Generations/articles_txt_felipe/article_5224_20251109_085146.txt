A massive fire broke out in Nairobi's Central Business District on March 15th, engulfing multiple buildings and forcing thousands of people to evacuate their homes early Sunday morning. Witnesses reported seeing thick plumes of smoke billowing from the skyline as emergency services raced against time to contain the blaze before it could spread further across one of Africa'seldest cities'.

The inferno, which authorities suspect started at a local nightclub frequented by tourists and locals alike just after midnight near Cairo Street, quickly grew out of control. The flames reached sky-high in minutes due to strong winds that carried the fire towards high-rise buildings within close proximity, creating chaos among residents who were fast asleep or still awake when it struck around 1am on March 15th.

As smoke billowed out into Kenya's bustling capital city of over 4 million people during peak hours for traffic congestion; authorities feared the blaze could easily spread to other residential complexes and offices located near Ongwedivi Park, home base for many business moguls operating in Nairobi. The fire department dispatched helicops alongside ground units while airport officials temporarily shut down Kenya's international hub of Jomo Kenyatta International Airport because smoke plumes were visible from the terminal area located about 12 kilometers away, causing travelers anxiety and concern for their safety as well.

The blaze consumed several buildings including a five-star hotel known to host foreign dignitaries visiting Nairobi - creating an unexpected crisis in one of Africa's most cosmopolitan cities just weeks before Kenya hosts the African Nations Championship from April 21st through May 4th. Accordingly, President Uhuru Kenyatta has since announced a disaster fund set aside to assist affected residents and businesses throughout Nairobi - with further updates expected on how insurance claims will be handled by policy holders in what remains one of the most devastating fires seen anywhere within Africa's East African nation.

A source close to emergency responders working tirelessly overnight at Cairo Street told eNCA that "it has been a trying night, but we are confident our combined expertise and resources will help contain this blaze as quickly as possible." Firefighters battled the flames with water hoses mounted on fire trucks while rescue teams evacuated people trapped in upper-level floors of multi-story buildings across a two-kilometer radius from where it all started.

"I just woke up feeling something was wrong and saw smoke coming through my window - we had to escape before the police arrived," said Jane, who lived on 2nd floor near Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in her home for over ten years with husband Richard while raising their two children together after meeting as university classmates back then nearly three decades ago. "It was like being awake from a nightmare; we thought our whole lives were gone."

Experts fear the blaze may have been intentionally started by vandals who wanted to create chaos before President Kenyatta's trip scheduled for April 27th - an event which will see thousands of Africans and foreigners gathered in Nairobi with hopes pinned on Africa unifying its peoples through sportsmanship. Unfortunately, security sources have not confirmed whether foul play was involved or if the fire
