In a significant military development in Yemen on Tuesday evening, reports emerged that Iran and Houthi rebels are increasing their presence near Saudi Arabia's strategic coastline of the Red Sea at-ease with international mediation efforts to resolve tensions. This follows weeks of escalating conflict between Riyadh and Tehran backed forces, which threatened regional stability last month when a series of missile strikes hit major cities in Saudi Arabia before pausing amid the UN Security Council’semediations.

"I believe this ceasefire has offered us an opportunity to work towards peaceful solutions," said Dr. Amal Jaber, senior analyst for Middle East affairs at Oxford University's Department of International Development. "While we see a temporary halt in hostilities due to the mediation efforts and international pressure on Iran, it remains critical that these negotiations continue with earnest."

Yemenis expressed cautious optimism as they sought normalcy amidst months-long conflict instigated by sectarian divisions between Saudi Arabia's Sunni majority and Iranian Shiite support. Amid this backdrop of political unrest, the world watched in concern as regional powers were pulled into a proxy war that has claimed thousands of lives since it began last March, with children making up one-third of those killed or injured according to UNICEF statistics released earlier this year.

Saudi Arabia and its allies have accused Iranian proxies - the Shiite Houthis - who hold Yemen hostage as well their own forces in northern Saudi territories along oil pipelines that supply vital energy resources across Asia, of carrying out a series of attacks to destabilize regional order. Conversely, Tehran maintains its support for embattled Houthi rebels has been purely defensive with no intention whatsoever towards harming foreign interests beyond repelling Saudi forces from their own territory backed by Western allies and Gulf Cooperation Council member states.

The UN Security Council imposed unprecedented sanctions on Tehran, including an arms embargo in December to curb its regional interference while the international community remains divided as they seek a political solution that satisfies both Saudi Arabia's national interests and Yemenis who desire stability after years of strife. Diplomats from around 15 countries met at UN headquarters Monday with Secretary-General Antonio Guterres hosting closed doors talks between Riyadh, Tehran and various stakeholders in the conflict including representatives for rebel groups based within Yemen's Zaatari refugee camp along Jordanian border.

"While this ceasefire provides us some relief from suffering atrocities on a daily basis here [in camps], we still see signs that fighting continues despite our best efforts," says Amal Mohammed, 32-year-old father and former Yemeni civil servant who has now spent over five years in Zaatari refugee camp.

Saudi Arabia's military chief of staff General Raed Saleh affirmed Tuesday that "hostilities would continue" despite the ceasefire, warning his forces remained prepared for further conflict should tensions not ease during discussions with Iranian commanders and Yemeni factions. Houthi officials have also vowed to remain on guard as they assess how sustainable this truce may prove amid concerns that it could only be temporary without a political resolution reached through negotiations led by
