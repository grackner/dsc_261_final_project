In Paris yesterday evening, renowned art dealer Philippe Dubois was apprehended by authorities in a multimillion-dollar art fraud involving stolen Renaissance paintings thought to be safely housed at his gallery. The Metropolitan Police have confirmed that they seized several works of art believed to date back as early as the 15th century from Dubois' private collection, which had been displayed for public viewing without proper verification over two years prior.

Dubois managed to pass off a series of Renaissance masterpieces including "La Vita di Dante" by Botticelli and Leonardo da Vinci’s “Ginevra de' Melzi” as authentic, sourcing the pieces from obscure auctions where provenance records were sketchy at best. Dubois himself had claimed these rare treasures hailed directly from Italian museum vaults with no intermediaries in between during gallery openings and exclusive viewing sessions that took place until March of this year when suspicries started to arise due to incongruent restoration details noticed by experts present at the exhibit.

“This shocking discovery is a blow not just for our city’s art heritage, but also tarnishes Paris as an internationally respected hub,” stated Jean-Pierre Martin, Director General of Paris' National Museum of Fine Arts who had worked closely with Dubois on previous acquisitions. “It underlines the importance of robust due diligence procedures and reinforces our pledge to return these stolen pieces back home.”

The Metropolitan Police are urging anyone aware of similar activities or possessing information regarding this massive art heist, which has robbed thousands from various patrons worldwide, not to hesitate in coming forward. The Parisian Department for Culture and the French Ministry of Europe now plan on implementing more stringent regulations that demand detailed provenance investigations as a mandatory prerequisite before displaying any piece within public exhibitions across France’s renowned galleries henceforth.
