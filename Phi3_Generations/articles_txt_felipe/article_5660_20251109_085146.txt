A sudden and severe thunderstner in Oklahoma yesterday evening has caught meteorologists by surprise as they forecasted clear skies for most of the state. The storm hit on Wednesday night around dusk near Tulsa, where a ferocious downpour led to flash flooding within minutes with water levels rising rapidly across multiple streets and neighborhoods inundating cars and houses alike.

This is not the first time severe weather has impacted Oklahoma; however, meteorologists from NWS (National Weather Service) noted that such unexpected storm events have become increasingly frequent over recent years due to climate change, with many arguing for a need to revisit prediction models used in this historically prone state. "It's critical we improve our understanding of the impacts these extreme weather patterns are having on Oklahoma and refine our forecasting techniques," said John Smithson, chief meteorologist at NWS Tulsa office.

As per local police reports received around 6 PM yesterday, several vehicles were stuck in flood waters after torrential rains started pouring down from seemingly clear skies just hours beforehand leading to significant property damage and disruptions across various communities near the Oklahoma River where water levels rose as much as six feet above average during peak hourly rain.

An emergency dispatcher working for Tulsa Fire Department reported, "It's truly heartbreaking seeing our community suffer like this because of something that seems to be out of our control – nature." The rainfall lasted for about three hours with wind speeds reaching up to 35mph during the peak of storm activity creating hazardous driving conditions and forcing many residents indoors until roads were cleared from water.

In light of these events, there is a growing demand among Oklahomans that their government invest more in infrastructure capable of handling such natural disasters as well as funding research aimed at understanding how climate change affects local weather patterns to better predict future conditions and possible implications for the region's residents. Experts from University of Oklahoma suggest focusing on improving urban drainage systems while also taking into account projections that indicate more frequent occurrences in this part of America due largely attributed with global warming leading scientists worldwide scrambling to find answers as they work towards adapting existing weather models for future predictions.

"It's not just about preparation; it’s a race against time," said Dr. Emily Thompson, an atmospheric science professor at OU who has been studying the impact of climate change on Oklahoma's severe weather patterns closely over past decade through extensive ground surveys and satellite data analyses conducted across various seasons throughout state lines as part her research studies being carried out under grants provided by governmental agencies such National Science Foundation (NSF). "Our goal is not only to better understand these storm systems but also how we can reduce their impact on our communities when they do occur."

Thompson added that although forecasting models are continually improving, she believes it's crucial for local authorities and emergency responders alike take an active role in educating the public about personal safety measures during extreme weather events. The National Weather Service plans on hosting several workshops to help equip Oklahomans with knowledge regarding evacuation routes; safe shelter options, recognizing signs of potential flash floods among many other topics as part a multi-pronged approach towards building resilience against such natural disasters in the region.
