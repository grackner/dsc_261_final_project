In a rare meteorological phenomenon that caught scientists and skywatchers by surprise last Thursday evening in Miami Beach, residents experienced what some are calling "the most incredible rainbow" they've ever seen – reported CNN Meteorologist Michael Kay on May 20th. The vibrant arc appeared shortly after a downpour of unusual intensity, painting the skies with an array of colors that even drew crowds from miles around for pictures and observations at sunset hours last Thursday night.

Eyewitnesses describe seeing shades they say were particularly brilliant against the backdrop of Miami's palatial architecture; a kaleidoscope spanning over five minutes in full bloom before fading into the city’s twilight skyline as darkness descended, according to reports from local residents and tourists alike.

Dr. Anna Martinez, an atmospheric scientist at Miami's Oceanographic Institute tells CNN that this rare event is due to a phenomenon known as "fire rainbows," which occurs when sunlight passes through ice crystals in high cirrus clouds causing colorful bands of light along with the common double-headed arcs. 

"It’s incredibly uncommon, especially for tropical regions like Miami and particularly so at this time because these conditions typically occur near polar latitudes," Dr. Martinez explains. "The particular weather patterns on that Thursday night were unusual enough to allow ice crystals high in the atmosphere while providing sunlight from a low-lying position."

Meteorologists are analyzing data, seeking answers as they try not to dismiss it as an optical illusion but acknowledge how rare such occurrences can be. Mayor Carlos Gomez shared his appreciation for this beautiful surprise saying "In the rush and hustle of our city life, witnessing a sight like last night's rainbow was refreshing."

The mayor has urged residents to share experiences online using #MiamiRainbows. The Miami-Dade County Office also reported an influx in tourism over the weekend due to this meteorological spectacle that brought together not just locals, but people from as far away as Orlando and New York City for a fleeting glimpse of something so rare on Earth - all while scientists continue their research into these extraordinary atmospheric conditions. 

As we eagerly await further updates about this incredible weather phenomenon by the world-renowned Miami Weather Network, residents are reminded to stay safe and enjoy any future spectacles nature might have in store for us - responsibly of course.
