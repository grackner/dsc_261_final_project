"In a groundbrein-changing development for democracy in Asia, Thailand's deposed Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra has been formally charged with sedition and corruption by the country’s authorities this Monday morning (June 5). The charges come after months of civil unrest following a disputed election last year that resulted in military takeovers.

Shinawatra, who led her family's Democrat Party to victory before being ousted from power amid mass protests against alleged political corruption and cronyism, faces two years in prison if convicted. Her supporters have rallied nationwide demanding charges be dropped or reduced as they see Shinawatra as a symbol of resistance against undemocratic forces seeking to maintain control over Thailand’s government for decades.

"This is an attack on democracy itself," says Somsak Thepsen, a political analyst at Bangkok's leading business school and one who has followed Shinawatra closely throughout her controversial career in politics. "Making the leader of opposition parties criminal could set dangerous precedents."

The most recent coup in May, led primarily by Prayuth Chan-ocha who ousted Shinawatra while on trial himself accused of abusing his position as army chief to gain an unfair political advantage during elections held under military rule at the end of 2013 and beginning of this year.

Protests against charges continue across Thailand with supporters taking part in nationwide marches calling for Shinawatra's release or amended sentence on Wednesday, while her detractors are demanding stricter action be taken to curb political instability and violence from within the country.

"I don’t see any justice in this," says a supporter speaking at one of these marches outside Bangkok yesterday (June 7). "We will not stop until our voices are heard." As Thailand navigates its path towards democracy, many here fear more backlash against political activism as the military-backed government pushes forward with their agenda in dealing directly and swiftly to perceived threats of instability or disorder.

"A strong hand is required," adds another protester at a separate event yesterday (June 6). "We need firm leadership from our elected officials, not those who want power for themselves." Experts weighing in on Shinawatra's case suggest that the
