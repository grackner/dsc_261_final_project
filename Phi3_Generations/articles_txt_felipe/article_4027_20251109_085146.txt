Bali's Serene Beaches Now a Battleground for Eco-Tourism Balance

By Jane Smith | CNN Indonesia Correspondent - March 15, 2024

Nusa Dua: A once picturesque stretch of Bali’ endured the worst ecological disaster in decades last week when a typhoon lashed across these pristine shores. The storm ravaged through Lombok and ended up causing major destruction on Balinese beaches that were previously frequented by tourists from around the world for their unspoiled beauty, serene ambiance, and vibrant marine life.

As of today, officials are working tirelessly to assess damage while also rebuilding efforts have begun in earnest throughout Nusa Dua's beaches. The most significant losses occurred on Bukit Penyairan (BP) Beach - known for its white sand and crystal-clear waters -- which saw a staggering 70% of tourist accommodations destroyed by the devastating wind force, along with extensive beachfront erosion that left only remnants in some places.

Experts say it could take up to three years before BP Beach can be deemed safe for re-entering tourists again and are calling on government bodies and local businesses across Nusa Dua's islands of the once untouched stretch now seen as a shell of its former self. "We must prioritize ecological sustainability when it comes to reviving Bali's stunning beaches," said Dr. Hadi, an environmental expert from UGM University who is advising local authorities on restoration efforts.

"It will take time and resources; however we hope that these unfortunate circumstances can serve as a wake-up call for the travel industry to become more eco-friendly," he added in interview with CNN Indonesia Correspondent, Jane Smith who arrived at Bali's southernmost tip last week.

"This disaster has not only affected tourism but also livelihood of locals dependent on beach activities and businesses along the coastline." says I Made Tri Suarda Wijayatunga, a local councilor representing Nusa Dua City Council who is working hand-in-hand with environmentalists in restoration efforts. "We need to find ways not only restore these beaches but also ensure that we can protect them against future natural disasters."

Efforts are currently underway by the local government and international aid groups, including WWF Indonesia as well as UNICEF who have already provided a small amount of financial assistance towards reconstruction. The next few months will be crucial in Bali's efforts to rebuild not only its infrastructure but also how best to move forward sustainably while balancing the interests and needs for continued tourism, local community welfare as well environmental stewardship along these beautiful shores of Lombok island.
