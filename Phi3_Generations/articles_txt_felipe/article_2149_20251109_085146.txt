"Floods in Louisiana Overwhelming Communities and Efforts to Recover as Residents Face Long-Term Displacement."

A major flood event has struck parts of Louisiana over the past week, impacting thousands of residents who now face long-term displacement. The deluge began on Monday with heavy rains caused by a slow-moving tropical system that dumped record volumes of rain across southeener regions of the state and forced evacuations in several communities including St. John's Parish, according to National Weather Service officials.

Residents say it feels as if their lives have been turned upside down since waters began rising around Friday night when they were hit with an unprecedented 18 inches of rain within a few days that overwhelmed drainage systems and caused rivers like the Amite to overflow, according to eyewitnesses.

“We’ve never seen anything quite this bad," said Janet Rousseau-Thompson in St. Bernard Parish, who along with her family had planned for evacuation but found themselves stranded as floodwaters rose around them quickly and without warning. “It was just unreal – we were stuck on the second floor when everything started coming down."

As of Tuesday morning, at least 10 people have died in Louisiana from storm-related incidents according to state officials; dozens more are still missing or trapped amidst rapidly rising waters. Many areas impacted by floodwaters remain cut off with limited access for first responders and volunteers seeking help due to the sheer volume of water as well as damage done over a long period of time, reports CNN meteorologists.

The Louisiana Disaster Operation Center reported that about 250 homes have been destroyed in St. Bernard Parish alone; officials say they are still unable to reach some neighborhoods and believe there could be hundreds more unaccounted for due to the severity of conditions across affected areas, according to a National Weather Service report.

Meteorologists warned that several inches of rain were expected overnight into Wednesday with additional concerns about possible flash flooding from continuing storms in parts of Mississippi and Alabama as well – which could further complicate rescue efforts already underway throughout the Southeastern United States, according to a NWS forecast.

"It's not just rain - it feels like being hit by an asteroid," said Mayor Thomas Bordna III about St. Bernard Parish during his Wednesday morning press conference where he appealed for help in providing shelter and resources as the community struggles with ongoing recovery efforts, reports The DailyMail Live blogging from New Orleans' Superdome shelters full of displaced residents who have lost everything they once had amidst this crisis.

"We need everyone to come together – now more than ever," said Rousseau-Thompson about her family and neighbors working alongside first responders, government officials, and volunteers in their efforts along with other Louisiana parishes that experienced significant impact from the floodwaters after weeks of record rain levels according to The Local News.

Members within St. John’s Parish say they are trying hard every day at a makeshift shelter located inside an old church building run by community leaders who have seen their town's devastating loss firsthand but remain hopeful for rebuilding what was lost and restoring lives back together, CNN meteorologists reported Wednes
