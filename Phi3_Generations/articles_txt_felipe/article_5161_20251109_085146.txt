New York City – In a shocking incident that has reignited concerns over gun violence in urban America, a high school student was fatally shot at Lincoln High School on Thursday afternoon as students were leaving campus. Witnesses say the shooting appeared to be random and targeted innocent teenagers returning from their final classes of the day. The New York City Police Department (NYPD) has launched an investigation into what could potentially become one of the deadliest school shootings in decades, prompting calls for stricter gun control measures across the country.

It was a routine Thursday afternoon when 16-year-injured teenager Ethan Harris returned to his classroom at Lincoln High School on Lexington Avenue just after noon looking forward to finishing up some last minute homework assignments and catching up with friends before leaving for the weekend.
"I thought it was Friday," said 16 year-old high school student, who wishes to remain anonymous as they fear retribution from unidentified individuals associated with this case. "No one expected what would happen."

The gunman opened fire in a hallway near Ethan's classroom around 12:30 p.m., wounding three students and hitting two before police arrived on scene at the victim’s side just five minutes after the initial sound of gunfire was reported to campus authorities by another student as well as faculty members present during an assembly held earlier that day.
The NYPD has confirmed there are no motives identified so far for this horrific act, which caused panic among those inside and led to a lockdown procedure being initiated across all city public schools after school was dismissed at around 2:30 p.m.. "Our top priority is keeping everyone safe," said Police Commissioner Dermot F. Shea in an evening press conference where he announced that the suspect had not yet been arrested, but police are confident they have his description and direction of escape from campus which will aid them greatly as investigations continue into this horrific act."

The NYPD has dispatched officers to all city schools for enhanced security measures while working closely with school officials on plans regarding lockdown procedures in the event future threats arise within their own halls. In addition, Mayor Bill De Blasio and Congressman Jerry Nadler issued statements condemning this vicious act of violence which they say is a clear sign that stricter gun control legislation must be put into place nationwide without delay according to both politicians' social media channels:

"The city’s heartbreak cannot stop with us—it stops now," said Mayor Bill De Blasio during an evening press conference broadcast on local news outlets across Manhattan and throughout the five boroughs where he announced that all federal agencies will temporarily halt their activities in support of law enforcement as well. "Let this be a wake-up call for everyone: We must come together to demand change before more lives are shattered."

Congressman Jerry Nadler stated via social media yesterday evening, “This senseless act has left our children and families devastated—it is time we stand united against this madness.” "We owe it ourselves as well – Americans everywhere deserve better!" he added later on in the same post urging his constituents across New York City but also around America not to lose hope amidst these grim circumstances: “Let’s fight for a safer future together,” concluded Nadler's last tweet which
