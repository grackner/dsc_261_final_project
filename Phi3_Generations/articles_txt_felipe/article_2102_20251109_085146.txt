A young actress born and raised in Los Angeles has captured the hearts of film enthusiastin across America with her breakout role as a lead character who overcomes personal challenges to achieve success on screen. Emma Thompson-Jones, just twenty years old, made headlines last week when she was featured at this year's Sundance Film Festival for her performance in "Bright Horizons", an indie drama that has now been picked up by a major Hollywood studio after rave reviews from audiences and critics alike.

Emma starred as Sarah, who battles against the odds to break into acting while dealing with family issues at home. Born in 2001 in Santa Monica, California, she is one of four children and credits her parents for encouraging their daughter's passion from a young age by taking them to see movies every weekend. Emma began attending acting classes when she was just eight years old and quickly demonstrated remarkable talent that propelled her through various stages in the entertainment industry, including local stage productions and independent films throughout college.

"Sarah's performance on screen is raw yet refined," says director Mark Wilson of "Bright Horizons". "Her ability to convey emotions while handling a demanding script has earned her recognition from both peers and established filmmakers." 

Earning critical acclaim at Sundance, Emma Thompson-Jones' career took off when the studio saw potential in her performance. They signed an exclusive deal for her next project immediately after the festival screened "Bright Horizons". The team is currently finalizing a script about another young actress navigating Hollywood and expects to shoot within two years of signing this contract with Emma, who remains humble despite newfound fame: 

"I am grateful that my journey has led me here," says the rising star. "But I want to remember where I came from – all those nights in front of a television screen watching stories unfold."
