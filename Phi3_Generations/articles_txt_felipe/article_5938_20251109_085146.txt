A powerful winter storm blanketed parts of Texas with snow and ice this weekend, causing widespde havoc as temperatures plunged to record lows in a state not accustomed to such severe cold weather conditions. The historic freeze began on Friday evening (March 17) and extended into Sunday morning before tapering off slightly by midweek. As of Tuesday, officials say that at least six people have lost their lives due to the frigid temperatures across various counties in Texas during this weather event named 'Winter Storm Grayson'. The National Weather Service reported freezing rain accumulations up to half an inch and ice cover as thick as one-eighth of an inch.

Austin resident Mark Thompson, 45, lost his footing while taking a shortcut through the neighborhood park early Saturday morning (March 19). "It was like walking on black ice," he recounted to authorities after slipping and falling face-first onto the frozen ground near Lakeside Park in East Austin.

Witness Nancy Rodriguez, who saw Thompson's fall from her bedroom window across the street said that she heard a muffled thud but did not immediately see anything as it was still dark outside due to cloudy skies and precipitation at high altitudes blocking out sunlight during this weather phenomenon.

Texas Governor Greg Abbott has declared an emergency statewide in response, activating the National Guard for snow removal along with mobilizing medical crews across counties most impacted by power loss due to fallen trees breaking electrical lines as a result of ice accumulation on branches and limbs that collapsed onto power infrastructure.

The Texas Department of Energy predicts widespread rolling blackouts through the weekend, which have affected millions in suburban Dallas-Fort Worth areas where temperatures can soar into triple digits during summer months when snow is a rare occurrence here at all times as well throughout rural counties on its southern border with Mexico.

Dr. Jane Smithsonian of Texas Tech University's Department of Meteorology stated, "This winter storm has caught many by surprise due to the rarity and severity of such events within our state." She further added that even though cold air masses are common in Canada or Alaska during their respective Winter seasons; it is extremely unusual for them to reach as far south into Texas.

As temperatures continue dropping below freezing point through Wednesday night (March 21), local governments advise residents and businesses to refrain from unnecessary travel, conserve water by using heated indoor spaces sparingly where possible while officials assess damages over the coming days with road closures likely on both sides of I-35 E into Dallas/Fort Worth area which may result in traffic delays lasting several hours as crews work to restore power.

Abbott has urged Texans not only to stay off icy roads but also conserve energy by reducing nonessential electricity usage throughout homes and businesses across Texas, amid growing concerns about the potential impact on vulnerable populations such as seniors living alone or individuals with medical conditions reliant upon electrical equipment for their wellbeing.

The Austin City Council met this morning (March 20) where Mayor Steve Adler addressed constituents during a brief emergency press conference at Town Hall, emphasizing the importance of community support and urging local residents to look out for neighbors who might need
