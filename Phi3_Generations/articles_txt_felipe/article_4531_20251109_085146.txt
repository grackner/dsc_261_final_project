A devastating earthquake measuring 7.8 on the Richter scale hit Greece early this morning with a depth of about seven kilometers near the country's northwestern region close to its Macedonian border, leaving at least five dead and over one hundred injured according to preliminary reports from emergency services as they continue search-andin-rescue operations.

The tremor struck just after midnight local time (UTC+3) in the area of Kozani near Thessaloniki with initial estimates suggesting a depth of seven kilometers, which is considered shallow and potentially more damaging to populated areas compared to deeper quakes that occur further from surface structures.

"The intensity here has been phenomenally strong; it's going to be challenging for the emergency services," commented Dr. Maria Petrova, a seismologist at Athens University who is analyzing data coming in following the earthquake. "We are preparing more detailed reports as we gather information from various sources."

Early images and videos shared by local citizens on social media showed significant damage to buildings close to epicenter with collapsed structures identified among them, including several historical sites around Kozani that hold cultural significance for Greece’s Macedonian heritage. The earthquake's ripple effects are already being felt in neighboring countries as well; tremors were detected even in Thessaloniki and Athens late this morning before dissipating at about 10 am local time (UTC+3).

As the full extent of casualties, injuries, or property damage becomes clearer over the coming days, authorities will need to prepare for additional aid requests as international non-governmental organizations and neighboring countries have already begun mobilizing support. "The priority is now on locals who live in affected areas," said Nikos Kourtidis, a spokesperson at Hellenic Civil Protection Department (CYA).

"We need to focus our immediate relief efforts there while simultaneously working with experts from across Europe and beyond." The earthquake is set against the backdrop of Greece's recent economic struggles; an estimated 25% unemployment rate and national debt standing at approximately €310 billion (US$376.8 billion) as per a report published earlier this year by European Commissioner for Economy, Pierre Moscovici.

The natural disaster comes after recent severe weather across the Balkans that has impacted millions of people in Albania and Montenegro alone while leaving at least 30 dead since last Thursday's landslides triggered floods causing massive damage to infrastructure along rivers such as Devoll, Acheron-Peneus.

"We need all hands on deck for the immediate recovery," stated Kourtidis with a hint of determination in his voice. "It’s going to take an enormous amount of work but our focus must remain firmly ahead."
