"Asian markets are showing mixed responses ahead of tomorrow's summit on economic cooperation between Japan and South Korea amidst a backdrop of historical tensions," reports CNN Asia Bureau Chief John Doe. Tokyo confirmed this morning that the anticipated high-level meeting will take place, aiming to address issues surrounding trade imbalances and intellectual property rights disputes over past years. 

Japanese officials expressed cautious optimism about improving relations with their neighbor on Wednesday in front of a joint press conference at Tokyo' hall - the site chosen for diplomatic discussions due to its symbolic neutrality amid both countries' historically sensitive relationship. Japanese Foreign Minister, Hiroshi Nakamura stated during today’s event: "We hope this summit will serve as an opportunity not just for businesses but also nations on either side of the Sea of Japan."

While South Korean President Moon Jae-in and Prime Minister Chung Min are preparing to join their Japanese counterparts in Tokyo, experts warn that progress could be slow. "Both countries have deeply ingrained historical issues which cannot simply disappear overnight," says Dr Jane Kim, a political science professor at Seoul National University who has studied relations between Japan and South Korea for decades.

On the ground here in Osaka where several thousand demonstrators are already mobilizing against what they perceive as continued Japanese imperialism – there's little hope among them that anything will change from Tokyo, but it remains to be seen if this summit can indeed mark a turning point between these two Asian powerhouses.

As the world looks on nervously awaiting developments out of Asia - analyst Paul Taylor at London-based Eurasia Group believes: "The outcome could significantly impact regional trade dynamics and even ripple into broader geopolitics as well." Despite this, he adds that both Japan's prime minister Suga Yoshihide and South Korea’s president Moon Jae-in must not underestimate domestic opposition on sensitive issues.

Next steps for the Asian neighbors include a post-summit press conference where progress or lack thereof will be revealed to their respective people as well as international audiences interested in seeing whether these historic talks can begin anew positive trajectory between two key economies of Asia - both with vast and interdependent business relationships.
