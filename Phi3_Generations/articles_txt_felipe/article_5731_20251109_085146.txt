A severe electrical storm struck New York City yesterday evening around 7 PM local time, causing widespdependent blackouts across various businesses and tech companies located in Manhattan's financial district as well as parts of Brooklyn. The National Weather Service reported that the region experienced lightning strikes followed by powerful thunderstorm wind gusts reaching up to 45 mph, leading to significant structural damage and power outages which lasted for several hours.

A spokesperson from JPMorgan Chase & Co., located at One Wall Street, commented on the impact: "The bank lost partial accessibility of our network but is implementing robust contingency plans while working with local authorities to restore operations." Meanwhile, a representative from Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Midtown Manhattan stated that their firm was also able to maintain essential financial services for clients and employees through backup generators.

Local IT experts warned companies against using unaffordable third-party repair or restoration service providers which may lead to data theft, compromised systems, and extended downtime: "Investing in professional cybersecurity measures during disaster recovery is critical," stated an industry specialist at a tech firm.

The New York Stock Exchange experienced minor glitches due to power outages but was able to resume regular trading operations within four hours as backup generators kicked in and the storm passed, according to spokeswoman for exchange operator NYSE Euronext: "Our priority is maintaining continuity of critical financial markets."

Businesses across all sectors were affected. At MoMA PS1, a contemporary art museum on Long Island City's Museum Mile, guests and staff members sought shelter in the building lobby while awaiting restoration: "We had to pause our gallery tours but made sure that no one was hurt," said curator of exhibits at MoMA.

Emergency services were called upon as some citizens reported hail damage on their homes, prompted by a sudden shift in weather patterns during the evening storms and causing several injuries which required emergency medical attention: "This is an unfortunate situation for many affected families," said Mayor Bill de Blasio.

As temperatures continue to drop towards winter season with further inclement weather forecasted, officials are urging citizens to prepare accordingly as they rebuild their lives and businesses disrupted by the recent power outage crisis: "We will work together as a city and find ways to recover from this hardship," added Mayor de Blasio.

Next steps include extensive inspection of infrastructure across New York City, repairing damages sustained during yesterday's storm while reinforcing measures against future threats caused by natural disasters such as these: "This experience reminds us that the world is unpredictable and we must be prepared," stated one expert on risk management.
