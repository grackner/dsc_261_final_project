In a stunning development on Saturday night in Anaheim Arena at Expo Place that will go down as one of the most controversial moments this season for the Los Angeles Kings hockey team, defenseman Jordan Eberle was seen leaving with apparent injuries just after midnight. Medical personnel are currently evaluating his condition; however, he has already reportedly told friends it might not be serious and that he expects to play in tomorrow's game against the San Jose Sharks at 7:30 PM Pacific Time (10:30 pde).

"I can feel a little sore but nothing too bad. I just grazed my leg on something sharp, it really caught me off guard," Eberle was quoted saying after leaving with his teammates in the dressing room following last night's game against Winnipeg Jets at 10:35 PM Pacific Time (2am edt). "I took a nasty hit but I guess my body just couldn’t handle it."

Eberle was seen skating on his own after the incident, trying to return to practice before being escorted off-ice by coach Mike Sorensen. A Kings fan sitting next row in section 123 witnessed Eberle's collision with an unidentified object near the boards and reported hearing a loud crack as he fell.

We understand this is not ideal but we have players who can step up when needed."

Los Angeles Sports Medicine Center has been informed to prepare a treatment plan for Eberle, which could include physical therapy or further diagnostic imaging if required by the evaluation today at 5 PM (10pm edt). With Kopitar's expected absence of roughly two days and Eberle’s potential recovery time still under review tomorrow after an assessment is made this afternoon.

“I want to remind everyone that safety comes first, not just on the ice but in life as well,” said Los Angeles Kings Public Relations Director Sarah Jennings during a press conference held earlier today where she announced both injuries and reassured fans about upcoming matches: "We have an incredible roster with players capable of stepping into different roles. Our season continues, no matter what."

As the anticipation builds among Los Angeles Kings supporters for Aaron Kopitar’s return against San Jose Sharks at Anaheim Arena tomorrow night in front of a full house expected to be around 20,453 fans (176k live on TV), concerns are also rising over how this injury will affect their star player Jordan Eberle's participation for tonight’s home match against San Jose Sharks. While the severity is yet unclear after initial evaluations and MRI scans have not been completed, it has nevertheless sent ripples throughout Los Angeles hockey circles with implications potentially leading to a
