In a recent development within Lebanon's tumultuous political landscape, pro-government rallies were held in Tripoli this weekend to support Prime Minister Saad Hariri’thelast Friday evening despite nationwide protests demanding his resignation. The turnout was estimated at around 10,000 citizens who flocked from various Lebanese cities and even beyond the country's borders, demonstrating unwavering loyalty to their leader amidst severe economic turmoil.

The rallies were organized by pro-Hariri political factions across different regions of Tripoli with Hariri making a surprise appearance at one such event in Batroun on Sunday morning before continuing his travels within Lebanon, including brief visits to the Beirut International Airport. The movement seemed to signal an attempt from both sides—protesters seeking change and rally supporters urging stability —to find common ground for dialogue through peaceful means as tensions continued unabated in other parts of the country where opposition-led demonstrations have escalated into violent confrontations.

Lebanese President Michel Aoun called on citizens to respect one another during these trying times, urging restraint and emphasizing that "We should not let anger lead us astray." In response, several pro-Hariri supporters echoed similar sentiments as they gathered at events across Lebanon.

One such individual was Amal al-Rabadiyya resident Fares Saadeh who described the turnout for Sunday's event in Tripoli: "It wasn't just about Prime Minister Hariri but also our hopes and aspirations as a nation." However, many protesters felt that only political reforms could address Lebanon’s crippling economic crisis.

The situation remains delicate with mounting international concern regarding potential escalation into armed conflict between pro-Hariri loyalists led by former Army commander Gen. Michel Aoun and opposition supporters, many of whom were reportedly calling for the prime minister's departure from office amid calls to overthrow Hariri’s government altogether after he made statements earlier in January that would appear antithetical towards pro-Syrian sentiments during his 2016 presidential campaign when Lebanon was embroiled with its civil war.

According to the latest UN Humanitarian Response Plans for Middle East and North Africa, over six million people are in need of humanitarian aid due largely because of political instability throughout these regions including Syria as well as Yemen which saw an escalation into armed conflict last year with Saudi Arabia supporting opposition forces there. In Lebanon's case however, sectarian divisions have remained at the core and amplified over decades-long economic decline since 2019 following Beirut’s catastrophic blast that destroyed large portions of infrastructure while widespread corruption continues to exacerbate public discontent.

Meanwhile, Hariri's office released a statement on Monday saying "We stand firmly with our Prime Minister and call upon all Lebanese citizens who believe in the same vision for their country: Peaceful change through dialogue." In this context of divided loyalties within its own borders that seem unlikely to resolve anytime soon, international observers are urging restraint on both sides as they closely monitor these unrests and plead governments involved take note.
