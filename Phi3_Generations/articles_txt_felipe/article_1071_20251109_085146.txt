An unprecedented event shook Cleveland'ries iconic stadium on Saturday night as a sudden blackout during an NFL game led to chaos and injuries among fans eager for the playoff experience they never got this season. The lights went out at around 8:30 p.m., with reports of stampedes towards exits, causing several fights in the stands that resulted in multiple minor injuries.

The Cleveland Browns versus Baltimore Ravens game was already a high-stakes affair; both teams are fighting for their playoff lives and hoping to clinch wins this Sunday before they hit season's end on Dec 12th, which would be an extraordinary accomplishment given the current circumstances of unpredictable seasons. As darkness encroached upon MetLife Stadium at around game time when suddenly power was abruptly cut off during a touchdown celebration by Browns fans - who are used to cheering and high-fiving each other after scores, but as we've seen with this season playing far out of the ordinary.

The blackout took place less than halfway through first quarter; when thousands stood huddled in their seats anxiously awaiting for play officials to break it up - which they did immediately by having stadium security clear a path and direct people towards exits as fast as possible, while fire trucks arrived on the scene within minutes.

Emergency services were dispatched quickly after reports of stampedes circulated through social media; where fans began panicking that everyone was trapped inside their seats before eventually reaching out for help via cell phones and stadium intercom systems - leading to a flurry of calls, texts, or messages directed at security staff as well.

The Browns head coach Nick Boso issued an official statement on behalf of his team expressing concern about the situation: "I am deeply saddened by this unexpected turn in tonight's game and extend my condolences to all those affected." His message garnered widespread attention, as fans took notice that a tragedy had occurred while they were celebrating - something none of them expected.

Footage from nearby cameras captured moments where groups attempted breaking free or crowding towards exits only for security staff and firefighters to intervene before any severe injuries could take place: an occurrence witnessed by many who shared the incident online, with one commenter sharing their account of what happened. "I was at my seat when suddenly everything went dark," commented user123456 on Twitter "@user_fanscry."

"At first everyone just started panicking and pushing each other out - I saw people falling down as they tried to get away from their seats or towards exits. It was chaotic but soon enough security stepped in, escorted us through the stadium with no major issues," added another commenter who wished to remain anonymous due to concerns about retaliation by fans: "@user_anonym01."

The Metropolitan Police Department and fire department arrived at MetLife Stadium shortly after 9 pm EST while on-site security coordinated efforts alongside emergency services personnel; where they worked together effectively ensuring all individuals were safely evacuated from the stadium. Firefighters confirmed that there was no risk of fires or explosions due to electrical malfunctions, which authorities are still investigating as a cause for blackout - an event believed not only rare but also highly concerning with regards its timing during such an important game in their NFL season's history
