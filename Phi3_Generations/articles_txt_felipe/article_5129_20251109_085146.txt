In a remarkable turn of events at the Tokyo Summer Games this year, athletes from various countries have expressed their disappointment as the International Olympic Committee announced that snowboarding would not be part of the official program for the first time in decades due to lack of representation and interest. The decision leaves competitors like Emily Johnson, an American freestyle rider who trained relentlessly at Winter Park Resort near Denver since January but had her Olympic dreams dashed on July 20th when she was informed about this unexpected cancellation by the IOC President Thomas Bach in Tokyo itself.

The snowboarding community has been shaken up, and reactions from competitors have ranged from disbelief to anger over not having a chance to showcase their talent before the world on July 24th when all athletes are expected to march under one flag during the Opening Ceremonies. While Emily says she understands that changes can happen, "I never thought my sport would disappear like this," Johnson added sadly as she returned from a training session in Whistler Blackcomb ski resort on July 21st with tears welling up.

"It's not just about the absence of competition but losing our voice for future generations too", said Tom Roberts, President of the National Snowboard Association (NSA) back home after he heard news while watching live coverage from Tokyo Olympic Stadium in Ushigome-Ku ward with his family. "This decision has profound implications beyond what'these athletes and our community can comprehend at present."

Snowboarding was last featured as a medal event during the 2018 Winter Games held on Japanese soil but failed to attract more than half of its representation compared to traditional winter sports. Critics argue that with better exposure through media like ESPN+ or NBCSN, snowboard's fan base could have been broadened enough for it not being canceled in Tokyo next year at the Beijing Winter Olympics 2022 – when experts predict upwards of eight million viewers tuning into live broadcast.

"I wish I knew more about how this decision came to pass," said Japanese snowboarder Hiroshi Yamamoto, who finished fifth in aerials back then but remains optimistic despite losing out on representing Japan again for another reason: "Hopefully with time and effort from all sides involved like myself we see better days."

IOC representatives have been reluctant to comment until they release their final report next month after deliberating over every aspect of inclusion, diversity, equality along gender lines that many believe led them here today. However, snowboarding coach Dustin McNaughton has urged fellow athletes who're feeling the same way as he is – devastated and heartbroken – to unite in solidar0rship: "It’s important now more than ever for all of us competing against each other at Tokyo 2020 not just individually but collectively because our sport will never be heard again without support from inside as well outside these Olympic walls."

Experts say this latest setback could potentially hurt snowboard's future prospects in global competition given its historical struggle for acceptance within athletic circles. Despite recent growth due to innovations like park events and freestyle formats gaining traction among younger demographics worldwide, doubters persist over whether interest levels are too low or if there is something inherent about snowboard's culture that still
