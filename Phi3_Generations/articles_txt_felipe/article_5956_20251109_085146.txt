In a startling discovery that could reshape our understanding of water on Mars, NASA's Perseverance rover has reported an unprecedented finding in Jezero Crater just over four months into its mission: the presence of hydrated minerals beneath layers of Martian soil. Scientists are cautiously excited as this suggests that there was once flowing water on Mars and raises possibilities for life to have existed long ago, a revelation announced yesterday in Washington Dulles International Airport after scientists gathered at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) before the rover’s scheduled departure.

The Perseverance team had been meticulously analyzing Martian soil samples ever since it touched down on February 18, and last week they came upon what looked like traces of hydrated minerals in a layer some two meters beneath the planet's surface near its entry site into Jezero Crater. Initially identified using spectrometers aboard Perseverance itself—and later confirmed with additional analysis on Earth from samples brought back by NASA’s Curiosity rover at Gale crater and other Martian explorers like the Soviet spacecraft Mars 3 in Viking Lander missions of the late '60s to early ‘70s—the discovery has caused a buzz across scientific communities.

"This is an incredibly exciting time for us," says Dr. Linda Green, chief geologist at JPL and leader of Perseverance's Martian soil investigation team. "The presence of hydrated minerals like clays or sulfates in these subsurface layers tells a compelling story about Mars’ past environment."

These findings came after years spent painstakingly analyzing dozens upon dozens of samples on Earth and studying data sent from spacecraft orbiting, descending into the Martian atmosphere. The discovery was made when Perseverance detected changes in spectral signatures during its first scoop-and-bake process for collecting soil samples to analyze back at JPL via drilling rigs.

"It’s like finding a buried treasure," Dr. Green says, looking over the data on her screen as she compares readings from various instruments aboard Perseverance with those taken by orbiters and other rovers throughout history of Mars exploration. "These minerals likely formed when water once stood in this area."

Perseverance’s latest find is just one chapter in our never-ending quest to understand the Red Planet—a venture that began nearly half a century ago with Mariner 4, NASA's first successful flyby of Mars. Back then, scientists only had surface images and limited atmospheric data from two other missions before them: Pioneer 3 in December '59; it was designed to study radiation near the Moon but failed due to engine cutoff issues after launching towards Venus instead - Mariner I/II (Mariners 4 & 6) between April and October of ’62, which captured colorful images that led people on Earth first imagined Mars as a deserted place with no water.

"It's hard to believe we thought there was absolutely nothing wet about the planet," says Dr. Charles Baker, senior scientist at JPL who helped design and operate Mariner 4’s cameras back then but now studies geological formations on Mars alongside Green for Perseverance team
