Japanese study finds extended daytime naps can improve cognitive function but may disrupt night-time sleep patterns among older adults; experts say moderation key [Updated] - By Kenji Takahashi, Tokyo Bureau Chief for Health & Wellness on Thursday. Researchers at the National Institute of Geriatrics in Japan have conducted a longitudinal study examining the effects of napping during daylight hours amongst individuals aged 65 and above over three years with findings suggesting that extended nap times can lead to shortened sleep duration when coupled with habitual nighttime rest.

According to data collected between May 2018-May 2in'',''; September 2020, more than 56% of participants who reported consistent daytime naps averaging above one hour experienced decreased overall sleep time by the study’s end date (September 3, 2020). "Daytime rest is essential for cognitive function and can rejuvenate older adults. However, our findings highlight that longer unplanned day-sleep sessions have a reciprocal negative effect on night sleep," states Dr. Ayumi Yamamoto who led the study at NIHG in Tokyo as reported by Kyodo News Service (Feb 14).

The investigation involved cognitive tests, self-reported rest habits and use of actigraphs — wearable devices which monitor activity levels throughout daily routines—on participants. Slight to moderate memory issues were observed across a majority -80%to73%, age group under study during baseline visits; these symptoms showed some improvement as the trials progressed according to early reports but later declined in many individuals towards end of monitoring period by over 5-6 hours, potentially due decreased nocturnal sleep.

"We need further research focusing on optimal nap duration that benefits overall health without compromising night rest," says Professor Kenji Suzuki from Tokyo Medical University who reviewed the study's findings for Health & Wellness Newspaper as quoted in their latest edition (Feb 15). He adds, "It would be prudent to advise older adults and caretakers about maintaining a balance between daytime rest periods while still ensuring sufficient nocturnal sleep."

The implications of these findings suggest that for senior citizens who wish or need to nap during the day could consider limiting this habit as part of holistic health approach; experts say awareness regarding impact on night-sleep is vital in addressing cognitive issues related with aging. "Sleep disruption can potentially lead us down a path towards more serious sleep disturbances like insomnia which often requires professional intervention," warns Dr Ayumi Yamamoto further stressing importance of seeking medical advice if sufferers consistently find it hard to fall asleep or maintain throughout night-time.

Reactions from community members range widely; some support these study's outcomes while others suggest that self regulation can work effectively for individual needs without overhauling their lifestyle completely based on comments shared by the public forum HealthyAgingTokyo which discussed this new research among senior citizens since it was first released (Feb 16).
