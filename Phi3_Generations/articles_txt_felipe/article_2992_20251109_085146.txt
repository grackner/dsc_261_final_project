In a stunning development within Latin American politics, Colombian President Ivan Duque announced on Friday his intention to seek re-election in April despite national laws prohibiting incumbents from campaigning for their own office. The decision came amid growing concerns over political stability and democratic integrity across the region. 

Colombia's constitution strictly forbids sitting presidents from running, a rule designed to maintain impartiality within government affairs at critical junctures of national development — but President Duque insists his continued leadership is vital for Colombia’ enduring peace process and security against remaining threats by dissident armed groups. 

"I love my country with all my heart," said the president in a nationally televised speech on Monday, "And I can't bear to see it slip into chaos while so many are suffering." Duque argued that his knowledge and experience of Colombia’s complex political landscape could benefit national recovery efforts. 

Colombian citizens have mixed reactions; some believe the nation needs experienced leadership now more than ever, but others fear such actions go against democratic principles set forth in their Constitution. Experts warn this move may embolden other leaders to flout constitutional norms for political advantage as well. 

Reactions from opposition parties have been outraged and widespread disbelief is evident, with calls for peaceful protest rises across the nation's capital of Bogotá amid fear that this move may set a dangerous precedent in South American politics — especially given recent global trends towards autocratic leadership. The Colombian National Assembly will now discuss potential actions to counteract Duque’s decision, with suggestions including impeachment proceedings or constitutional reforms aimed at tightening rules for sitting presidents' political involvement while maintaining democracy as a core value in Colombia society and governance.
