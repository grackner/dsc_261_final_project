In a surprising move today at CBS Studios in New York City, long-time showrunner Peter Noah announced that he will step down from his role on "The Big Bang Theory," the popular sitcom which has been running since its pilot episode first aired back in September of 2007. The news shocked fans across social media and left many eagerly anticipating what this change might mean for future seasons, as Noah was an instrumental part of bringing "The Big Bang Theory" to the hearts (and laughings) of millions worldwide over eight successful years before departing last fall after a record-setting 12th season.

Speaking about his decision at CBS Studios today in New York City, where he has worked since taking on the showrunner position seven seasons ago, Noah shared that while it is an exciting time for him personally to pursue other creative ventures and opportunities outside of television, this journey was not without its challenges. 

"It's always been a roller coaster," he admitted with both laughter and sincerity in his voice. "But I have left the show on sound foundations that we can continue to build upon." Noah continued by expressing gratitude towards his dedicated cast, crew, and fans for their unwavering support throughout eight seasons of crafting each episode's storyline as a labor of love despite occasional writer’s strikes and other industry hurdles.

"I have nothing but admiration and respect for the showrunners who came before me; it takes an enormous amount of skill to lead such talented writers and directors," commented Emmy Award-winning actress Maya Rudolph, known best for her role on "Saturday Night Live." As one half of Sheldon's love interest couple with Christensen played by Melissa Rauch on the CBS sitcom, she echoed Noah’s sentiment about his team and said: “The legacy Peter built here is something we can all be proud to carry forward. We owe them so much.”

No one quite knows what next steps are for "The Big Bang Theory." Will there still be a 13th season? How will the series continue after Noah's departure, and how might new showrunner Simon Carstairs contribute his touch of humor to future episodes without diluting beloved character traits that many fans have come to love so much over eight seasons with them as Sheldon, Leonard, Howard, Rajesh Koothrappali (the awkward introverted scientist), and Bernadette Rostenkowski-Waldowski?

In the meantime, CBS is already in talks on securing a new showrunner to ensure that this longtime favorite continues its legacy of entertaining comedy. According to multiple industry insiders close by who have been briefed about these developments ahead of official confirmation from CBS later today or tomorrow afternoon/evening at the earliest, one name is already rumored as Simon Carstairs - a writer and former showrunner for shows like "Parks and Recreation," which was also set in New York City.

Sources say that while his work has been lauded by both critics and audiences alike with its mix of sophisticated humor, heartfelt storytelling, as well as a sharp focus on relationships between characters (something fans have come to appreciate most), one might wonder how the transition will go from Noah's world where Sheldon is often set apart by
