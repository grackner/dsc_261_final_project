A fierce winter storm has hit Chicago overnight, causing significant disruppertion across suburban areas and major transportation hubs in the city as of Monday morning according to local authorities. The National Weather Service issued a blizzard warning from Friday night through today with warnings that temperatures will plummet below freezing while heavy snowfall is expected for well over 12 hours, potentially reaching up to three feet per day by some forecasts (Chicago Bureau of Emergency Management and Homeland Security).


Mayor Lori Lightfoot confirmed the severity in a statement on Friday night: "We are bracing ourselves against an unprecedented storm. Our city will face challenges, but our resilience is as strong as ever." The Chicago Department of Transportation has already closed major roads and set out snowplows to keep streets passable during the emergency declaration period stretching through tomorrow evening (Chicago Transit Authority).


In response, city officials urged residents to stay indoors with ample supplies due to risks associated with driving on icy surfaces. Amidst concerns for stranded passengers and those in need of medical attention or shelter from the storm's aftermath, a network of warming centers has been established throughout affected neighborhoods (Chicago Homeless Services Coalition).


"I had to leave my car behind," said Emily Davis, who lives on the west side but managed to find safe accommodation. "The city did what they could; I was touched by their concern for us." 


Residents and tourists alike have been advised that all flights into O'Hare International Airport are canceled indefinitely, while public transit options like buses and trains will run on a reduced schedule with service prioritizing critical routes to emergency services. Local hospitals reported preparedness for an influx of weather-related injuries or complications (Chicago Department of Public Health).


As the storm progresses, community support networks have been mobilized in various neighborhoods across Chicago by local NGO's like "Hearts As One" to provide food and resources. The city council is scheduled for an emergency meeting today at 4pm where plans for ongoing assistance are being formulated (Chicago City Council).
