In a surprising turn of events during last night's tight presidential election in Newlandia, Democrat Jane Doe and incumbent Republican John Roe went head-to-head with the difference between them shrinking to under two points as we speak after thousands flocked to early voting stations across various counties.

"This race has never been easy," said local councilor Michael Brown who worked tirelessly on both campaign trails in his own district, speaking candidly about how every vote can make a difference even late into election night (November 8). "I encourage everyone to exercise their right and participate whichever way they feel aligned with."

According to unofficial results shared by county supervisors on November 9th around midday, John Roe held an initial lead of just over five percentage points. However, as the night progressed into a more suspenseful scenario that would keep Newlandia citizens glued to their television screens and radios for hours ahead until all precincts had reported by midnight on election day (November 9).

"The race is tighter than we initially anticipated," said Election Commissioner, Sarah Wilson. "These numbers indicate that the people of Newlandia have turned out in record numbers."

As results rolled in from several counties around the state with tight margins seen across rural districts and suburban towns, political analysts warned about a potential recount due to how close these votes were coming down. "Given this closeness," stated University of Newlandia Political Science Professor Andrew Green, who has followed many elections throughout his academic career in politics at the state's capital city (November 9).

"I believe there are strong feelings on both sides about whether or not a recount should be initiated. It will surely bring us all closer to understanding where exactly we stand as Newlandia moves forward."
