A Hollywood producer has come under fire for allegedly making disparaging remarks towards female co-workers at a film set in Los Angeles last month. The incident occurred amidst the production of an upcoming big-budget action movie, "Thunder Rampage," and involved director John Harris, writer Lisa Thompson, casting agent Mark Evans, makeup artist Anna Rodriguez, and producer Sarah Bennett.

The alleged comments were made during a heated discussion about casting choices on set last month, according to two anonymous sources close to the matter who confirmed speaking with an employee from within the production team as well as witnesses present at various scenes of filming that took place over several weeks leading up to March 20th. One source says Harris remarked "why hire those girls for such roles when they can't even handle tough situations on set?" The sources add another comment, according to the same person was made by Evans: “If only we could find a girl who didn’t scream in terror during fight scenes." 

The comments have sparked outrage from actors and directors across the country as well as industry insiders calling for an end to gender discrimination on set. "It's disappointing that such behavior still exists within our own ranks," said acclaimed director Robert Smith, who worked with Harris in previous projects but was not involved this time around. 

Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department spokeswoman Lisa Johnson confirmed an investigation has been launched into the incident and assured: "We are treating all allegations seriously." The case is now under review by legal counsel for ABC Studios, which acquired “Thunder Rampage” earlier this year. A statement released today from a company representative read in part, “The healthy working environment we strive to foster does not tolerate misconduct of any kind.”

ABC executives have since announced they are reviewing all aspects related to the film's production and hope their actions will send "a clear message" that gender discrimination has no place in Hollywood. The studio is currently working with third-party consultants specializing in diversity training, reports one source who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Sarah Bennett was approached by the ABC legal team yesterday for a statement regarding her role as producer and to address these allegations head-on; however, she has not yet issued any formal comments while under review. Thompson also declined comment when asked about what transpired on set in an interview with "Variety" published last week stating that “I will always stand by my team’s ability.”

CNN and DailyMail reporters have reached out to all involved parties for official statements but as of this writing no comments or responses were provided.
