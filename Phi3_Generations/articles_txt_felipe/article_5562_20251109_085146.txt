A major earthquake struck southern China on Thursday afternoon with a preliminary magnitude of 7.3, according to early readings by seismic monitors stationed in the quake's epicenter near Ganzhou city and neighboring Zhangye City. Witnesses reported that tremors were felt as far away as Beijing more than two thousand miles to the northwest of the impact zone, which includes parts of southeener China like Guangdong Province.

The National Earthquake Disaster Management Agency confirmed initial reports and added that around 40 aftershocks have been registered in nearby areas since Thursday's quake struck at approximately 2:30 PM local time, with the strongest one having a preliminary magnitude of just over 5. A spokesperson for SEMA said more accurate readings are still being collated by specialist teams dispatched to Ganzhou and nearby regions as part of their immediate response efforts aiming at both assessing the initial damage done, providing urgent relief aid including food, water, blankets etc., and helping in evacuating people from affected communities.

The quake is among several major earthquakes recorded globally this year - most recently a 6.8-magnitude temblor that hit New Zealand on September 2nd was reported to have caused minor damage but no casualties while the worst disaster in Mexico's history took place earlier this month when two powerful quakes shook an offshore area near Chiapas state causing widespread devastation with thousands of fatalities and displacing hundreds more. 

However, unlike those catastrophic natural calamities which affected mainly remote regions in these countries without access to timely support or efficient disaster response systems, experts express confidence that quick action by Chinese authorities will mitigate the potential for loss-of-life here due largely because seismologists warn residents ahead of time and strict building codes designed specifically with earthquakes in mind. 

Dr Lisa Chan, Associate Professor at Hong Kong Baptist University School of Information Studies says that 'Earthquakes are natural disasters beyond our control but China has managed to keep fatalities low through early warnings based on historical patterns coupled with rigorous safety measures.' The mainland Chinese media have reported about 250 homes being damaged by the quake, and while nobody was instantly killed or seriously injured due to timely evacuation orders issued hours beforehand after predictions of imminent seismic activity had been made based on historical patterns combined with real-time sensor readings; this doesn't necessarily rule out potential risk for loss of life in the immediate future as more powerful tremors could follow.

Soldiers, emergency crews and volunteers have already begun to fan out across Ganzhou City carrying aid supplies such as food packs with rice (5kg each), bottled water tinsets weighing about 1 kg full of purified H2O per tinset-a total package that can feed an average family for three days, blankets and warm clothes.

SEMA's spokesperson commented: 'As the situation remains dynamic due to potential aftershock activity still forecasted by seismologists in coming hours or even days; we will continue our ongoing relief efforts including providing medical assistance until all affected families are safe and back home.'
