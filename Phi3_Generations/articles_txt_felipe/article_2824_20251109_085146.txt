In a dramatic escalation of violence in Gaza City today, multiple rockets launched by Palestinian militants were intercepted within minutes following their launch from an undisclosed location on the border with Israel around noon local time (2 PM EST). The rocket attacks prompted a military response that included live ammunition and air strikes against reported terrorist positions. No casualties have been confirmed thus far, but several dozen people are being treated for mild to moderate injuries at nearby medical facilities.

The Palestinian Authority has repeatedly denied any intentions of launching rocket attacks targeted toward Israel or Israeli civiliseluke-January 10th in Gaza City, where militant groups have launched multiple rockets towards the border with Israel as tensions escalate between both sides.

"The situation is becoming increasingly dangerous," says Dr. Iman Abdelrazek, Director of Public Health at Al Shifa Hospital on Wednesday morning (January 10th). "We have seen a steady rise in injuries since the beginning of this conflict and are stretched thin with patients."

An Israeli official issued a stern warning earlier today: military action will continue until stability is restored. While Palestinian officials deny responsibility for these attacks, local witnesses tell CNN they saw groups armed with shoulder-launched missiles as militants took cover in residential areas and abandoned homes around Gaza City Wednesday morning (January 10th).

"I heard explosions coming from a few houses down; there were people rushing out of their apartments screaming," says Ahmed al-Zu'bi, who lives just off the coast near Tel Aviv. "There was smoke everywhere and glass breaking."

Israeli forces have been targeted several times in recent weeks with rockets fired from Gaza City towards Israeli cities such as Ashkelon to the west (approx 5 km) or Be'er Sheva, also about 8 miles away on average. In turn, Israel has responded by launching airstrikes and artillery fire into Palestinian territories in recent days - including rockets fired towards targets inside Gaza City today itself after militants launched several projectiles early Wednesday morning (January 10th).

According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, at least six civilians have been reported dead and more than two dozen injured by rocket fire in Gaza City this week. Residents fear they will soon be on their own if both sides continue fighting without ceasefire agreements being reached - a prospect that appears increasingly likely as leaders of each side trade accusations while military forces mobilize for possible further confrontation today (January 10th).

The Israeli Army has deployed additional troops along the border with Gaza City and launched numerous drone strikes overnight. Palestinian security officials, meanwhile, have banned gatherings in open spaces such as markets or mosques amid fears they could be targeted by militants taking cover among civilians during periods of intense fighting like this one we're witnessing today (January 10th).

"Our first priority is keeping our people safe," says Abdelbaset Hussein, a Gaza City resident who fled his home following last night’s rocket attack. "We want peace and stability for ourselves but it seems
