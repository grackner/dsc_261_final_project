A local soccer academy in Riverside was evacuated today due to safety concerns amidst ongoing renovations at their facility near Central Park Plaza. The incident occurred shortly before the afternoon match between two prominent youth teams, which has been postponed as of this writing until further notice. 

The Riverdale Soccer Academy had announced plans for extensive remodeling last month with hopes to expand its indoor training spaces and improve seating capacity within their main auditorium by April next year - a project aimed at providing better resources for the youth in Riverside community who show exceptional soccer talent.

However, unforeseen delays have left equipment strewn about on one of the pitches since last Thursday evening during practice sessions when workers were not present to clear away materials from recent construction within and surrounding the academy grounds. The accumulation has reportedly gone mostly unnoticed due to scheduling coincidences, but today's match took place just as parents arrived for spectating duty; one of them stepped on a misplaced piece causing her daughter Emma Smith to slip and fall heavily onto an adjacent goalkeeper netting - the incident prompting immediate evacuation.

Academy director Maria Gonzalete expressed regret about this occurrence, "We apologize unreservedly for our oversight that led to such a mishap today; safety is always of utmost importance and we will address every aspect diligently moving forward." Riverside Fire Department Chief Pete Rodriguez added reassurances after confirming no serious injuries, stating: "While Emma did break her arm this afternoon, she's currently receiving the necessary care here at St. Mary’s Hospital; our team is on site to support any of their loved ones."

As a preventive measure following today's event and in response to concerns raised by parents about safety during renovations near soccer grounds being used for regular practice, Riverdale Soccer Academy has pledged increased security measures at all times. Work will be halted on the construction site until proper barriers are erected between work areas and pitches as well additional temporary fencing around perimeter of academy which is scheduled to begin next weekend after consulting with both Riverside Building Contractors Association (RBCA) and Safety Council - an effort endorsed by Soccer United States Regional Director James Carter, who commented: "Safety protocols are essential in ensuring our players can continue training without hindrance or fear of injury; we urge all organizations to prioritize these measures especially during construction."

Riverdale's youth soccer league officials also announced plans for more frequent safety checks as well as a review session with parents and guardians, which is expected next week. In the meantime Riverside High School’s Soccer Club will take over hosting afternoon matches to allow Riverdale Academy some much-needed time off from their ongoing renovations until completion of security measures are in place.
