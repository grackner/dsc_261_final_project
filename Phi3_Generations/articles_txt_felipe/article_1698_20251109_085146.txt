Investors watched with bated breath yesterday as a chain reaction sent shares plummeting on trading floors across Asia Pacific. Experts point to the sudden surge of tech sell-offs from major Chinese firms linked directly back to Shanghai's booming semiconductor market, which is undergoing significant turmoil following several regulatory decisions in recent weeks that have left investors concerned about a possible credit crunch.
Shanghai Securities Exchange Authority announced an immediate halt of tech trading from the city at 10am local time yesterday due to unspecified "market irregularities." Within hours, stock markets across Asia Pacific felt repercussions as shares dropped by upwards of 7% in Tokyo and Singapore. As panic spread among investors fearful about a financial bubble bursting wide open or potential national economic downturns rippling through to the rest of Asia-Pacific, stock markets experienced volatility that has not been seen since early last year's tech sell-off wave.
"Today will be one for the record books," said Michael Wong, a Hong Kong market analyst and senior consultant at Financial Vision Group in mainland China as he surveyed trading floors across Asia Pacific yesterday afternoon after working overtime to monitor developments on his screens with colleagues. "The impact of what happened here will be felt throughout the region's markets for a long time."
Shares from several Chinese tech companies, including industry giants Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., Tencent Holdings Ltd., and Huawei Technologies Co., fell dramatically in Shanghai before trading stopped completely yesterday afternoon. The sudden drop began after the securities exchange reported a large-scale liquidation event involving several smaller tech firms with links to major players, who have been increasingly scrutinized by authorities over their market dominance and potential monopolistic behavior — actions that led regulators in Beijing last week to introduce new policies restricting the sector.
These moves triggered a significant sell-off of shares among tech companies across Asia Pacific as uncertainty spread into neighbor countries fearful about falling dominoes or being next on target for crackdowns themselves, with Japan's Nikkei 225 stock market recording its steepest drop since last year.
"The news out today really rocked the markets," said one banker in Tokyo yesterday afternoon when asked to comment anonymously about developments happening outside of their trading floor as they grappled with how to react amidst investor panic and massive sell orders coming from clients wanting quick returns on holdings. "I've never seen anything like this before, where everything just seemed so interconnected across the region."
