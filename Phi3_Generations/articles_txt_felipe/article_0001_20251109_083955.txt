Australia has witnessed its highest recorded water usage ever in recent years due to a record-breaking heatwave and drought conditions across multiple states. As of August this year, the nation is grappling with an unprecedented demand for freshwater as reservoirs are at their lowest levels since records began being kept 60 years ago. This comes amid reports that many major cities could face severe water restrictions or even potential blackouts within months if measures aren't taken soon to conserve the remaining supply, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne.

The situation is most acute in New South Wales (NSW), where temperatures are expected to soar above 40°C for upcoming weeks with little hope of rain on the horizon. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology predicts a 'long drought that could last well into next year.' With dams and reservoir levels at historic lows, authorities have warned Australians not to waste any water as restrictions are about to become mandatory unless consumers take immediate steps toward conservation.

Residents in Sydney alone used 10% more than the previous month despite pleas for moderation from local governments and experts who fear that without urgent action, life-threatening emergency measures will soon be needed to ensure there's enough water for essential services such as hospitals.

"It feels like a 'drought in an era of plenty,' said Tony Waleed Mohamed from the WaterWise Alliance, who has worked on sustainability issues since working with Sydney Harbour Trust during drought crises between 2017 and 2020," he told AFP News Agency. "The fact that this is happening while we are in a time when many people think climate change discussions have died off or not been talked about shows just how far we still have to go."

Mohamed said more than two-thirds of Sydney's water comes from dams, but even the most efficient urban areas like Parramatta and Campbelltown consume upwards of 35 litres per person daily - which could drop down as low as eight in a few months. "If we can get below that number quickly by cutting back on usage at home – taking shorter showers or only watering the garden when necessary, for instance–we might avoid harsher restrictions and blackouts," he said.

Melbourne is also feeling this pressure; with its reservoirs down to just 40% capacity amid an extended dry spell since September last year that's forecast not to end until late next month by the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM). Melbourne Water Director, Sarah Haynes told CNN Australia: "We are on track for a historically poor rainfall season and with dam levels at just 37%, this has been one of our driest years since records began in 1896."

"It's clear that we need to act now before it is too late," Haynes said, adding: "We are working hard on conservation campaigns across the city. This includes encouraging residents and businesses alike; every drop saved here will help us get through this critical time while ensuring a stable water supply for future generations."

CNN has learned that some parts of Victoria have already imposed stringent measures, such as banning all non-essential outdoor activity which require water use and closing car washes entirely. Sydney City Council is contemplating similar actions if there isn't significant rainfall in
