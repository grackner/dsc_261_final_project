As Major League Baseball prepares for its next home series between May and June at Fenway Park in Boston, there is growing anticipation over a breakthrough that could significantly impact how the sport approaches player performance tracking: wearable technology specifically designed to monitor pitchers' arm health and workload. This news comes after months of rumors about technological innovations aimed at reducing injury risks among MLB players—especially young, elite prospects entering high-stakes seasons each year.

MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred praised the potential impact this new tool could have on player safety and overall health: "As we move forward with incorporating advanced technologies into our game, safeguarding our athletes becomes a top priority," he said during an interview last week at Citi Field in Queens. 

The device itself—the Athlete Performance Monitoring System (APMS) developed by Boston-based start-up Pitcher Analytics Inc.—has been tested over the past year on players across various levels of competition, from local semipro teams to major league starters like Red Sox pitcher Eduardo Rodriguez. While not intended for everyday use just yet and still in its final testing stages before wider adoption within MLB's clubhouse offices around June 20th this year, APMS has already demonstrated promising results when it comes to measuring arm torque—a key indicator of potential strain that can lead to injury.

As for how exactly the new device works and what makes its sensors so precise: Dr. David Pappas, director of Sports Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital who helped oversee some initial trials with APMS earlier this year explains in detail via phone call last night (Tuesday), "This system utilizes a network of small accelerometers—essentially miniature gyroscopes embedded within specialized gloves pitchers wear when throwing practice or warm-up sessions. The sensors measure minute movements and forces experienced by the arm, providing real-time feedback via earphones worn during each throw."

While some might view this as intrusive surveillinan gear on a player's body—especially pitchers not yet accustomed to their new glove ensemble that includes built-in sensors and Bluetooth connectivity (more info here)-, Dr. Pappas emphasizes the system is lightweight at only about five ounces per device: "Our goal with APMS has always been player comfort as well," he adds reassuringly during a recent interview alongside Boston Red Sox pitcher Eduardo Rodriguez who recently participated in trials using this cutting-edge technology.

And so far, the results seem impressive among those tested—and already being implemented by organizations like Toronto Blue Jays and Pittsburgh Pirates scouting departments since late February of 2019: "I've seen significant improvements myself with these devices helping me understand how hard I was throwing," Rodriguez says candidly during an interview last week after attending a two-day seminar on best practices for utilizing APMS at Fenway Park.

But there remains some uncertainty over the device among those still learning about it: "I've heard concerns from older guys—they say they can feel these little devices all up and down their arms, sometimes even in the gloves themselves," adds Rodriguez as we sit inside a dugout at Fenway Park. He pauses to add thoughtfully before continuing after taking off his glasses briefly: "
