A groundbredependent treatment for multiple sclerosis shows promise in a clinical trial held at Johns Hopkins University Hospital on April 12th, with initial findings suggesting reduced relapse rates and slower disease progression among participants living in the northeast region of Baltimore. The double-blind study involved over two hundred individuals diagnosed within six months prior to their enrollment between January and March this year.


"We are encouraged by these early results," says Dr. Sarah Thompson, lead researcher on the project. "The potential for regenerative medicine in neurological disorders is immense." 


In multiple sclerosis (MS), a person's immune system attacks their protective covering of nerve fibers—myelin—which causes communication problems between the brain and the rest of the body. Currently, there are treatments that can manage symptoms but not cure MS; however, this study tested GroundBased Myelin Regeneration (GBMR), a novel therapy involving harvested stem cells from patients who have achieved remission after previous successful treatment with established methods like corticosteroids or immunotherapies.


"These individuals' own myelination potential is unlike anything we’ve seen before," states Dr. Thompson, referring to the ability of these specialized regenerative cells from patients who have achieved long-term remission under current MS treatments to promote nerve fiber recovery in new host environments - a process termed allografting by the research team here at Johns Hopkins University Hospital.


Clinical trial participants experienced varying degrees of success, with some reporting minor improvements while others noted substantial progress, particularly when compared against standard treatments like Interferon-beta or Glatiramer Acetate which offer symptomatic relief but have not historically shown to regenerate lost myelin. Participants received the allograft once every three months for a year and were then observed over an extended follow-up period of two years with periodic MRI scans to assess any changes in brain lesions typically associated with MS.


Johns Hopkins University has filed a patent pending application on GBMR, which if approved following additional study phases could revolutionize the approach towards treating not only multiple sclerosis but also other demyelinating diseases such as neuromyelitis optica and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. The research team aims to expand trials internationally, seeking FDA approval for widespread clinical application pending further study outcomes that continue the promising trajectory of this innovative treatment approach in managing neurodegenerative conditions associated with demyelinating processes throughout human history and scientific inquiry.
