In a stunning revelation that has taken flight experts by surprise, investigators have identified and deactivated what appears to be an unauthorized GPS tracker being used on commercial aircraft over the past six months. The covert devices were found hidden in various locations abo ends of planes flying internationally between January 2019 and June 2019, with most discoveries reported from U.S., European, and Asian airports worldwide including major hubs like Heathrow Airport (London), Charles de Gaulle Airport (Paris), and Haneda Airport (Tokyo). The FAA has issued a statement confirming the detection of these devices during routine inspections in cooperation with local law enforcement agencies, expressing concern over this alarming security breach.

"These unauthorized GPS trackers pose significant risks to flight safety and passenger privacy," said FAA spokesperson John Doe at a press conference today (July 3). "It's imperative that we work together with all stakeholders, including passengers, airlines, security agencies across the world. We need everyone on board in our continuous efforts to enhance aviation safety."

An international investigation led by Interpol has since identified a list of individuals linked to some 30 cases wherein unauthorized devices were spotted inside aircrafts; their identities and reasons remain undisclosed, as investigations are still ongoing. While these activities raise legitimate security concerns for authorities worldwide – the potential misuse could be anything from espionage or surveillance to terrorism threats – passenger reactions towards this issue vary widely across countries where such cases have been reported recently; some believe it a mere overreaction, while others argue that safety should never take precedence.

Maria Gonzalez - Senior Systems Engineer at American Airlines and member of the International Air Transport Association's Safety Committee – emphasized these concerns by saying during an aviation security forum last weekend: "In today’s world where technology is advancing rapidly, we need to ensure all necessary precautions are in place. Unauthorized tracking devices pose potential risks that must be dealt with immediately and decisively."

The FAA spokesperson continued explaining at the press conference how they discovered most of these GPS trackers by chance during routine inspections, stating: "It's not uncommon for us to find foreign objects inside aircraft cabins. The key here is identifying a pattern that raises suspicion."

He further explained about their collaboration with local law enforcement agencies across the globe in detecting such security threats aboard flights and at airports worldwide: "We have strong working relationships with aviation authorities, customs officers around the world. We share information openly as much as possible to keep our skies safe for all passengers."

Following today's press conference by FAA spokesperson John Doe who highlighted this issue severely and urged international collaboration among airlines globally in tackling these unauthorized devices, there is an immediate call from various industry leaders to review security measures within commercial aviation. 

Airline CEO Jane Smith said: "While we understand that every passenger has their own set of priorities when flying and not all may agree on the severity of this situation - let's remember, our primary concern is always safety." She further added about her company
