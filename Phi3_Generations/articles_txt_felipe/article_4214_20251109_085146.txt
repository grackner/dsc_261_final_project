An investigation into allegations of voter suppression has prompted a state election board to order an audit for all votes cast in last month's midterm elections across ten precincts where irregularities were reported, CNN reports the decision was made on Tuesday night. The findings from this comprehensive review are expected within two weeks and will involve examining ballots, paper trails, voting machine logs, as well as interviewing hundreds of voters who claimed they faced hurdles when casting their vote in various counties across the state.

"It's essential that we restore public confidence by conducting a thorough investigation," said Jane Doe, chairwoman of State Election Board during Tuesday evening session where this decision was announced to reporters and gathered interested members of Congress hailing from both parties seeking clarity on the matter. "We need impartial results for transparency."

CNN has learned that these allegations were initially brought forth by several voters who claimed they encountered difficulties in obtaining their mail-in ballots or found certain provisions during physical voting at polling stations unclear leading to potential misinterpretation of the election rules. These concerns have been echoed across multiple counties and resulted from both early primary elections held on March 15th, as well as general midterm elections conducted a month later on October 3rd in several districts within our state: namely Adams County (precincts A-D), Benton County's Wise Town area comprising precincts E–G and Fenton City’s Precinct I with the rest of its county being inspected for irregularities.

Members from both Republican and Democrat parties in Congress have expressed their concerns about potential suppression tactics disrupting democracy, stating that "it's paramount to address these issues head-on". State Senator John Smith also voiced his support saying: “As elected representatives it’s our duty towards ensuring equal representation. We must not allow fear or division hinder us in safeguarding the integrity of this process."

The Board announced its plan on Tuesday night to hold meetings with local election officials, community leaders and advocacy groups as part of their investigation into these reports across different counties within our state where allegations were first reported back during last month's midterm elections. Aside from seeking clarification about the identified concerns at polling places nationwide according to several witnesses who stepped forward after experiencing difficulties on Election Day, there have been no admissions of misconduct or direct accusations towards any party involved so far as per press releases issued by both parties' election committees.

"The integrity of our democracy is non-negotiable," added Chairwoman Doe during Tuesday evening session where she announced the decision to order an audit across ten precincts after reviewing multiple reports and concerns brought forth by voters themselves regarding difficulties they encountered while trying to cast their vote in various counties around our state. The Board is committed to ensuring a fair, transparent process for all citizens who exercise this fundamental right."

Members of Congress representing districts within the ten precincts are urging constituents and fellow officials alike "to hold accountable any individuals or entities found guilty through impartial investigation". Meanwhile, local election boards have been requested to improve communication channels with voters for future elections. The final report from this audit is expected on December 29th when the Board will convene before Congress where findings and possible recommendations
