Topic: Health - Mindfulness

After years of research and growing evidence supporting its benefits for mental well-bestatic health, mindfulness is now being widely recommended by doctors around the world as a valuable complement to traditional treatments in dealing with anxiety disorders such as PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder). Mindfulness practices involve present-moment awareness and acceptance of thoughts, feelings, bodily sensations without judgment.

Mindfulness meditation has been particularly effective for veterans suffering from PTSD; a study conducted at the VA (Veteran Affairs) medical center in Seattle found that after 8 weeks of mindfulness training combined with standard therapy and medication, patients reported significant improvements not only on their symptoms but also overall life satisfaction.

"Mindfulness has helped many veterans open up about traumatic experiences they previously kept hidden," said Dr. Susan Roberts, a psychologist at the VA center who supervised the mindfulness meditation program in Seattle for two years before expanding it nationwide as part of her post-doctoral research with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). "Mindful techniques enable them to confront those traumas rather than suppress or run away from their pain."

In 2017, an HHS report revealed that about one in three adults had experienced a mental disorder at some point in the past year. With depression costing America $26 billion annually and suicide rates on track to surpass those of firearm death, mindfulness seems like it may be more important now than ever before for both individual well-being as well society's economic health.

Roberts attributes her success with teaching PTSD patients how to deal constructively with their trauma through meditation techniques she learned from Yi Iyengar, one of the first American psychologists and yoga teacher who specialized in working directly with veterans suffering symptoms like dissociation.

"I found that traditional talk therapy methods alone weren't sufficient to help many patients achieve a sense of control over their anxiety," said Iyengar, whose books such as The Science Behind Yoga: How Mindfulness and Breath Control Teach the Brain To Heal Itself are widely used by veterans across America. "The best way for these men and women to regain that sense of control is through meditation."

In fact Roberts's mindful therapy program has been replicated at medical centers nationwide with similar results, including the VA in San Diego where more than 30 veterans participated in her eight-week study. Although many patients experienced improvements as soon as they started to attend group meditation sessions and learn breath control techniques from Iyengar's books three times per week for an hour a session before bedtime, some needed additional support such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or psychiatric medications.

"Some veterans come in with severe PTSD that may be lifel0ting them to the brink of suicide," Roberts said at VA hospital where one 38-years old former Army corporal who had been suffering from trauma for two years before enrolling was finally able, through mindfulness meditation and CBT along with medication prescribed by his doctor in Seattle's PTSD clinic to overcome intrusive thoughts. "If a veteran is experiencing panic attacks or flashback sympt
