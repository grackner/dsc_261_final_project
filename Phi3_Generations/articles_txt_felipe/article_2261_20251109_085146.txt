In a Hollywood blockbuster that has set tongues wagging and box office numbers to record highs this weekend, "The Eternal Quest" stars Tom Hiddleston alongside Charlize Theron as the dynamic duo embarks on an epic journey across continents. The film hit over 200 screens nationwide last Saturday with a debut gross of $5 million in ticket sales within just its first day, according to Box Office Mojo's tracking system.

"The Eternal Quest," directed by the visionary director Chris Weitz and written by acclaimed screenwriters Akiva Ginsenberg (known for his work on 'Zoolander') and Eric Kumges (famed writer from Australia), has been an instant hit amongst both critics and audienthy alike. With its release in 2D, IMAX, and Dolby Vision formats nationwide since Friday evening at numerous theaters across Los Angeles to New York City, it promises a visual spectacle that rivals anything seen on screen before this summer blockbuster hits international waters later this year with partnerships already lined up for world tours.

"We knew when we started shooting in Iceland and Spain back at the beginning of November 2018," says cinematographer Robert Richardson, who worked closely alongside director Chris Weitz on previous hit films such as 'Planes, Trains &amp;amp; Target Destruction.' "The goal was to create a visual feast that would transport audiences not just into the story but right inside these characters' hearts and minds - we want you feeling every emotion they feel."

In an exclusive interview with Rolling Stone ahead of 'The Eternal Quest''s release, Tom Hiddleston speaks candidly about his role as Dr. Alexei Petrovich Kovalyov: "I got to play someone who's been haunted by a ghost for years - he finds himself on an incredible journey full of danger and adventure that leads him across Europe." Charlize Theron plays the formidable Elara Delacourt, with whom Dr. Petrovich must unravel ancient secrets to save countless lives from imminent disasters in different parts of the world before time runs out for humanity itself - all while developing a unique bond amidst chaos and heartbreak throughout their quest together."

With an intricate plot that blends historical fiction, science-fiction elements with touches of romance set against breathtakingly beautiful landscapes shot in locations like Reykjavik's golden sands; Barcelona’s Gothic Quarter echoing tales from centuries past where the film delves into mysteries buried deep within our world history and mythology, 'The Eternal Quest'' has earned rave reviews for its strong performances by Theron (who won critical acclaim at age 39), Hiddleston as well as other key players like Jake Gyllensten playing Viking guard Magnus Eriksson; Emma Thompson portrays Queen Isabella I of Spain.

Critics rave about the chemistry between lead actors, with praise particularly noting how Theron's character stands out from others in similar films and her ability to convey complex emotions through subtle expressions alone - as one critic puts it: "Charlize is nothing short than magnetic; when she walks on screen or speaks a word – you just can feel that there isn’t anything else around."
