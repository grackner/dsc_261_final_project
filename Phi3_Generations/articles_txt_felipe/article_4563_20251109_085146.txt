Sacramento's local high school hockey team has made history with a stunning upset victory over California State University on Friday night in Folsom at the Ice Palace Arena. The Sacramentans, who have only reached this stage of play two times before and never managed to secure an outright win against college players—despite showing remarkable skill as underdogs—earned a hard-fought 3-2 victory thanks to relentless efforts from their goalie and defensive line.

The game, which drew in over ten thousand fans for the local community event on March 14th at Folsom's Ice Palace Arena, began with both teams displaying an equal level of skill but quickly shifted when Sacramento managed to score a power-play goal within their first minute into play. Despite this early lead by Cal Poly’s defense and goaltender Kyle Brodie setting the tone for what would be tense competition throughout the night, Sacramentans never faltered with steady scoring from star player Alex Carter in each quarter of play that led to an unyielding performance through full time.

"I've played against Cal Poly many times before and always felt we had a chance at winning," said coach Mike Johnson following his team’s triumph, “We just needed the belief today.” The Sacramentans came from behind by taking two early goals within their first 20 minutes of play but were held scoreless for over ten additional minutes with Cal Poly dominating possession. In those moments when neither side could score directly on goal though, both teams attempted to create offense through puck transfers and rattling the boards instead.

As Sacramento began regaining control around halfway point of play-time at 23:47 after leading by only one a few minutes prior during said period when their lead was just two goals with ten more to come from Cal Poly, senior defenceman John Richter felt the weight on his shoulders as he spoke about what made this particular game different. “I remember thinking last year’s defeat must have been difficult for some of our players,” commented Richter while being interviewed afterwards by an eager reporter at a nearby press conference after games ended, "but I think we all learned from it and that's why today feels so great."

In their first period offensive attempts came just before halftime when senior forward Emma Lewis delivered the game-tying goal in 45 minutes of playtime. As her teammates celebrated with high fives, joyful laughter could be heard throughout as Sacramento took control after this event and maintained a one point lead through three quarters at full time mark before taking it home late into overtime by scoring once more on the power-play that followed shortly afterwards from Carter himself.

Senior goaltender Tom Davis, who was credited with stopping 28 of Cal Poly’s shots in just under an hour and a half while Sacramentans managed to score all three goals for their team during said period—making his performance stand out as unparalleled throughout this season thus far.

“Today showed us how hard work really does pay off,” Davis commented after the game, “It's nice to see what we can accomplish when our focus is on one goal and not just trying too much.”
