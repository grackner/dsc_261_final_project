India recorded a dramatic rise in cases of Delta variant COVID-19 with new numbers emerging from rural and urban areas alike on Monday as public health experts warn that the country is at risk of losing control over its surge amid concerns about vaccine hesitty. The Ministry of Health's latest data reflect a worrying 50% increase in cases compared to last week, with Maharashtra and West Bengal states being hardest hit - as per reports from the New Delhi office on Thursday evening (Monday).

Health officials say that while more than half of India's population has received their first dose at 67%, a mere quarter is fully vaccinated, and experts suggest this discrepancy could be contributing to the rapid spread. "We cannot underestimate how crucial it is for all adult citizens to get both shots in arms," says Dr Rakesh Gupta, an epidemiologist at Delhi's All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).

The Delta variant was first identified here last September and has since been the primary cause behind numerous outbreak clusters. Officials are particularly concerned with cases surging in crowded markets across New Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad, Lucknow, Ahmedabad, Patna, Nagpur, and Pune - areas where populations tend to be dense.

"COVID-19 is highly contagious but with a little precautionary effort on our part we can manage the situation better," says local resident Neha Sinha in New Delhi's Dilli Haat marketplace yesterday, as she continues her daily routine after receiving both doses of vaccine.

India is yet to impose strict lockdown measures like previous waves but has enforced night curfew hours and limited mobility for non-essential work from May 20 till July 31. The country, however, continues its massive COVID-19 inoculation program with over three million doses administered daily across multiple vaccination centers nationwide since late January when the drive began rolling out locally produced Covishield (Oxford/AstraZeneca) and recently imported Pfizer.

Experts believe India's public health infrastructure could handle another surge with proper precautionary measures in place, especially if case spikes do not cross critical thresholds which would put hospitals under severe strain - as happened during the second wave last year when 30% of beds were occupied by COVID-19 patients.

"Hospitals need to maintain a reserve capacity for emergencies, and we must ensure that public health protocols are adhered to diligently," says Dr Gupta at AIIMS Delhi while stressing the importance of vaccination as India's government ramps up efforts amid concerns about growing hesitancy.

The Ministry is reportedly considering introducing COVID-19 specific policies which may include booster doses for high risk individuals - a move that could bolster immunity levels in critical sections such as health workers, the elderly and people with comorbidities who are at increased chances of severe illness.

"Boosters will help bridge any gaps left by existing vaccinations," says Dr Gupta adding it's vital to continue regular monitoring for potential breakthrough in
