A breakthrough in desalination technology has been unveiled at a research facility located near San Diego this weekend. Scientists have successfully developed a low-cost method to purify seawater using renewable energy, with the process expected to significantly reduce fresh water scarcity issues worldwide by next year.

Developed in collaboration between Caltech and University of California campuses, Dr. Angela Chen led an international team responsible for creating this innovative desalination technique that promises a more sustainable future for those living in drought-prone regions like Southern California which has seen below-average precipitation over the past decade.

"Despite our success here, we have miles ahead to ensure equal access and affordability across continents," said Dr. Chen while addressing reporters at a press conference last Thursday afternoon outside of her lab where they demonstrated their technology on-site before taking samples back for further testing in the university's labs located throughout Los Angeles County area including Pasadena, Long Beach and Anaheim - home to numerous desalination plants worldwide that are working tirelessly towards supplying clean water.

The process works by employing solar panels as energy sources which power a series of electrolytic cells capable of separating pure freshwater from salt-laden seawater using electrodialysis - an effective technique for desalination pioneered at Caltech back in 2015 and improved upon since then through collaboration with other universities such as MIT, Oxford among others.

"We believe that our technology will not only help mitigate water scarcity but also pave the way towards a greener future," said Dr. Chen during her speech before reporters last Thursday afternoon outside of Caltech's desalination research facility near San Diego where scientists unveiled their groundbreaking low-cost solution for providing clean drinking water to communities worldwide by 2025, while simultaneously addressing concerns raised about the environmental impact on marine life habitats and ecosystem.

The team of chemists working in California have been exploring ways to reduce costs associated with desalination plants through this new method which uses renewable energy sources as its primary power source instead of traditional fossil fuels that contribute significantly towards greenhouse gas emissions responsible for climate change according to NASA's findings over the past decade. 

In her press conference, Dr. Chen further explained how they plan on implementing this new technique globally stating "We aim to provide affordable clean water access even in remote villages where conventional methods are not feasible due to lack of infrastructure or high costs." She added that more research needed conducted before full-scale implementation could begin and acknowledged some potential challenges such as obtaining local government approvals, securing funding for expansion projects across developing nations.

Environmental experts have also voiced concern about the impact this new technology may pose on marine ecosystem health but Dr. Chen assured that extensive studies would be conducted before any plant installation begins in order to minimize potential harm while ensuring optimal water output quality suitable for human consumption - as per a study published earlier today by UCLA's Department of Environmental Science which examined the effects desalination processes have on marine ecosystems and found minimal impact when using modern techniques.

As news spread about this groundbreaking achievement, various organizations including UNICEF expressed interest in partnering with Caltech to provide clean water access across developing nations suffering from chronic
