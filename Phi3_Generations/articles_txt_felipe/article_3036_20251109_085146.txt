The final score was a close contender as it came down to extra time: Toronto Maple Leafs vs Boston Bruins, where Team A emerged victorious with a scoreline of 3-2 after an overtime session that lasted for nearly thirty minutes.

The New York Rangers' triumph against the Pittsburgh Penguins has sparked celebrations in Madison Square Garden as fans and players alike revel in their first Stanley Cup win since those memorable years of '14 to '19, when they secured three consecutive championships with a record four-goal lead.
