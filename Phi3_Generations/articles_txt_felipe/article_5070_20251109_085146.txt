Amid rising global tensions in international waters off Somalia's coast, a convoy of humanitarian aid ships was struck by pirates on Thursday night as it delivered food and medical supplies to the Mogadishu region. The hijacking occurred just after dusk when two small skiffs armed with automatic weapons emerged from concealed locations in southern Puntland, launching an assault on the convoy approximately 50 nautical miles northwest of Kismayo Port at around 10:45 PM local time.

Somali military officials confirmed that three foreign aid ships — each carrying thousands of food packages and medical supplies for impoverished communities in Mogadishu, Baidoa, and Dhobley towns within the country's southern half — were targeted by a coordinated attack involving at least six pirate skiffs. The hijacking was led by three Somali-born former U.S. Marines who had recently returned to their homeland after working in high security positions overseas and are believed to have gained experience with military tactics used against insurgents during conflicts such as those in Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, Libya, and Syria before turning their skills towards piracy.

The convoy had been escorted by a pair of Navy-operated helicopters flying from the Somali navy base at Berbera on April 20 when all communication ceased abruptly between ground support personnel and aircrews around dusk, reported witnesses who described eerie silence descending upon their vessels as they waited for reinforcements. After two minutes passed without warning or sign of the skiffs' approach from seemingly close proximity, chaos ensued when bullets struck at point-blank range followed by rapid fire shots into several lifeboats and dinghies carrying aid workers before all three ships were boarded within seconds.

According to local fisherman Mohamed Abdirahim Aden who claimed he spotted the attackers hiding in nearby mangroves, "We didn't see any sign of military craft on radar as we came closer but it was too dark for anyone else." The piracy-capable skiffs were small enough not to show up clearly from a distance yet robustly built with steel hulls and powerful engines. Experts say that they are often employed by organized crime groups who smuggle weapons, drugs, or contraband into Somalia's ungoverned territories where pirate attacks frequently occur due to corruption within government forces responsible for patrolling the waters surrounding Africa's largest nation with a lengthy coastline stretching nearly 3,000 kilometers (1864 miles) and overlapping maritime borders shared by neighbor countries Kenya and Ethiopia.

Somali President Mohamed Abdullahi Farmaajo condemned the attack in an urgent statement released shortly after intelligence teams located suspects who were linked to armed groups operating under Al-Shabaab's flag, which have carried out numerous kidnappings of aid workers or tourists passing through Mogadishu. "Our nation will never tolerate piracy that targets innocent lives and hijacks vital supplies meant for the people in need," said Farmaajo as he called upon international partners to join forces with his administration's military efforts against criminals who exploit Somalia's instability caused by decades of civil war, foreign interventions since 199
