Athletes and spectators at the Tokyo Olympic Games faced unexpected challenges when a tropical cyclone made landfall near Yokohama on July 15. The National Weather Service has warned of potentially severe weather, advising caution for all outdoor activities scheduled to take place over the following days in the area surrounding Makuhari Messe Exhibition Hall and Ariake Gymnastics Centre where several events are held.

Given that Japan is no stranger to natural calamities like earthquakes or tsunamis, many questioned if authorities would be able to adecurate measures for protecting the athletes' safety in case of a cyclone during such an important international event as the 2024 Summer Olympics.

In response to these concerns raised by various media outlets and citizens alike who attended or were going to attend Games-related events, Tokyo Organizing Committee spokesperson Kenji Kato stated: "We are taking this threat very seriously and have made arrangements for the safety of our guests." He added that all event schedules would be adapted accordingly.

According to meteorologists' reports delivered by Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), wind speeds could reach up to 130 kilometers per hour, with heavy rainfall and potential flooding expected across parts of Greater Tokyo including Ikebukuro Station where several marathon participants were heading.

Senior meteorologist at JMA Hiroshi Sato commented: "This cyclone is an unusual event for the region as it formed in the Indian Ocean, but with a combination of atmospheric and ocean temperatures that are higher than usual this year." He noted the need to remain vigilant until further notice.

Several sports organizers have been working tirelessly since yesterday morning developing contingency plans for all events happening at Makuhari Messe Exhibition Hall, Ariake Gymnastics Centre and other venues within a 10-kilometer radius of the city center to account for weather disruforts.

Organizers also arranged transportation services that would allow Olympic athletes and spectators safe evacuations should necessary. These measures came as several countries withdrew their delegations amid concerns about safety, though not without some backlash from fans who felt they were being unduly influenced by outside sources. However, the International Olympic Committee has since reaffirmed that no such withdrawals will be considered based on weather events alone but rather athletes' personal decisions after consulting with their respective national committees and coaches.

"We understand your concerns for safety," said Japan Gymnastics Association President Masao Tanaka, "but we want to assure you that all precautionary measures are being taken by the Organising Committee in line with our commitment as an Olympic host." He added: "It's not just about having games underway; it is also ensuring every participant can focus on their performance without worries, even if unexpected events arise along the way. The athletes we have here at Tokyo are nothing short of amazing!"

As a result, several prominent gymnastics nations including USA, China and Australia remain with full delegations while countries like Norway cancelled some participants citing concerns over travel safety to Japan in light of recent events elsewhere worldwide that saw hurricanes touch down. This comes after the IOC issued clarification earlier this week about how they would approach situations when natural disasters struck during a Games:
