A fire has destroyed a historic European Union headquarters in Brussels early Friday morning, with officials confirming more than one person is missing amidst chaotic evacuations of staff and tourists alike (Brussels Fire Brigade reports that the blaze started around 3am local time at the Europa building).

The fire engulfed a three-story section built in 2014, situated on Rue de la Loi/Wetstraat – one of Europe'selocal hubsof commerce and governance. The intense flames quickly spread due to an alleged electrical fault that had been going unnoticed for weeks according to building maintenance records seen by eyewitnesses, leaving only charred remains in its wake as firefighters battled the inferno through thick smoke (The European Parliament’s press office confirms evacuations but awaits more details).

Several EU officials were present at the time of the blaze. "We're deeply concerned about our staff members who might be trapped inside," says Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission. Emergency services are combing through debris for survivors and conducting search operations across multiple floors as rescue efforts continue into daylight hours (European Council spokesperson adds that there is no evidence to suggest foul play).

Amidst mounting fears, EU leaders gather today for an urgent meeting aimed at assessing the situation's impact on daily parliamentary work. "It’s critical we ensure minimal disruption in our legislative processes," states Maltese Prime Minister Alternate President Robert Abela who is chairing this emergency session alongside Germany’s Ursula von der Leyen, current EU Commission president (The European Parliament confirms that meetings and committees will proceed virtually from tomorrow onwards).

As rescuers work tirelessly to find survivors of the catastrophe with fear still lingering among staff members who had reportedly slept in offices, some believe electrical safety standards were not up-to-date enough given that this is a building constructed as recently as 2014 (Electrical experts arrive on scene to investigate while EU authorities consult with insurance representatives).

In the aftermath of Europe's most severe fire in decades, questions about infrastructure safety standards and potential negligence rise up among public discourse. "We need thorough investigations into what exactly caused this disaster," says a parliamentarian from Luxembourg emphasizing that stronger preventative measures should be implemented immediately going forward (Several insurance companies assess damage estimates while emergency crews work to restore power).

With EU member states already preparing for their regular sessions beginning next week, leaders are left with no option but to move meetings online and re-evaluate safety protocols within the Parliament. "Our priority now is finding ways around this hiccup in our daily routine," says an official from Austria's delegation (Virtual parliamentary committees commence work starting Monday).
