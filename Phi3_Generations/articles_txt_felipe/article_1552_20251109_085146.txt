India's Bollywood Industry Faces Severe Financial Hit Due to COVID-19 Lockdown Extension in Maharashtra - CNN India News  

MUMBAI (CNN) -- The Indian film industry, known as the epicenter of global cinema and a significant contributor to both Bollywood's reputation and national economy is grappling with an unprecedented crisis. According to recent reports in Mumbai, Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Balwekar has extended lockdown measures until May 30 due to rising COVID-19 cases across the state -- a decision that could potentially derail plans for numerous high-profile Bollywood productions set to release this year.

Industry insiders estimate around Rs 5 billion (US$67 million) in losses since mid-March alone, with film sets suspended and shooting schedules disrupted as studios struggle to maintain social distancing protocols amidst the new restrictions. As of May 13th, Maharashtra reported nearly 400K COVID-19 cases -- accounting for more than a quarter of India's total confirmed infections - prompting this latest lockdown extension that has already begun to raise concerns among industry professionals and local authorities alike.

"It is an unfortunate setback, but we must prioritize public health," said Balwekar at his recent press conference announcing the new restrictions. "We understand how important these productions are for our economy as well." Maharashtra contributes nearly 25% of India's box office revenue annually with Mumbai serving as its cultural hub; thus, this situation is having a ripple effect across sectors throughout the nation.

Industry expert Rakesh Sinha stated that "the extended lockdown poses significant challenges for upcoming and ongoing film projects in terms of both timelines and budgets." Production schedules have been delayed or canceled, with many industry professionals voicing their disappointment as well as fears about the financial impact. Actor Rajkumar Rao who was working on a project set to release this summer said he has "no choice but to re-negotiate my contract now."

The film production halt in Maharashtra is not just limited to Bollywood productions, with Hollywood and international projects that planned their shooting phases there also being affected. As per reports from Pune Studios - a hub for both Indian and International films -- it has delayed the start of at least 10 different ventures due to this extension including one blockbuster film which had already begun production before lockdown measures were first announced on March 25th by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

However, not all productions have been put off for good reasons with some using the extended break as an opportunity for regrouping and revisiting script details ahead of shooting resuming later this summer or early autumn; only time will tell how much more damage is sustained by these essential industries amidst India's fight against COVID-19.

"While we all understand that the health concerns are paramount, I hope our government takes necessary measures to minimize financial losses," stated producer Avinash Kumar Singh of New Delhi who was forced to halt a production last month in Mumbai alone due to these restrictions and has now been compelled once again.
