In a thrilling turn of events this past weekend in Nashville, Tennessee, local amateur hockey team, The Frozen Welders, clinched an improbable victory against the reigning national champions from Quebec City at last night's regional final game on Saturday. As they approached their second period face-off with a roaring crowd of 500 supportees and passionate locals behind them in downtown Nashville, tensions were high for this David vs Goliath matchup that had hockey fans across the country glued to screens nationwide from noon until well into Sunday.

The Welders started strong on their home ice at Perkins Field Arena with a score of 1-0 after just ten minutes due to an astonishing goal by rookie player, Ethan Roberts who seized his chance when the opposition went scoreless for most of this first period's opening four minutes. Despite trailing heavily in power plays and penalties against The Welders from Quebec City earlier during their road trip into Nashville last weekend with a score 5-1 on January 24th, Coach Mike Turner has always believed his team could pull off an upset at home under the right circumstances.

"We have faced better teams than this one in big games before and came back to win it," said former Welders' player turned mentor for The Frozen Welders coaches Alex Grant, during a pre-game interview on Saturday morning with CNN Local Sports Analyst Joe Mitchell from the Nashville studio. "This team has heart; they will give you everything."

Early into the second period when fans began to lose hope after their opponents had taken an early 3-1 lead by halftime, The Welders found new life in goalie Derek Foster who made a series of incredible saves. Then came Ethan Roberts scoring his first ever hat trick for his team which helped him regain lost confidence and set the tone with several crucial ones throughout the rest of this period when he scored three goals himself against no response from Quebec City's offense.

"I thought it was our chance to prove ourselves today," said Ethan Roberts, grinning as a crowd gathered around us after his third goal in over thirty minutes that broke club record and stunned observers on Sunday night during the post-game interview with Coach Mike Turner by the rinkside microphone. "We practiced really hard together this week, believe me when I say we're not going away empty handed today."

At one point in second period scoreless tie at 3-all, a stunned crowd of Montreal supporters began to chant 'Game over for Nashville!' while their cheers had faded from the rinkside stands. But The Frozen Welders rookie's energy never wavered as they fought back with ten straight shots in this final twenty minutes, including five goals by Roberts himself after having just one goal a couple of periods before which he attributed his success to hard work and learning from previous setbacks that had cost him games.

"This is the culmination years of dedicated practice for me since I was ten," said Ethan as Nashville's 6-2 victory score card read at last whistle, "We fought back with everything we got because this means a lot to us."
