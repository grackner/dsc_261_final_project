In a dramatic turn of events last Thursday evening in New Delhi, an alleged act of terrorism shook parts of South Asia when unidentified gunmen opened fire at the historic Red Fort, just hours before President Ram Nath Kovind's annual Independence Day address. The assault reportedly took place around 7 PM local time with no fatalities or injuries confirmed as yet by police authorities who are maintaining a strict watch over potential threats in and out of India. As the Indian government grapples to understand the motivation behind this horrific act, speculations range from internal dissent within radical groups to possible retaliatory measures against perceived foreign influences on domestic policies.

Officials have expressed grave concerns as they scramble for answers amidst rising tensions and fear among citizens nationwide following yesterday's incident at the sacred site revered by many Indians across different religious backgrounds alike. Police Commissioner Rakesh Astik, in a somber statement issued later that evening said, "Our priority is ensinment of public safety - we want to ensure there are no loose ends as investigations proceed."

India's security agencies have been on high alert since Friday when the attack was reported. Multiple sources told CNN-News18 they were informed by police that surveillance cameras at several key locations around New Delhi had captured movements consistent with gunfire last night during what otherwise would be a quiet period in India’s capital city bustling streets filled predominantly with tourists and locals celebrating 72nd Republic Day.

"This incident has left many people shocked, scared," said Meena Kapoor, who was visiting the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel when shots were fired near her location during evening rush hour traffic flow between markets in Old Delhi and New Town areas - both major Independence Day tourist destinations for locals alike.

In a press conference on Friday morning at 9 AM local time, Minister of Home Affairs Amit Shah urged calm saying "We are dealing with the situation cautiously as it develops". He added that security agencies were closely monitoring any unusual activities around critical infrastructure across India while they worked tirelessly in identifying suspects and ensuring public safety during these trying times.

The Red Fort, an iconic symbol of resistance against colonial rule is just one site being investigated along with numerous other locations such as malls frequented by locals & tourists - primarily commercial centres that could potentially be targeted in similar attacks or acts designed to spread fear among citizens nationwide; authorities have yet not ruled out the possibility for more incidents. In a bid toward restoring confidence, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed his countrymen via video link from Panipat on Friday evening while reiterating that India's unity would prevail through these trying times and reminded people to stay alert but not scared by acts of terrorism committed against us.

The government has promised swift justice for the brave men & women who have protected their nation in previous years when faced with such attacks, ensuring citizens safety even at cost – sacrificing personal comforts or lives if necessary while vowing to continue safeguarding Indian democracy from threats lurking both within its borders and beyond. Official statements conveyed that stringent security measures were implemented immediately after the incident unfolded last weekend; however, there has been little concrete information on any arrests so far - with all fingers pointed towards potential domestic terror
