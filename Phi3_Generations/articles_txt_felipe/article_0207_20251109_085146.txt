A rare sight at Yankee Stadium was baseball fans who got to witness a Major League game without any of their team on the field due to COVID-19 protocols being implemented across professional sports leagues in New York City this weekend. The National League had an empty diamond as only one player and four staff members were present, with spectators limited by Governor Andrew Cuomo's mandate that no more than 30% capacity be reached indo endorsement

CNN Sport - Major League Baseball to Play Empty Games Amid Pandemic Restrictions

NEW YORK CITY — As professional sports navigate the challenges brought on by COVID-19 once again, spectators are bracing for a new reality at Major League Baseball parks across New York City this weekend. In an unprecedented move driven by stringent pandemic restrictions and public safety concerns, fans will witness what might appear to be ghost games where only essential personnel attend while empty stands fill with silent anticipation.

The Metropolitan Opera House in the heart of Manhattan has felt a sense of emptiness that extends beyond its usually lively concert halls since March 2021 when they too faced similar restrictions, but never before had Yankee Stadium and Madison Square Garden been rendered nearly void during peak season time. On Sunday nights typically reserved for packed stands in New York's largest stadium came a scene straight out of history books as the National League played its empty game against the Boston Red Sox with just three players, four staff members, security personnel and essential visitors allowed inside under Governor Andrew Cuomo’s recent 30% attendance cap.

MLB officials confirmed that fans were permitted into Yankee Stadium last Sunday to witness an official Major League Baseball baseball match between local rivals the New York Mets & Boston Red Sox due diligence, yet only essential personnel such as security staff members and a select few vendors attended along with 50 special guests from hospitals dealing directly or indirectly on COVID-19 treatment. Despite efforts by Major League Baseball to resume full capacity games in the near future, there seems little hope for fans outside of New York City this season given tight restrictions imposed nationwide as well local NYC limits due a recent surge that has seen nearly 50% positivity rate here along with hospital ICU occupancy hitting record highs.

"The last thing we want is to spread the virus, but it's important for our team and staff members who have been through so much already during this pandemic," a National League spokesperson said while emphasizing how vital mental health support has become throughout all these uncertainties ongoing. "We understand that baseball means everything here in New York City."

The experience was as unique for fans and players alike; emotions ran high amongst empty stands where murmurs of disappointment could be heard amidst quieted conversations between staff members clad head-to-head with PPE masks while essential workers bustled through stadium corridors in an effort to keep operations moving smoothly. "It's not easy being a Yankee fan right now," said one disheartened spectator, as she wiped away tears from her eyes at the sight of rows upon empty seats surrounding their family-owned concession stand located strategically near center field where food service staff tirelessly worked through plates stacking despite feeling overwhelmed by emotions within them.
