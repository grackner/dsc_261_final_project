As of April 10th, a powerful storm system has struck Queensland in southeastern Australia with unprecedented rainfall and strong winds causing widespread damage across the region. More than 35 inches of rain have been recorded over just three days, leading to numerous flooded communities along the Fitzroy River near Rockhampton.

In a press conference yesterday afternoon, Queensland's Premier Palaszczuk confirmed that hundreds are still in evacuation centers as waters continue rising and rivers cresting levels last seen decades ago. Emergency Services Minister Lawrie Pryer stated at the same time that more than 40 homes had been completely destroyed by floodwaters, while over a thousand people sought shelter within public buildings around Rockhampton alone after their properties were submerged as high as two meters above ground level.

Rocky Bay resident Peter Murphy shared his ordeal on social media last night saying: "We've never seen anything like this before - it feels apocalyptic." While the extent of damage is still being assessed, local authorities believe that damages could exceed AUD $250 million (USD).

"There are no words to describe what we witnessed yesterday," said Rockhampton Mayor Graham in an interview. "It was like a biblical deluge - nature has been unleashed upon us with overwhelming force." The mayor went on to appeal for international aid and support, emphasizing the need for resources beyond local capacity given that several rivers are expected to keep rising until Tuesday night at least according to Bureau of Meteorology forecasts.

The storm is projected by weather experts from Australia's national meteorological agency National Weather Service (BOM) as a low-pressure system, moving eastwards towards New South Wales and Victoria in coming days with moderate rain but no serious flooding expected there so far based on the current forecast.

Official reactions have been swift; Prime Minister Scott Morrison has activated federal assistance for disaster relief operations including deploying a specialist search, rescue team from Sydney which arrived at Rockhampton Airport yesterday evening after being prepped in Darwin ahead of this emergency situation developing into one that needed external intervention.

Meanwhile down south on the east coast where flooding has already begun to affect some communities living near rivers and creeks with small water bodies, officials from various local councils are closely monitoring forecasts while keeping preparedness measures in place including issuing evacuation orders for residents at risk of landslides.

"We have learned so much over the last couple months on flooding events around Australia," commented Geoscience Research Institute Director Dr Susan Wroughton during a visit yesterday morning to inspect some affected areas up close along Brisbond Creek in New South Wales state capital, Sydney's suburb of Blue Mountains. "It is essential that we continue researching these phenomena for better understanding and mitigation against future occurrences."

The full impact on agriculture could be devastating with an estimated $30 million damage to crops alone in Queensland based upon the latest assessment from national Crop Report of Australia. This includes substantial losses among livestock farms, according to reports by industry bodies such as Rural Outlook which also cited concerns about potential spreading diseases amidst crowded evacuation centers and makeshift housing solutions for displaced communities struggling with limited supplies after the floods have receded
