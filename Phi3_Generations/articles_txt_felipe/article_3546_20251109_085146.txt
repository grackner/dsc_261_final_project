A beloved baseball stadium in Texas experienced a significant scare last night when lightning struck just 10 feet from center field during an early-season game between two local rivals on Friday evening at the historic Arlington Stadium, Dallas/Fort Worth area. The event left players and fans with unnerving memories of past storms in Texas that had occasionally disrupted outdoor activities due to safety concerns about flying debris from sudden downpours or lightning strikes during summer thunderstenergies showcased by local experts how quickly weather can shift on a sunny day.

Arlington, home of the Fort Worth Nationals and rival team Dallas Dodgers, has seen its fair share of meteorological surprises in recent years with sudden gust fronts leading to unexpected power outages during evening games or downpours turning springtime matches into mud baths for misjudged players. Last night's game promised a similar challenge but took an unanticipated turn when the skies opened up and lightning struck mere feet from where two teams were preparing to play on Friday at Arlington Stadium, located just 10 miles north of downtown Dallas near I-20/I-35E interchange.

The strike occurred while players were in midfield during a pregame warmup session that typically lasts about half an hour before the first pitch is thrown by local broadcaster Jim McDonnell at 7:15 PM CDT, reports ABC News meteorologists who confirm no one was struck directly but advises caution. According to National Weather Service radar and eyewitness accounts like that of Dodger left-fielder Tom Jackson, "the strike caused quite a bit of commotion among the players," as they scrambled for safety under their team tents moments after lightning struck close enough that sound reached spectators.

Dr. Sarah Bennett, professor emeritus at University of Texas and baseball historian tells CNN Sports Nation: “It’s not common to see a strike so near during an evening game in this part of the state with cooler temperatures like it was last night.” The Fort Worth Nationals had just started their second-inning batting practice when lightning struck, halting proceedings and leading officials at Arlington Stadium to quickly reassess safety measures. 

“We were all taken aback by the sudden turn of events,” said Dodger outfielder Maria Hernandez as she helped clear away fallen debris after everyone was dismissed from playing due to what local stadium authorities term “a preventative measure for lightning strike.” This decision comes amid growing concerns about how quickly thunderstorms can develop and their potential impact on crowded outdoor sports venues.

"We've seen an uptick in storm activity as a result of climate change, but we hadn’t expected it to affect baseball games this much," said local meteorologist with KDFW-TV Chuck Reece before the game began at 6:30 PM CDT, per reports from CNN Weather.

This incident raises important questions about how stadium policies and safety procedures will evolve as weather patterns become increasingly erratic in some areas of Texas — a state with a storied baseball history that draws crowds for local games throughout the summer months when lightning is most frequent, reports Dallas-Fort Worth Local Newspapers.
