Davis scored a career-high as he led Suns past Warriors with an impressive performance in Game 1 of their Western Conference semifinal series at Oracle Arena on Thursday night (February 20, 2024). The crowd roared when Davis nailed his final shot right before the buzzer.

Philadelphia's Joel Embiid sunk in three-pointer but was not enough to stop Suns as they overwhinued Warriors with a score of 125-103, securing their place in the Western Conference final against Los Angeles Clippers. This win comes after an exceptional season where Phoenix has maintained a .760 home winning percentage – one of its strongest aspects this year along with youthful rookie energy and veteran experience under head coach Monty Williams's guidance.

Embiid, though not at his best today in Philadelphia due to minutes constraints, is determined to fight back for the remaining six games against Clippers who have been an inconsistent team all season but managed a victory over Warriors on Thursday night as they continue their journey towards Los Angeles - scoring 103 points.

"I am proud of our boys tonight," Williams said after Davis's stunning performance, where he scored almost half the points for Suns in an intense back-and-forth first quarter alone (75–68). "They showed resilience and teamwork even under immense pressure."

Davis had already made headlines earlier today when his biometric data from offseason training camp suggested he was at peak performance level, which could be crucial for this high-stakes matchup. His final shot before the buzzer echoed through Oracle Arena after a series of relentless drives and impressive rebounds by fellow rookie Phoenix's Christian Draperi (21 rebounding).

"That was an incredible performance," said head coach Chris Micheli, who called time-out right before the buzzer. "Davis showed his ability to elevate not just himself but everyone around him."

Despite Phoenix's strong showing in Game 1 of their Western Conference semifinal series against Golden State Warriors, Embiid managed a career high and was praised for turning defense into offense after years as the focal point. The crowd cheered louder at Oracle Arena when Joel struck again on his first shot since game start (3 pointers – 12–7).

"The young guns are shaping up well," said expert analyst Tom Fultz, who praised Suns' rookies Draperi and Davis for their performance. "Especially in the face of adversity from veterans like Embiid."

Fan reactions at Oracle Arena varied widely after both teams fought hard but ultimately had to give up with time running out (Clippers 103 - Warriors 96). The crowd's frustration was palpable, and many fans wondered what this meant for their team's chances against the Clippers next week.

"It doesn’t matter how good you play," Suns guard Tyler Johnson said afterward in a press conference while his team celebrated victory. "The competition is tough; we have to keep improving as they do, too."

Looking ahead, both teams prepare for Game 2 of the semifinal series on Saturday (March
