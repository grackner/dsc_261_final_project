A fierce winter storm has brought a blanket of snow to New York City yesterday evening with temperatures plummeting and gusty winds making it feel even colder throughout the night and into early morning hours, leading major transportation services like subways, buses, and trains to suspend operations for safety. The National Weather Service had issued a winter storm warning as of 7 p.m., which extended through midnight at some point during this time frame when accumulations reached over two feet in certain neighborhoods such as the Bronx's Mount Eden Park, where residents were shoveling out their homes and cars early Tuesday morning.

"I thought it was never going to end," said long-time resident Maria Gonzalety about her experience dealing with snowstorm aftermath when interviewed by reporters outside on Wednesday while waiting for the bus which resumed service around 9 a.m., though not without delays due its overwhelming demand during rush hour and concerns among local commuters who were caught unprepared despite being aware of an imminent storm approaching, according to city transportation officials in conversation with Newsday earlier today before the full extent became apparent on Sunday night when snow started falling heavily. 

Gonzalety's experience is not unique - New York City has been under siege by a powerful northerly low pressure system since last evening that produced an atmospheric river of blizzard conditions overnight into early Monday, leading Mayor Bill de Blasio to declare a snow emergency just before dawn on Sunday and mandate the closure of some city streets. As per NWS reports citing satellite imagery showing rapidly intensifying cold air aloft colliding with warm moisture-laden Atlantic waters close offshore creating this severe winter event which could bring up to three feet across most parts within 36 hours before tapering off early Wednesday morning after the front passes southward. Residents are advised not travel unless it's absolutely necessary, per a directive from Governor Kathy Hochul that came as no surprise since forecaster had been warning of this exact scenario for weeks and urging New Yorkers to prepare well in advance by keeping an emergency kit at home with provisions such as food, water purifiers, blankets among other essentials. 

"It's going to be a long tough week," said Hochul during her briefing yesterday while discussing how she personally braved the storm last winter that closed down city agencies including transportation systems due to similar circumstances and reminded New Yorkers about heeding advisories from authorities when severe weather warnings are issued - something which many citizens seemingly failed on this occasion, leading public safety officials across NYC firefighters responding non-stop during the storm's peak as they battled fallen trees blocking roadsides while conducting rescue operations amidst traffic chaos. "We will recover quickly but we need everyone to stay home and safe," she stressed emphatically before ending her remarks, which garnered mixed reactions among citizens who were concerned about job losses due to extended closures yet also recognized the safety concerns posed by such extreme weather conditions that could potentially result in more fatalities if not taken seriously.

Emergency services are continuing their response efforts amidst freezing temperatures and snowfall as city officials work on clearing roadways while traffic has been cleared of non-essential vehicles, with buses resuming limited service today following advice from de Blasio who issued a
