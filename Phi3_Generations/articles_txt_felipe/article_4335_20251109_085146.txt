Seoul has been shaken by a sudden outbreak of unrest following years without protests in South Korea's capital city and surrounding areas since late September. Protesters demanding social reform have gathered sporadically over the last week, with numbers estimated to be around 150 people today at Gwanghwamono Square, marking a significant shift from months of political silence that followed sweeping anti-corruption measures in December aimed at rooting out corrupt officials.

The tension has risen amidst the backdrop of growing discontent towards government policies and societal issues such as economic inequality, rising housing costs, poor public transportation infrastructure, and lack of affordable healthcare options for many citizens. The protesters have expressed frustration at being marginalized from political discourse despite frequent social media campaigns that called on the authorities to address their grievances in light of recent progressive movements worldwide such as Black Lives Matter or #MeToo movement, and they're demanding policy changes through peaceful demonstrations.

"It is time for us to take a stand," says Park Jisoo (not real), "We have been suffering quietly without being heard by the authorities." A 24-year-investment banker with two small kids and an unpaid mortgage, this mother of three represents many more citizens who share similar stories.

The demonstrations come after President Moon Jae-in's administration pledged to launch nationwide consultation sessions on issues ranging from income distribution policies to labor rights in early December as part of the government's commitment to addressing social concerns beyond just anti-corruption efforts that led him into office. Protesters are calling for immediate policy changes, including minimum wage increases and more affordable housing options, but they allege their voices have been silenced amid a lack of transparency from politicians who argue the country has made significant strides since President Moon took power last May in combating corruption among high-ranking officials.

The protests initially broke out on February 10 at Gwanghwamono Square, with numbers peaking around 50 people that day before dwindling to just a handful over the following weeks due to cold winter temperatures and strict police presence aimed at curbing anti-government sentiment. However, social media has seen an increase in organized demonstrations since last Monday when several thousand protesters marched through downtown Seoul en route to Gwanghwamono Square before being dispersed by security forces using tear gas and water cannons on Wednesday afternoon after clashing with police outside City Hall.

Kim Eun-soo (not real), a 35-year-old university student in Seoul, was one of the peaceful protesters who joined Monday's march: "We all want positive change for our country and we hope to make our voices heard by engaging with politicians directly through nonviolent means. We just need some attention paid."

The National Assembly Speaker Kim Young-choon (not real) has said that parliament is open, willing to listen but believes the current situation requires dialogue between both sides first: "We must come together and work towards finding common ground as we move forward with our country's progress. The protestors need a voice in this conversation."

As South Korea continues its journey of economic growth while simultaneously grappling with societal concerns, experts say that these
