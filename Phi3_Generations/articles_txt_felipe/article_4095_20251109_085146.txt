A soccer scandal rocked Manchester City when allegations surfaced last week suggesting that their star striker might have been taking performance-enhancing drugs during the season opener against Chelsea on March 17, reports CNN's sports correspondent Ian Millhaddon. The claim came as fans and rival team supporters were celebrating Manchester City’s early lead in a match that ended with an emphatic win at home by three goals to nil.

The allegations suggest Pep Guardiola's men have been trying everything, from unconventional training methods to potential illegal substances, all aimed towards maintaining the team as league favorites ahead of their fixture against Liverpool on March 24th at home in a packed Etihad Stadium. The accusation that Aymeric Laporte might have been using banned performance-enhancing drugs has caused an uproar within City's management and among the supporters, who are now demanding full transparency from their team as they prepare for a crucial game in midweek.

“I am aware of these rumors but we must approach them with caution until all facts have come to light,” says Manchester City FC Chief Executive Ferran Soriano during an official statement today, March 18th at the club’s main office on Cheshire Cheapside in central London. He added that "any suggestion of unethical conduct would be deeply regretted and swiftly addressed if proven."

The allegations first emerged after one fan spotted Laporte looking sluggish during a pre-match warm-up at the Etihad Stadium on March 17th, just hours before kickoff against Chelsea. Manchester City FC manager Guardiola dismissed questions about lapse in form by saying that all players under his guidance are subject to rigorous drug testing and compliance with anti-doping rules.

“We understand the concerns of our fans who have high standards for this club’s integrity,” states Laporte, whose performances saw him nabged six goals during Manchester City's last five matches in all competitions - a record unmatched since 2016 by any player on either side of the divide.

The case has prompted calls from fans and activists for stricter regulations within football clubs, as they fear similar incidents could undermine sportsmanship among athletes. FIFA President Gianluigi Buffon agrees with this sentiment adding that "it's imperative to maintain the spirit of fair play across all levels." He added: “Any violation is unacceptable and will be dealt strictly by governing bodies worldwide.”

The Football Association (FA) has launched an investigation, asking for Laporte’s urine sample taken during yesterday's match. FA Chief Executive Mark Bullingham confirms that samples of all players from both Manchester City FC teammates as well as their opponents will be examined within the next 72 hours and results are expected by March 25th - a day before Liverpool arrives in England for another midweek Premier League fixture.

The FA has issued a statement today, highlighting that they stand committed to upholding clean sportsmanship values; “Drug abuse not only harms the players themselves but also compromises their teams' integrity and performance." They added: "We are taking this case seriously as we understand how important it is for fans’ trust.”
