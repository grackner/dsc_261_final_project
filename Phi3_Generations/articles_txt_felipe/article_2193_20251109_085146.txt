A rare astronomical event set to take place next week is expected to captivate skywatchers in New York City on Tuesday evening when a total lunar eclipse will be visible from the Big Apple and surrounding regions (CNN). The celestial spectacle, which occurs once every few years, promises to draw crowds of astronomy enthusiasts eagerly anticipating its occurrence.

A local amateur astronomer explains what observers can expect: "During a total lunar eclipse, the Earth passes between the Sun and Moon—casting a long shadow on our natural satellite's surface," said Dr. Rachel Smith from the NYC Observatory Club. As sunlight reaches us filtered through the moon’s atmosphere – which is refracted to reveal striking shades of red during this rare event (Smith).

The New York City Department of Parks and Recreation has organized public viewing events across various parks including Central Park, Riverside Park in Manhattan, Queens' Flushing Meadows Corona Park near the United Nations Headquarters, Brooklyn’s Prospect Park Zoo at Prospect Park Southwest (New York City Department of Parks and Recreation).

In preparation for such a unique event on Tuesday night, city officials have emphasized public safety while ensuring proper viewing conditions. “Our main priority is to make sure everyone can enjoy the eclipse safely,” said Manhattan Borough President Gale A. Brewer (Brewer) during an emergency meeting discussing crowd control and park capacity measures last Thursday at Fiorello LaGuardia High School in Queens, where local experts will be setting up telescopes for public observation sessions throughout the evening from 6 pm until after midnight.

As nightfall approaches on Tuesday, thousands of skywatchers are expected to fill these parks armed with cameras and binoculars as they eagerly wait to capture this unparalleled astronomical event taking place right above them (DailyMail). 

In terms of timing for the eclipse's peak totality in New York City, it will occur at approximately 9:47 pm Eastern Daylight Time. During that time frame, observers should be able to see a faint reddish hue on the Moon as Earth’s shadow starts covering halfway through its disc while simultaneously experiencing partial eclipses earlier in the night (New York City Department of Parks and Recreation).

According to astronomy professor at Brooklyn College, Johnathan Davis - “Lunar eclipses occur only when both the Sun and Earth are aligned on opposite sides with respect to a third body like Moon. This alignment happens once every few months.” He adds that "While lunar eclipses can be enjoyed in most parts of North America where it’s visible, New York City offers prime vantage points for skywatchers as our clear sky is often obscured by light pollution."

With a rare astronomical phenomenon like this total lunar eclipse on the horizon and millions more around us worldwide eagerly waiting to see its spectacle in their local time zone, there's no better way than immortalizing it through photography. Experts suggest using ISO settings between 400-800 for a clear shot while shooting at f/16 or wider helps avoid overexposure due to bright moonlight (Professor Davis).
