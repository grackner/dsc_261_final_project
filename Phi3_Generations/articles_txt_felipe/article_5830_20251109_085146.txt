In a bold move that signifies how media giants are reshaping themselves in response to changing times and consumer preferences, NewsCorp has just announced its plan to cut back on print journalism while expanding their digital news offerings across the globe. The company stated this decision during an investor conference call yesterday afternoon from New York City headquarters; CEO John Smith made a firm commitment that by 2030, all NewsCorp publications will be exclusively online platforms or multimedia ventures in order to stay ahead of declining print readership and growing demands for real-time news access.

Smith emphasized the importance of keeping pace with societal shifts towards digital media consumption: “Our company is at a crossroads, one where we must either adapt our business model or risk being left behind,” he said to nodding agreement from his investors. According to industry analysts quoted by CNN Business, newspaper sales in the US dropped 7% last year while news website traffic increased significantly – underscoring this trend across many demographics worldwide.

As part of NewsCorp’ extrusion into digital media and multimedia ventures, it is said that they're planning to launch an innovative virtual reality experience called "VR World", set in a fictional dystopian future where journalism plays out as the last hope for humanity against oppressive forces. The project has been described by its creator Sarah Jones (not related) working on behner side of Media Productions division, as “a thought experiment about what it means to consume news when traditional narratives are no longer trusted”.

Not all stakeholders feel the same way though; veteran journalist Michael Baker warned that while embracing new technology is crucial for survival in today's business landscape: "We cannot let our passion and commitment towards journalism slip. As we move forward into this brave new world, ensuring accuracy must remain a cornerstone of trust between the media company and its audience."

Meanwhile on Capitol Hill, U.S Senator Jane Doe also voiced her concerns stating that “we need to make sure these businesses are still fulfilling their essential role in democracy by holding power accountable.” A recent poll shows 87% of Americans believe media outlets like NewsCorp have an important place within society, even as they shift focus.

As for the immediate future? Smith assured that while print publications would shrink down to limited circulation regional newspapers with a strong emphasis on community reporting – their goal remains unchanged: “To provide truthful and insightful stories about how our world is changing.” He continued, "We must continue doing what we do best. Journalism at its heart". 

Now that the plan has been announced publicly by NewsCorp officials during yesterday's investor conference call in New York City, industry experts will surely be keeping a close eye on how this transition unfolds over time and whether it effectively serves both business interests of survival while continuing to uphold journalistic integrity.
