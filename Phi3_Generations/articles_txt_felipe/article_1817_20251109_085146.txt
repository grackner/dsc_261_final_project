A massive landslide struck a remote village in Iceland early this morning, causing significant property damage but fortunately sparing lives according to eyewitnesses and local authorities. The event occurred around dawn on April 14 near the hamlet of Skálholt, situated close to Lake Lagarvatn within the Reynisfjara region in South Iceland's Westfjords area (approximately a six-hour drive from Reykjavik).

An experienced hiker named Magnus Eriksson described waking up when he heard an enormous rumbling sound that rapidly evolved into something resembling thunder. Rushing outside, the 50-year-old witness found himself in disbelief as hundreds of tons of soil and rock tumbled down a slope directly above his campsite at about dawn on Thursday morning (April 14).

"I've been hiking all over Iceland, but nothing like this ever happened to me. The whole place was instantly transformed into an unrecognizable scene of destruction," Eriksson said gravely while speaking outside the emergency center in Skálholt where he sought help for a sprained ankle sustained during his hasty escape from danger moments earlier that morning (April 14).

Officials estimate up to three million cubic meters have been dislodged as a result of overnight rains and freezing temperatures, which caused the mountain soil known locally as 'lahars' to destabilize. According to geologist Sigurjón Þórarinsson from Reykjavik University who examined on-site evidence this morning (April 14), he believes that a series of landslides occurred across multiple hills surrounding the village since yesterday evening when heavy rainfall began falling, with one particularly destructive episode occurring near sunrise.

Eriksson's wife Helga told CNN affiliate Stundin they had initially thought it was merely an unusually loud noise at first but became alarmed as debris continued to fall from the slope above their camp site just after dawn on Thursday (April 14). The couple were forced into hiding inside a nearby mountain hut for several hours before local rescue personnel arrived and cleared them out of harms way, along with numerous other villagers who had gathered in Skálholt's church hall to seek shelter from the downpour.

Rescue workers have already removed tons worth debris using heavy machinery as they assess potential long-term damage that could disrupt local livest016; infrastructure and transportation networks remain partially compromised after this morning's landslides near Skálholt in Iceland. Experts suggest it may be several months before the full extent of environmental, structural impact is known since geologic activity continues to occur sporadically throughout the region as weather conditions stabilize enough for more thorough investigations (April 14).

Helga Eriksson expressed gratitude toward rescuers: "It's a relief when you hear voices again in this eerie silence of destruction after such a terrifying experience." Residents who managed to find refuge at the church hall have been temporarily relocated back home by Icelandic police and civil defense authorities, with some staying as late today (April 14).
