Half of Mississippi State's football team tested positive for COVID-19 on campus last weekend, leaving their SEC championship game uncertain as teams scramble to create substitute players and reschedule matches affected by the outbreak according to CNN Money sources in Atlanta. The impact is significant with just 24 hours remaining before Saturday's match against Auburn at Davis Wade Stadium begins on August 31st, a date already set back from its original start time of September 6th due to Hurricane Ida delays. This latest outbreak has forced the university administration to cancel all non-essential activities and events in an effort to contain further spread, reports The Atlanta Journal-Constitution citing MSU Director of Athletics Greg Gojankias as saying "it's a matter of ensidery for our students that we take decisive actions immediately." 

Dr. Mark Wilson, head coach at Mississippi State University and one week away from his team stepping on the field against rival Auburn University in their SEC championship game said “This isn’t good timing but my players have shown resilience before; this is a challenge for all of us.” The football-driven school had been widely seen as favorites to win both its conference title and national trophy after finishing the regular season 12-0.

Several sources report that approximately two dozen athletes are already quarantined at MSU's residence halls, with more anticipated over next few days as additional positive cases pop up among their teammates in various living areas across campus from dormitories to off-campus apartments where players reside. The football program has been forced into creating an alternative game plan due the loss of half its roster and is searching for replacements on other teams' campuses, but finding a large enough pool remains difficult as many programs are also dealing with similar outbreaks within their ranks according to ESPN. 

While some opponents may try using this opportunity to gain an advantage if games have already been postponed due to weather or COVID-19 concerns; Coach Wilson is confident that his team has the strength, determination and support of its fans home in Vicksburg - a city renowned for their passionate supporters – they will prevail. “We’ve faced hardships before as an organization but coming together like we have shown everyone who knows us just how united this family is," he continued. The Athletic Department and MSU student government officials are holding urgent meetings to discuss the options at hand, including a potential request for postponement of their match-up with Auburn - an appeal that remains unclear as they await word from league administrators who have yet to decide on any adjustments in scheduling.

The outbreak has brought widespread attention and concern across not only the MSU community but also among fans nationwide for whom this Saturday's showdown between two SEC powerhouses is expected a sellout crowd of 20,000 to watch on their television screens or live stream via local radio channels. Mississippi State players were in high spirits before kickoff with coaches and medical staff reminding them that the football field was not just about winning games but also protecting one's health as they took steps towards adherence guidelines for COVID-19 safety, according to CBS Local report.

MSU President John C. Inman issued a statement on Wednesday in which he emphasized “our commitment and dedic
