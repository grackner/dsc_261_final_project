A major traffic incident on Interstate-95 near Baltimore yesterday resulted in a multi-vehicle pileup involving over 20 cars and trucks during rush hour at approximately 3:45 PM, reports CNN. Authorities are investigating the cause of an accident which blocked several lanes for nearly two hours before traffic was slowly restored to normal as emergency crews worked tirelessly along Interstate-95 near I-70 and Route 1 in Baltimore County around noon yesterday local time (PM).

According to official statements from the Maryland State Highway Administration, a multi-vehicle pileup occurred when three vehicles collided at an exit ramp; within minutes there were over twenty cars stuck on freeway ramps near Interstate 70 and Route 1 in Baltimore County around noon yesterday local time. All parties involved reportedly sustained minor injuries, with two individuals being transported to the hospital for observation while others received first aid at the scene before leaving unscathed.

"The collision occurred due to wet road conditions that led drivers' tires losing traction," said John Smith, spokesman for MDSHA who arrived on-site shortly after reports of an accident came through his radio channels; "There were about 25 cars involved in this pileup." Emergency crews worked throughout the incident with fire and ambulance personnel taking primary roles while towing vehicles began arriving from nearby cities as soon they became available.

One witness, Jane Doe shared her experience of hearing screeching brakes followed by a loud crash during rush hour traffic yesterday near I-70/Route 1 in Baltimore County; "I was stuck at the exit for almost an hour until all vehicles were finally removed." Another commuter expressed frustration with having to wait out on Interstate 70 due to heavy congestion caused by this accident.

While investigations continue, authorities have closed some lanes and are working diligently towards restoring normal traffic flow as quickly as possible; local residents who live near the affected area report they will be facing even longer commute times in future days without any promises that these delays would ever come to an end.

MDSHA officials assured commuters yesterday afternoon, saying repairs were ongoing and expected completion within hours with no further disruptions anticipated; "We apologize for the inconvenience caused but assure residents we are working efficiently towards full restoration of Interstate-95 service by late evening today." Commuters have since been directed to use alternate routes until normal traffic conditions resume on I-70 near Route 1 in Baltimore County.

In light of this incident, Maryland State Highway Administration plans hold a press conference tomorrow at the agency's headquarters located downtown with Director Susan Johnson speaking firsthand about measures being taken and how authorities can work together to prevent future occurrences; "We are taking immediate steps towards reviewing our policies regarding road safety in rainy seasons." As we await further developments on this major traffic incident involving a multi-vehicle pileup near I-70/Route 1, let's hope the necessary measures will be put into place to ensure drivers stay safe and arrive at their destinations promptly.
