Hannah Smith stood at her window in Seattle and watched as heavy rain battered against it for hours on Thursday night last week. The unrelenting downpour had brought about one of the most disruptive flooding incidents to hit the city since record-keeping began, according to local authorities who are still working tirelessly in rescue and recovery efforts a week later. 

As per reports from the National Weather Service (NWS), at least four inches of rain fell on Seattle over an astonishingly short span last Thursday evening into Friday morning—a rate that far exceeded typical rainfall levels for the area during such events, with records dating back to 1950 showing a max of only two inches recorded in similar situations.

"The flooding was extensive and caught us off guard," said Mayor John Thompson at an emergency press conference on Friday morning. "We need better forecasting tools." The mayor announced that his office had convened with the Department of Environmental Protection to review meteorological data, as well as city infrastructure resilience plans against such weather anomalies in order to avoid future incidents like this one.

Experts from reputable universities and institutions are expected back on-site for further assessments over next few days while officials seek grants and aid through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as more resources get allocated towards disaster mitigation strategies in Seattle going forward, especially regarding water management systems.

"We need to be prepared before it rains hard," says Professor Linda Harris from the University of Washington's School of Earth and Environmental Sciences who has studied regional weather patterns extensively over her career. "Investing more now will help us manage similar situations better in future."
