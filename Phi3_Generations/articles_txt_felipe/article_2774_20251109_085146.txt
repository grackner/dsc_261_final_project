A local university's recent study on sleep patterns has uncovered a surprising link between dreaming and learning retention among teenagers in New York City during their summer break from May to August this year. Researchers at the NYU School of Medicine have found that those who reported lucid dreaming had significantly higher recall abilities for material they learned before going on vacation compared to non-lucid dreamers, according to a paper published last week in Nature Sleep Journal.

"For years now, scientists and psychologists around the world are intrigued by this connection between memory consolidation during sleeping hours," said Dr. Emily Rosenthal, lead researcher of the study who specializes in neuroscience at NYU's medical school department. "Our findings suggest that dream-enhancing activities may boost learning retention beyond regular nightly rest."

The team interviewed over 300 high-school students from all across New York City, asking them to keep a journal of their experiences while sleeping during the summer break and document how often they had lucid dreams. Lucid dreamers reported becoming aware that they were in a dream state and could exercise some control within it; non-lucid dreamers didn't possess such awareness or influence over events occurring within them, but still experienced regular REM sleep where memories are consolidated from daytime learning.

In the study sample of students who reported having lucid dreams more than once a week and engaged in "lucid-enhancing activities," such as reality checks or maintaining journal entries throughout their nightly routine, 85% showed better retention scores on tests administered before summer vacation. The results suggest that the act of remembering to perform these activities during sleep may help solidify memories from daily life by transferring them into a dream state where they could be re-experienced and integrated with preexisting knowledge, as described in Dr. Rosenthal's paper.

"The idea is that the brain wants you learn something new," said Josephine Martinez, one of NYU Sleep Study volunteers who reported engaging regularly in lucid dreaming activities since early June when she started documenting her experiences before summer break began - and has noticed increased retention abilities. "It's like sleep is a natural form of reinforcement for information you need to remember, so we want the brain involved as much."

Experts have long recognized REM (rapid eye movement) sleep — which typically happens about 90 minutes into most adult and child naps or nighttime slumbers — as an important stage where memories are consolidated. In this phase of a person's typical cycle, brain activity becomes more like that during waking hours while muscle movements are suspended for the remainder of the time spent in REM sleep until awakening from non-REM (slow wave) sleep two or three times before rising.

However, past studies have been inconclusive about whether dreams themselves hold any cognitive benefit beyond this consolidation process because people's memories are blurred and distorted during REM due to a phenomenon called "mental time travel" where events experienced in the real world intermix with imagined ones occurring within our personal fictional narratives.

This is when lucid dreamers reportedly come into awareness that they're sleepwalking through an altered reality, allowing them to
