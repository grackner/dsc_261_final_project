Amid growing concerns over media concentration and its impact on democracy, a recent survey by Pew Research Center has revealed that nearly half of Americans are troubled by how news stories might be influenced or manipulated before reaching the public eye. Conducted in April this year among more than 1,50thousand respondents across various states, including California and New York, experts weighed in on what these findings mean for American society as a whole.

According to Dr. Elizabeth Thompson, Professor of Media Studies at the University of Chicago: "We've been witnessing an unprecedented wave of consolidation within media ownership that directly threatens journalistic integrity." She elaborates further by stating: “With fewer independent news outlets in operation today than we had just a couple decades ago, it has become increasingly difficult for the public to access diverse viewpoints and balanced reporting.”

The survey found major worries among respondents about biased coverage due to ownership interests. For instance, 60% of those under the age group of 35 believe that media bias is a serious issue in their country while only half as many over 60 years old feel similarly concerned. This generation gap may indicate varying levels of trust and understanding when it comes to news consumption habits within different generations - an aspect thoroughly investigated by Dr. John Martins, Senior Lecturer at Harvard University's Nieman Foundation for Journalism: "Younger individuals are more likely exposed to alternative sources outside traditional media platforms like social networks or blog sites which tend to have a greater variety of opinions."

The influence of corporate ownership on journalistic objectivity was also evident in several high-profile cases, most recently the ABC News investigation into Russian interference during past U.S elections and subsequent criticism from some Republicans about unfair coverage favoring Democrat narratives over facts - an issue that continues to polarize public discourse today according to Dr. Thompson: "There are allegations made against several media houses for sensationalizing stories or omitting crucial information in order to sway opinion, which undermines the very foundation of objective journalism."

In light of these developments and growing concerns over an impartial press landscape within American society today; some industry experts have called upon regulatory bodies such as FCC (Federal Communication Commission) or Congress members themselves to intervene more actively - not only on potential monopolistic practices but also by ensuring transparency in sourcing and ownership.

These revelations from the Pew survey underline just how critical independent journalism is for a functioning democracy, reminding us that access to multiple perspectives might help citizens make more informed decisions during elections or public discourse; ultimately preserving their voices within society's decision-making process. As Dr. Thompson says: “It’s imperative we strive towards maintaining media diversity and press integrity - if left unchecked, these threats could lead to further skewing of information which would only serve as fuel for societal divisions.”

Next steps being discussed amongst various industry players include a pushback against consolidation trends through policy recommendations or campaigns advocating greater support towards independent media outlets; promising an ongoing effort at redefining the role that journalism plays in modern democracies. However, with corporate entities wielding significant influence over newsrooms and political narratives alike - as highlighted by experts like Dr. Martins: “It will require concerted efforts
