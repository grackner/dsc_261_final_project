Winter Storm Goliath Battered East Coast with Snow and Wind Gusts Up to 40 MPH
By Sarah Martinson - Updated on Tuesday at 9:37 AM EST, Friday (October 5)—A powerful winter storm dubbed "Goliath" has been sweeping across the Eastern Seaboenergies from New York down through Florida overnight. Meteorologists say Goliath could bring up to four feet of snow in some areas and dangerous wind gusts reaching as high as 40 mph by early Monday morning before it starts dissipating later on Tuesday afternoon across the East Coast states.

The National Weather Service warns that coastal flooding, power outages, fallen trees, and travel disruptions are likely during Goliath's passage through cities like New York; Philadelphia; Washington D.C.; Baltimore; Richmond, Virginia; Atlanta, Georgia, and Orlando in Florida on Monday morning into the afternoon. The storm is forecasted to begin moving away from the Eastern Seaboerect by Tuesday evening with lighter snowfall expected for parts of central America as a warm front approaches later today.

"We are expecting life-threatening impacts due to strong wind gusts, ice and heavy accumulation of wet or dry snow," said National Weather Service Meteorologist Dr. John Davis during an interview yesterday afternoon in his office at the agency's headquarters located near Washington Dc. "People must avoid travel entirely today as we speak."

The storm was first reported early Saturday, but intensified rapidly after reaching landfall overnight between New Jersey and Virginia on Sunday before heading north towards Philadelphia where it unleashed wind gusts estimated at 35 mph along with snow flurries. Temperatures remain just above freezing for much of the region affected by Goliath today, which could exacerbate blizzard conditions as more cold air descends into New England from Canada.

A power company spokesman reported nearly two million outages across multiple states with over 100,000 customers in Virginia without electricity and additional utility workers dispatched to help restore service for the record snowfall expected along I-95 corridor between Washington Dc up through Maine. Residents have been advised by officials from New York's Governor Andrew Cuomo Office of Emergency Management (OEM) that no travel is allowed except in emergenies or life safety issues as Goliath continues its path northward today and into tomorrow with potential flood warnings issued for parts along the coastline.

"We cannot stress enough how dangerous this storm can be," said Andrew Cuomo, "Residents should stay indoors until it passes to avoid any possible hazards." 

Motorists stranded on roads were advised by New York State Police Trooper James Smith during a live briefing yesterday evening in Albany that they remain trapped. "The storm has not subsided yet, and snowfall will continue throughout the night," said trooper Smith from his office at headquarters located near Times Square in Manhattan which is still under blizzard warnings as winds gust down to 20 mph with more on their way today through Wednesday morning before finally dissipating overnight into Thursday.

Several power companies have begun dispatching emergency crews, including one of the largest energy providers in New York state who reported about half a million out
