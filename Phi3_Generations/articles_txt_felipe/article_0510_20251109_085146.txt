A new mindfulness initiative launched in Chicago this week aims to tackle mental health challenges among teenagers facing unprecedented levels of stress and anxiety due to social media pressures and academic expectations. The program, "MindChic," has been designed by local psychologists Dr. Lila Moore and Dr. Omar Jenkins in collaboration with Chicago's public schools system as a way to teach students mindfulness techniques that can be used daily for better mental well-beterm.

"As we witness the rise of anxiety among teens, it has become crucial to provide them tools they need not just academically but also emotionally," said Dr. Moore at an event held on Tuesday introducing "MindChic."

The free pilot program will initially be offered in select high schools across the Windy City with plans for expansion pending its initial success, according to a press release from Chicago Public Schools (CPS). During two-week sessions that start this week and run through next month at three locations on the South Side of the city, students as young as thirteen will learn simple breathing exercises, guided meditations, yoga postures specifically designed for teens' needs, body scans to help them recognize stress signals within themselves.

"The techniques we are teaching in 'MindChic' sessions have been shown through research conducted by Harvard University and others as effective methods of reducing anxiety," said Dr. Jenkins at the event on Tuesday afternoon where over fifty students had already signed up for the pilot program, according to a local reporter present there. "We want them not just surviving but thriving."

In an age when 70% of teenagers reported that they were feeling anxious or depressed almost every day as per recent surveys by The Trevor Project - an organization dedicated to suicide prevention among LGBTQ+ youth, these initiatives are essential. While "MindChic" is not the first mindfulness program in Chicago for students — several private schools and community organizations offer related services— this free public-school based pilot represents a new frontier aimed at bringing equitable access to mental health tools into school environments where academic pressures run high, as noted by Dr. Jenkins on Tuesday afternoon reporter's interview after the program launch event in Englewood High School auditorium 

"We are excited that Chicago Public Schools has recognized this need and embraced it for their students," said a local community leader quoted at an engagement session last week organized by CPS who also wanted "MindChic." He hopes to see the program expanded citywide in time, with regular mindfulness breaks throughout school days becoming as standardized.

The pilot sessions have been well received so far and many students looking forward more events like this feel that they offer something valuable when it comes down brute facts about their mental health or finding ways out of a seemingly impossible situation back at home, according to feedback gathered by CPS from participating families since the program's launch on Tuesday.

"I wish I had known mindfulness techniques growing up and tried them myself," said one student who signed up for "MindChic." The 15-year-old added that while she doesn’t struggle with anxiety, her friends do; hoping to help everyone feel more balanced in life.

The CPS board is set to vote on whether or not the program will continue and expand citywide next
