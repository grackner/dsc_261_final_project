New Study Reveals Extinct Animal Genome: Scientists Successfully Sequence Dodo DNA  
Published on Tuesday by DailyMail Science Desk

In a groundbreinfluenced milestone in science, researchers have unveiled the first draft of an extinct animal's genome — that of the dodo bird. The team from Durham University worked to sequence and study the DNA extracted from museum specimens preserved during early expeditions on Mauritius between 1638 and 1726, with their findings published in the journal Current Biology yesterday (March 9).

The researchers said they were stunned by how much was left of a creature that had vanished over four centuries ago. "It's been estimated only about one-quarter of all species have even close relatives for which we could get DNA, yet our findings suggest the dodo may not be as different from living birds." said Dr Emma Sankey, lead researcher on the project and lecturer in evolutionary genomics at Durham University.

The international team says that they now intend to use what's known of the bird's genome — which was estimated after DNA tests showed it had not been preserved well due to exposure during centuries of being stuffed for display, DailyMail reports. Dr Sankey said: "Because we know so much about how species have evolved since then and where they live now, this is the perfect time to find out more."

The team hopes that their new genome study will provide insights into dodo evolution and why it went extinct on Mauritius in 1680 — likely from overhunting by sailors arriving with European ships. One of those who helped identify the bird's close modern relatives, Dr Chris Turvey at Queen Mary University of London told Mail Online: "This is a massive and wonderful discovery."

"I think it will be one of the most significant scientific events in history," said Sankey to DailyMail Science Desk. The team hopes that their findings may have wider implications on understanding extinction, evolution, as well as finding missing species' genetic blueprints — which scientists believe can inform conservation efforts and reintroduction projects across various endangered animals around the globe today.

In a separate effort to unravel more of the dodo bird mystery over at Edinburgh University in Scotland last year, researchers sequenced DNA from two leg bones discovered during excavations on Mauritius — but only managed to get small fragments for an incomplete genome study published earlier this month (February 28).

However, scientists hope the new findings could inspire other experts across different fields of research working with extinct animals or plants. Dr Sankey explained: "The dodo is often described as a 'living fossil,' yet it's very much an evolved species like us that lived and died long ago."

She added, in reference to the team’s new findings on evolution over time for this flightless bird from Mauritius, which was inhabited by native dodo birds: "This gives incredible insights into what extinction is really about — it's not just that something vanishes. It also tells a story of an organism evolving and changing with its environment."

For the public who may remember seeing stuffed dodos in their grandparents’ homes, Sankey urges them to check out some online exhibits as well as
