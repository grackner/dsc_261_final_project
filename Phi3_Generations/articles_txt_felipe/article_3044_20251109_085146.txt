Scientists from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory announced on Tuesday that they have detected a worrying increase in carbon dioxide levels over Greenland and Antarctica for the first time in modern human history, suggesting unprecedented rates of global warming. The researchers found CO2 concentrations were at their highest recorded since 1984 when direct measurements started on ice cores extracted from these regions.


The lead author Dr. Emily Jones said, "These findings are a stark indicator that our current efforts to curb carbon emissions simply aren't enough." The report has sparked international concern as it suggests the planet may be nearing an irreversible tipping point in climate change if aggressive action is not taken soon.


Senior Climate Scientist at NOAA, Dr. Mark Thompson commented on this development stating that "the rapidity with which greenhouse gases accumulate now exceeds what we predicted even a decade ago." The findings come amid increasingly frequent and severe weather events around the globe attributed to climate change.


Experts argue for an immediate increase in renewable energy investments, while activists call on governments worldwide to implement stricter environmental policies as soon as possible.
