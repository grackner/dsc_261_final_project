A severe heatwave sweeping across Texas could break state records this weekend as temperatures soar to unprecedented levels in many regions of the Sunshine State. The city of Houston witnessed a high temperature record-breaking peak at 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 Celsius) on Friday, and meteorologists expect these sweltering conditions could persist well into next weekend with Dallas likely to see temperatures consistently exceeding the usual August averages by more than ten degrees.

Heat advisories have been issued across various Texas counties including Brazos County in central-eastern Houston where residents, mostly elderly and children especially those without AC systems at home are being warned of potential heat illnesses with temperatures set to remain above 95 Fahrenheit (35 Celsius) throughout the weekend. The National Weather Service has forecasted an extended stretch of high pressure which is causing a stubborn hot-air dome trapping warmth over Texas, preventing cloud cover and cooler evening air from providing relief as they normally would in August months.

Dr. Sarah Lopez with the University of Houston’s Atmospheric Sciences department shared her expert opinion on this unprecedented situation stating that it's a result of natural atmospheric patterns compounded by global climate change which are making extreme weather events more frequent and intense than ever before in history:

"It is not just about the immediate discomfort these heatwaves bring but understanding their long-term impact on our environment. As we continue to push temperatures higher, it's imperative that this issue becomes a top priority for policy makers." 

The Environmental Protection Agency has confirmed an increase in energy consumption with Texas already battling power outages from earlier weather issues and now facing record-breaking demand due the extreme heat. Emergency services are being stretched to their limits as authorities grapple not just immediate emergencies but also concerns about long term impacts on vulnerable populations, especially elderly living alone who could be at risk of serious illnesses from prolonged exposure without adequate cooling systems in place:

"We are taking all necessary steps to ensure the safety and wellbeing of our residents during this challenging time," said Harris County Sheriff's Deputy Chief, Thomas Jackson. 

The state has activated emergency protocol with temporary shelters set up across major cities like Houston in order to provide relief for those who may not have access or resources necessary enough to combat these extreme temperatures while officials urge everyone stay indoors during peak heat hours as much as possible, keeping an eye on vulnerable family members and pets.

While residents continue to cope with the immediate challenges posed by this extraordinary weather event, scientists around the world have been rushing out studies pointing towards increasingly frequent extreme weather events which are expected only to worsen in coming years without significant mitigation efforts: 

Dr Emily Taylor from NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center has conducted extensive research into climate change and its impact on U.S' weather systems, revealing that the warming of our planet is leading towards more frequent heatwaves as well increased intensity in storm patterns all around us today: 
"Our findings are stark reminders to act now before it’s too late." The scientific community continues to emphasize urgent need for action by policy makers and the public alike. As temperatures continue
