A powerful winter storm is set to hit New York City late tonight into tomorrow morning with snowfall expected at rates of up to two feet per hour in certain areas before tapering off by early afternoon on Friday (Januthy, January 15). The blizzard warning issued just after midnight will be the first such event for NYC since December last year and follows a series of inclement weather affecting parts of Eastern U.S.

Residents in several counties across New York state are being advised to stay indoors as snowfall rates peaked at 2:00 PM EST today with accumulations reaching up to six inches per hour, according to the National Weather Service (NWS). As of early this evening, Governor Kathy Hochul issued an emergency executive order allowing for the preemptive closure of school districts and non-essential businesses across New York state in anticipation of what would be a record snow event. 

"This is one storm that does not play nice," said meteorologist John Williams from Albuquerque, NM. He explained to CNN how this blizzard was formed as "a strong low-pressure system collided with cold arctic air and moisture coming off the Atlantic Ocean." As a result of these elements combining in such an unusual manner over New York state's terrain, there are expectations that snowfall rates will reach unprecedented levels.

"There is no doubt about it: We need to take this storm seriously," said Macy's CEO Mark Gonsky, as he closed the city’s flagship department store earlier today at 2 PM EST after more than seven inches of snow fell during daylight hours alone yesterday (Januthy, January 15).

A homeless man named James Thompson shared his concerns about finding shelter. "I was hoping to ride out this storm on the streets until it passes," he said with a sigh as police blocked off alleys where many sleep rough in New York City during winter months. A city worker told him, “We’re not making exceptions for anyone right now,” adding that all individuals without shelter were being asked to go home or find temporary accommodation from friends and family nearby (DailyMail, January 15).

Several cities across the region are reportedly on their highest emergency alerts with officials urging residents in areas of high snow accumulation to stay put. "We will be providing food aid where needed as well," said Mayor Eric Adams during a press conference today afternoon (Januthy, January 15).

Snow-removal crews have been deployed throughout the city starting earlier this morning with New York City Parks Department plowing public streets while National Guard members assist in clearing major intersections. "We're mobilizing all our resources to keep people safe," said Commissioner Kathryn Garcia, speaking on behalf of Mayor Adams during a press conference yesterday evening (Januthy, January 14).

The NWS continues to urge residents and officials alike not to underestimate the strength or duration of this storm. Meteorologists predict that wind speeds could reach up to hurricane-force levels in certain areas with gusts potentially reaching more than fifty miles per hour at times (Januthy, January 15).

In response, emergency management teams have been prepped and officials like New York State Police Superintendent Kevin Fryer are on standby. "We're not taking any
