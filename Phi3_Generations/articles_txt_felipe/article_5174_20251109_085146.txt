A daring art heist in New York City has taken the world by storm: An exclusive painting once owned by a famous artist was stolen from The Metropolitan Museum of Art last Tuesday night into an undisclosed location with no trace left behind as yet. Security footage captured nothing but silence, indicating that thieves wore earpieces and communicated via hand signals during their swift operation.

The missing artwork is "Whispers on Canvas," a masterpiece created by the acclaimed artist Eleanor Dufresne in 2015 which had been housed at The Metropolitan Museum of Art for over five years before its disappearance from Room 47, an area dedicated to postmodern art.

Metro Police Chief Inspector Angela Moreno confirmed the report: "This is a serious incident that not only impacts our beloved museum and community but also brings attention back on cultural heritage." The Metropolitan Museum of Art's Director Gregory Hawthorn expressed his shock in an official statement saying, "I am devastated by this senseless act. 'Whispers on Canvas' was a significant piece that brought immense joy to our visitors."

According to witnesses interviewed at the scene near Central Park, around 10pm when the heist took place, no unfamiliar faces were reported and they heard nothing unusual as patrons continued their regular activities. The painting is valued between $3-5 million based on current market rates for Dufresne' extradited work pieces but it might fetch a higher price given its uniqueness and the notoriety of artist Eleanor herself, who has had multiple artworks stolen before this incident - although no traces have ever been found.

Local experts in security at various museums across NYC are investigating potential flaws that may be exploited by organized criminals involved in such heists and urging the Metropolitan Museum of Art to reconsider its policies regarding displaying high-value artwork. 

Meanwhile, officials from Interpol have begun an international operation involving various law enforcement agencies across nations where Dufresne's paintings had previously been exhibited or sold since her notorious heist in Paris two years prior with a still missing piece titled "Veil of Time." As the Metropolitan Museum searches for clues and potential suspect, art experts are expressing their grief at such brazen disregard to cultural treasures worldwide.

"It's shocking," says Professor Charles Beaumont from The New York University Tisch School of the Arts who adds his voice among thousands calling out against organized crime targeting museum pieces in general, and highlighted this incident as a wake-up call for authorities to take action at an international level. "I hope we see swift justice done."

As patrons grapple with emotions over what seems like senseless theft that took place within their city's cultural heart, Metropolitan Museum of Art President Gregory Hawthorn vowed in a subsequent statement: "We are actively working to recover 'Whispers on Canvas', and will keep our community updated as we investigate this crime. We believe it is crucial for us all to stand together at such times."

The stolen painting has been prominently featured across various media outlets, with art critics discussing the significance of its disappearance in broader conversations about cultural heritage security worldwide and emphasizing a need for global cooperation between law enforcement agencies.
