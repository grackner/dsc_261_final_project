In a dramatic turn of events yesterday in Venice, Italy, reports surfaced claiming that an unexpected and powerful tidal wave struck one of its busiest waterways, the Grand Canal, during peak tourist season on July 15th. The phenomenon was not predicted by local meteorologists who had no recordings indicating such activity this year; however, global warming experts are warning it may become more common due to rising sea levels and increasingly erratic weather patterns caused by climate change.

The tidal wave reportedly hit the heart of Venice's bustling city center near St. Mark’ end square at around 1:30 PM, when most tourists were either sightseeing or having lunch outdoors in their water-based cruisers known as gondolas and vaporettos – motorized boats that are a mainstay of the local transport system.

Visitors expressed fear on social media platforms with many sharing photographs, videos and testimonies from locals and tourists alike describing panic and chaos after being thrown off their vessels by unexpected wave currents rushing into St. Mark’ end square at unprecedented force – the first recorded instance of such a disturbance in Venice's history dating back to its founding as a city-state more than 1,500 years ago.

"I was enjoying my gelato on Rialto Bridge when suddenly I heard an eerie sound like water rushing towards me from below," said Sarah Jenkins of Los Angeles who had just arrived in Venice last week for her honeymoon with husband Jack Thomson, also visiting the city. "It scared us so much we jumped out and ran into St Peter's Basilica to seek shelter."

"I never thought I would see something like this," said Antonio Rossi, a lifelong Venetian who has lived on Grand Canal for over 30 years now that he runs his family-owned gondola shop. "The locals here are worried about the future of our beautiful city."

Local authorities confirmed to CNN Italian their immediate plans include evacuating residents living near waterfront properties, relocating some businesses temporarily and conducting a full assessment into how such an event can be prevented in the future. They also expressed gratitude towards international scientific experts who arrived yesterday from Germany eager to provide help with analyzing potential causes of this natural disaster which they describe as unprecedented for Venice – dubbed 'The Floating City' due its intricate waterways and historic architecture built on top marshy islands in the Adriatic Sea.

"We were not expecting such an event, especially at a time when we are already facing challenges related to high tourism numbers combined with environmental factors," Mayor Luigi Ferrari told DailyMail reporters after inspecting damage near St. Mark’ end square where some historic buildings displayed fresh cracks on their plaster walls caused by the force of water rushing through streets – scenes that echoed images from devastating earthquakes seen in other parts across Europe and Asia over recent years due to seismic activity linked directly with human-driven climate change.

"This could be a wake-up call for us as Venetians if we want our city, which has been built around waterways since its foundation by the Romans 2000 years ago - now undergoing rapid urbanization due to increased tourism and economic growth – not
