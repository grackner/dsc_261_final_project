Five teenagers from a local high school basketball team were pulled over on suspicion of DUI just hours before an important regional tournament in Phoenix last Friday evening. The boys, aged between 16 and 18 years old, are facing charges that could put their sports careers at risk as the community demands better education for young drivers amidst rising concerns about drunk driving accidents involving minors on weekends near sporting events.

The group of friends from Mountain View High School were spotted leaving a popular nightspot in downtthy late-night hours when officers noticed erratic behavior and suspected alcohol consumption while they fled the scene in their vehicle, which matched the description provided by patrons at The Barrel's Pub near 5th Avenue. Officers apprehended them after conducting blood tests on Saturday morning that confirmed BAC levels above legal limits for all five teens inside one of their vehicles parked nearby.

"We caught these kids in a pretty bad situation," said Officer Daniel Rodriguez, who was part of the team responsible for arresting the boys at 3:05am after they failed to stop when signaled by siren and flashing lights from patrol cars on Route M18. "It's heartbreaking to see young lives hanging in balance due to careless actions, especially since this incident occurred just days before a big tournament where these kids were supposed to shine."

The Regional Junior Basketball Tournament brings together hundreds of talented players from across Arizona competing for college scholarships and professional contracts. The five teens involved had secured spots on their respective teams through rigorous tryouts held earlier this month at the Phoenix Convention Center, where Coach Lisa Johnson said she hoped all her team members would prioritize safety above anything else: "It's a competitive world out there for our young athletes," stated coach Johnson. "But they should never lose sight of their responsibility to themselves and others when it comes to drinking."

Members of the local community, including parents of participating players as well as fellow basketball enthusiasts from different backgrounds, have rallied behind calls for a more comprehensive education program that focuses on preventing impaired driving among young people. "I am shocked and saddened by this incident," said Maria Hernandez, mother to one of the boys involved in court hearings set next week at Phoenix Municipal Court's Juvenile Division. "This is just so far from what I imagined for my son before he started playing with our basketball team."

"There are serious risks young drivers face when they mix drinking and driving," said Dr. Alan Cooper, a psychiatrist specializing in adolescent behavior at Phoenix Children's Hospital, who supports the push for stricter policies on youth-related alcohol use near sporting events: "While we understand that teenagers can feel invincible when they think about having fun with friends and celebrations after games or practice sessions - it is essential to emphasize safe behaviors consistently."

Next steps will include the local high school's basketball program administration reviewing its stance on alcohol-related activities during off-days, while city officials also promise stricter enforcement of DUI laws near venues known for hosting post-game celebrations. The boys are expected to attend court hearings next week where judges will make rulings and decide upon potential penalties that could range from probation periods with strict conditions set by parents, mandatory
