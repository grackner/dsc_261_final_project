Dam in Bihar crumbles as death toll rises; over 20 dead and hundreds evacuated amid heavy rains | World News by CNN-IBN

A dam failure in eastern India has led to the loss of at least 20 lives with several others injured. The disaster struck late yesterday near Baghmara village, about 65 miles northeast of Patna, Bihar's capital city, where heavy rainfall caused extensive flooding and sent waters surging towards populated areas.

"This is one of the worst dam collapses in years," said a local official who wished to remain anonymous due to safety concerns about speaking out publicly during this critical time. "The government has been working for months now, but it seems our efforts were not enough."

According to witness accounts and emergency services personnel on-site, the dam burst around 7 p.m., with an estimated rush of water measuring more than a foot in height reaching local communities before subsiding slightly this morning. Residents described hearing loud noises that quickly grew into panic as they were swept away by swolthy waters; some who managed to survive have been sharing their horrific experiences on social media platforms, hoping for justice against those responsible for the dam's upkeep and maintenance or possible lapses in infrastructure safety regulations.

"We just heard a huge cracking sound before everything went dark," said Ramchandra Prasad, 45-year old resident of Kushtia district who narrowly escaped with his life along with that of two other family members on Sunday evening when disaster struck near their home town's outskirts. "I felt like the dam was about to burst any minute now."

Several families have been evacuated from areas inundated by floodwaters, which are expected to recede within days as rescue efforts continue and additional water channels open up nearby riverbeds for relief flows after heavy rains overnight. However, many fear their homes may never be inhabitable again; authorities had already warned that some properties could not meet necessary safety criteria due to age or structural integrity issues during earlier assessments of dams in the region following a period of unprecedented monsoon seasons last year causing record flooding across Bihar, India's largest and most populous northeastern state.

"We are doing our best with limited resources," said Chief Minister Nitish Kumar as he addressed reporters this afternoon in the capital city of Patna where an emergency operation center was established yesterday evening after multiple dams along river banks reported spillage concerns due to relentless downpours that saw upwards 40mm per hour rainfall overnight. "I urge everyone affected by these floods not to lose hope and come together as a community for support."

Experts warn about possible aftershocks or additional dam breaches in the region, given its history of unstable infrastructure amid rising concerns regarding climate change impacting natural disaster frequency. Residents living downstream are bracing themselves yet again while waiting anxiously on rescue efforts to begin; families have been advised not to return until their homes pass an intensive safety inspection by government-authorized engineers next week at the earliest as floodwaters continue recede and resilience plans for future prevention are underway.

"This tragedy should be a wakeup call," stated Union Minister of State
