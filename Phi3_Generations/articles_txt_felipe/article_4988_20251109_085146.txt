Amid concerns over national sleep deficiency levels, a groundbreterm study reveals that insufficient sleep has pervasive impact across demographics and geographical areas in the United States (USA), with one-third of adults getting less than seven hours on average daily. According to findings published by The Sleep Research Society's latest report dated March 15, experts estimate that about two million Americans face health issues due directly or indirectly to poor sleep habits as the country enters its busiest period during summer break and holidays in recent years with increased stress on work-life balance.

Researchers from various academic institutions collaborated for this extensive study spanning four continents, interviewed over 10,000 participants ranging between ages of eighteen to sixty across major cities including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Houston as well as in smaller metropolitan areas like Boise (ID), Austin (TX) among others. "The data clearly suggests that a national sleep deprivation problem is not just about bedtime behavior but also related deeply with work-related stress which seems to be getting more prevalent day by day," says lead researcher Dr. Emily Chen, director of the Sleep and Health Institute at Harvard University's School of Public Health in Boston (MA).

The report highlighted that sleep quality is worse among those working overtime with full-timers reporting about 67% better rest compared to their counterparts clocking extra hours weekly. "We found a strong correlation between longer work weeks and decreased satisfaction levels, which directly affects our ability for adequate rest," shares Michael Roberts who heads up the American Academy of Sleep Medicine's National Work-Life Balance Program in Chicago (IL). 

Aside from lifestyle factors such as dietary habits or exercise routines that could influence sleep, several economic pressures have been pinpointed like job security concerns and wage stagnation. "People are worried about the economy more than they ever had before - it's causing a lot of anxiety leading them to work longer hours in fear of losing their jobs," notes psychologist Dr. Laura Thompson from New York University’s Department of Psychology who has been studying sleep disorders for over two decades.

The findings have prompted calls within various professional sectors, including technology firms like Apple Inc., Microsoft Corporation and Amazon's online retail platform to revise their policies on remote work as well as employee health benefits concerning physical therapy sessions or cognitive behavioral training aiming at improving sleep hygiene. In Washington D.C (DC), Congresswoman Laura Wilson has introduced legislation called the Comprehensive Sleep Health Bill, which aims to encourage employers of all sizes across industries nationwide take initiative towards facilitating better work-life balance and wellness programs for their employees as part of corporate social responsibility.

Following these findings in March 2023 with experts cautioning that if left unchecked, the sleep deprivation could worsen mental health problems leading to fatal consequences such as heart disease or stroke - prompting immediate action from policy makers and employers alike before it's too late for millions of Americans.

As we move into summer months ahead with holidays around Memorial Day (May 29th) on the horizon, one hopes that increased awareness about this critical issue can bring forth a positive change in society as individuals
