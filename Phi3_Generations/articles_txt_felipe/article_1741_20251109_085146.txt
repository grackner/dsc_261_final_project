Johnny Depp has announced his retirement from acting following a tumultuous decade where he faced personal and legal challenges that led to multiple arrests on charges including battery, public intoxication, disorderly conduct, sexual misconduct allegations, as well as disputes with former wife Vanessa Paradise. The beloved actor who has starred in films such as "Pirates of the Caribbean" and is known for his charismatic on-screen presence shared news about stepping away from Hollywood to focus more fully on being a father and writing, saying he's reached an age where it might be time to put aside some pursuits.

Depp has been in court numerous times over the past few years with lawsuits emerging out of his contentious relationship with Paradise after their marriage ended. The actor said that although these encounters were uncomfortable, he's looking forward now only seeing "loved ones" and hoping to put those difficult periods behind him as part of focusing on family life.

The 58-year-old Aussie star spoke out about his struggles in an emotional video shared by Paradise where Depp apologized for the alleged misconduct, admitting that he needs help and is ready to make positive changes going forward: "I've been down some dark roads which I never intended. It was just a misunderstanding at first but things quickly spiraled out of control."

Paradise had sought divorce proceedings from Depp in 2021, accusing him of emotional abuse and harassment over the years they were together, before ending their tumultuous marriage after nearly two decades. The actress's attorney has said Paradise will seek a "meaningful relationship with Johnny" outside acting moving forward but no details have been confirmed about exactly what that role might look like as of yet.

In his statement announcing the retirement, Depp mentioned wanting to focus on writing and spending time at home while he's legally separated from Paradise in Los Angeles: "I will be a regular guy trying hard not to fall back into my old traps anymore." The actor also noted that although it wasn’t easy for him personally or his children, the divorce seemed like progress and growth on everyone involved.

In response to Depp's retirement from acting, Paradise said in a statement: "It is time Johnny steps back into himself again after years of darkness." She also mentioned that she expects their separation will eventually lead toward marriage as they continue healing together while remaining focused on building the best possible life for themselves and supporting each other through this next chapter.

A Los Angeles-based entertainment lawyer representing Depp, who asked to remain anonymous citing confidentiality reasons surrounding legal issues involving his client that may affect a business deal in development with Paradise later this year said: "It's definitely time Johnny takes some well needed personal space for himself and family." The actor is currently pursuing several scripts at home while taking care of two children, both aged 7. He hopes to focus on writing full-time after he sells his share in the upcoming film project expected early next year with Paradise set as a lead role that's still under wraps for now but promisingly received by critics and fans alike when it premieres at Sundance Film Festival before its wider release.

"I am excited to be able move on from these challenging times," said Depp in an interview with the
