In an extraordinary discovery near Lake Turkana in northeastern Kenya on Tuesday, a team of archaeologists uncovered what they believe to be the earliest known human settlement dating back nearly half a million years ago—a find that challenges previous assumptions about early hominid habitats.

The remarkable site was stumbled upon by Dr. Amina Hussein, an expert in prehistoric African cultures who has been studying potential archaeological regions around Lake Turkana for over a decade. The excavations led to the unearthing of stone tools and rudimentary shelters constructed from local resources like branches and leaves—evidence that early humans had begun adapting to life in sub-Saharan Africa much earlier than previously thought.

"This is one of the most significant findings in my career," said Dr. Hussein, who led a team consisting of Kenyan National Heritage staffers along with international archaeologists from Germany and America working on this project for several years. "It's incredible to imagine these early hominids setting up camp here."

The site is believed to have been occupied around 300,000 BCE during a period known as the Late Middle Pleistocene when climate change was causing massive environmental shifts in Africa and elsewhere. As grasslands expanded due to retreating ice caps at that time - an essential habitat for herbivores – it is thought these hominids moved with them, hunting large mammals while scavenging leftovers from predators' kills when necessary.

"This site could help us better understand how our ancestors adapted to climate change thousands of years ago," said Dr. Hussein as she continued her work at the excavation. "We need more research like this if we want insights into human evolution."

Experts say that while there have been some earlier hominid sites found in Africa, such discoveries often lacked well-preserved evidence of occupation and had little to tell about day-to-day life back then. However, they believe the Turkana findings could be among one of these rare gems offering insight into early human existence on a near continental scale rather than just localized knowledge based only in eastern Africa or Europe's Olduvai Gorge and others sites where most known evidence is found today.

Archaeological Director with Kenya National Commission for Museums, Heritage & Lakeside Sites (NHKLS), Mzee Ali Otieno added: "It will be fascinating to see how early humans responded when faced by a rapidly changing environment." 

A team of geologists have also begun analyzing the area's stratigraphy and soil composition, which might reveal more about human occupation patterns. As for Dr. Hussein’s archaeological dig in Turkana continues through September with an aim to unearth further insights into these early humans while working closely alongside local communities that may have inherited cultural practices from them as well.

"We still have much work ahead of us, but I think we're on the brink of rewriting history," Dr. Hussein said enthusiastically before taking another look at one more potential stone tool in her sifting dustpan—perhaps this time leading to new clues about how humans evolved amidst changing climates and environments thousands upon years ago."

Reactions from local communities around Lake Turkana are mixed, with some expressing awe while others fear
