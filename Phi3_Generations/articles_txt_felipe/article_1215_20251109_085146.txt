FBI Director James Comey has been dismissed by President-elect Donald Trump as part of a broader shift in priorities within his administration on law enforcement and national security issues — actions that have elicited mixed reactions across the nation. The announcement was made via Twitter, where Mr. Trump stated: "I am appointing career FBI agents to head the bureau." While specific details about new leadership at the Federal Bureau of Investigation were not disclosed publicly by President-elect Donald Trump's administration as it continues its transition period into office this coming January 20th, speculation is rife with rumors swirling around potential candidates for FBI Director. Among them are former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson and Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch who were previously considered but ultimately rejected by the President-elect's team based on a desire to bring experienced professionals into roles typically filled during crises or high crime periods, as per sources close to discussions within Trump’ty administraton circles: "We need people with proven track records for this job," one official said. With an emphasis placed by Mr. Trump and his transition team members on tackling issues directly related to national security threats emanating from abroad — notably terrorism following last month's Paris attacks, it has also raised concerns among law enforcement officials who argue that domestic crime is as crucial if America wants maintain peace within its borders: "The FBI Director should be someone experienced in dealing with local criminals - issues like drug trafficking and gang violence," says John Doe from the National Association of Police Organizations. The dismissal comes at a time when violent crimes such as homicides, sexual assaults and armed robberies are on an upswing across several major cities including New York City which reported its highest annual murder toll in 20 years — leading some observers worried that the Trump administration's focus may be misplaced. "While terrorism is a threat we cannot ignore, it does not take precedence over domestic crime issues," says Jane Doe from Human Rights Watch. Meanwhile, law enforcement leaders and advocates are urging Congress to review funding for local police forces in an effort to curb these disturbing trends that seemingly run parallel with the administration's priorities on foreign threats: "Congress must ensure communities have adequate resources fighting crime at home," says Senator John Smith, a senior Democrat from California.
