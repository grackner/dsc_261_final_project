A massive blizzard that paralyzed travel across New England has finally subsided with temperatures set to rebound by tomorrow morning according to AccuWeather forecasters. The winter storm dubbed "Blaze" swept through the Northeast this past weekend, bringing heavy snow and frigid wind chill factors that made conditions perilous for travelers trying their luck on roads in states like New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine, and Massachusetts from Friday night into Sunday afternoon.

As of Monday morning, hundreds of thousands remain without power with at least 30 confirmed deaths resulting directly or indirectly due to the storm's ferocity across these four hard-hit regions since it was first sighted on November 12th near Newfoundland Canada before rapidly intensifying and veering south. More than half a meter of snow in places like Albany, Maine; Portsmouth, NH; Worcester, MA caused widespinished havoc across the region while cities were blanketed with an average depth between 18 to24 inches (50 cm) throughout New England.

"It's a miracle that we made it out without any harm or loss," said Sarah Johnson from Vermont, who was stranded in her home for over two days after losing electricity and heat due to the storm on November 17th as snow piled up by feet each day. "We had some elderly relatives staying with us too so it's not just physical but emotional fatigue," Johnson added, recounting how difficult living in such harsh conditions was for everyone involved while waiting helplessly for rescue crews to arrive amidst the whiteout snowfall outside her window.

As authorities scrambled throughout Sunday night and into Monday morning responding rapidly as rescues were conducted through treacherous driving conditions, a National Guard unit dispatched by Gov. Chris Sununu arrived in New Hampshire yesterday afternoon bearing food supplies meant to assist stranded residents waiting for power restoration crews who might not arrive until sometime after 12:00 pm on November 24th (EST) per the Public Service Department of Eversource Energy Co. "We are working around-the-clock and doing everything we can," a spokesperson said, though acknowledging that recovery efforts were moving slowly due to road closures caused by fallen trees or damaged infrastructure from blizzard conditions throughout New England last weekend which killed at least two people when 70mph winds blew down power lines and sent snow drifts into houses on roofless land.

With temperatures expected to rise gradually in coming days, the recovery effort will continue with crews focusing their attention toward reopening roads where possible while checking infrastructure for any damage that could result from melted ice or frozen pipes due inside homes once weather permits further assessment and repair. The blizzard is a sober reminder of how quickly Mother Nature can turn deadly when conditions become hazardous, with officials urging all residents in future events to take extreme caution if deciding whether traveling during severe winter storms should ever be considered safe again for themselves or loved ones affected by potential power outages brought on due natural disaster scenarios involving heavy snowfalls and ice accumulations.
