AUSTIN – A high school soccer team from Austin was left devastated last night when a serious injury to one of their star players during practice led them into an immediate medical emergency and subsequent hospital stay for the duration of this weekend's tournament in Houston, Texas. The incident occurred at 4 pth Wednesday afternoon on Cameron Field as Coach Emily Rodriguez was demonstrating a new play when suddenly team captain Alex Torres collided with another player from opposing school and fell awkwardly to the ground after losing control of their soccer ball near goalkeeper stands.

“The moment I saw what happened, my heart dropped,” said Coach Emily Rodriguez as tears formed in her eyes during a press conference on Thursday morning at Austin High School's auditorium where they were hosting the Texas State Championship semi-final match. “Alex has been an inspiration to us all since joining our team four years ago, and his absence is deeply felt.”

Medical staff quickly attended Alex’s side while other players gathered anxiously nearby as a large crowd watched from their bleachers for Austin High School soccer fans in the audience of over 300 people. Emergency medical technicians transported him to Memorial Hermann Hospital, where radiologists confirmed that he suffered not only broken bones but also serious soft-tissue damage around his knee cap and ankle area according to their report released yesterday afternoon by hospital spokesperson Michael Harris."I can't even begin to express how shattered we are,” said Alex’s father, Robert Torres in a phone conversation with local media. “Alex was always more cautious than most players on the field.”

As per an official statement released last night by Austin High School Head Football Coach and Athletic Director Greg Simmons, all practices will be temporarily suspended until Alex returns to full health while both teams agree for no additional player from either side should practice with him during his recovery period. The final quarter of the semi-final match has been rescheduled since Austin High School sits in a tiebreaker spot at Texas State Soccer League's Division IV tournament and as their last game before Memorial Day weekend, it is an opportunity for them to win back one point against Houston Central University which would earn this team not only the division title but also send each player home with some bragging rights.

“There’s nothing like playing in front of your family while representing Austin High School,” said senior defender Maria Vasquez about feeling proud and honored to play for her school on such a special occasion as it has been ten years since they won their last title, “I know that Alex will be with us every step through this journey.”

The community’s reaction was immediate; in support of the Torres family who have always had an important presence at Austin High School and for soccer players everywhere. On social media pages dedicated to high school sports across Texas many posts shared on Facebook using #SupportAlexTorre started circulating after Alex's injury story went viral yesterday afternoon when videos showed his painful fall during the practice session as well as clips of sympathetic fans from around Austin and even Houston offering condolences through tears for this young man’s misfortune.

“Our thoughts are with you all, said by local Texas Governor Greg Abbott to both families in a statement shared via Twitter yesterday evening that read: “Alex Torres is one of the most talented players I had the pleasure meeting at my inauguration back
