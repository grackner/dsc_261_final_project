A heatwave sweeping through California is showing little signs of letting up as temperatures soared past historical averages this weekend with some locations experiencuring record-breaking highs. The relentless sun has raised concerns about the immediate and long-term effects on public health, agriculture, and infrastructure across the state which includes Los Angeles to San Francisco along its lengthy coastline spanning more than 1,000 miles (about 1,609 kilometers).

As of Friday afternoon local time in the Sierra Nevada region — where snowfall typically marks the start of winter and spring thaw follows — there has been no significant precipitation since October. The lack of rain has left these areas parched while temperatures remain persistently above 75 degrees Fahrenheit (24 Celsius) for consecutive days, disrupting normal seasonal patterns according to data from the National Weather Service Los Angeles International Airport and weather stations in nearby mountain towns like Lake Tahoe.

Drought conditions that have been steadily building over years now threaten not just water supplies but also increase risks of wildfires as dried-out vegetation ignites easily under such high heat, says Dr. Rachel Greenberg who specializes in climate change effects on ecosystems at the University of California Irvine's School of Public Health and Environmental Science Research Center (SPERC).

"We are currently experiencing one of our most severe drought episodes here since records began, with no significant relief from rainfall expected until well into next year," Greenberg tells CNN. "The situation calls for a coordinated response to ensure that water resources continue flowing and firefighters can do their jobs safely while also preparing communities along the foothills where fires pose an imminent threat."

In Los Angeles County, officials are already taking action by issuing mandatory conservation measures as reservoir levels near historic lows due to reduced rainfall this season and increasing evaporation rates caused by rising temperatures. A representative from county public works tells the Daily Mail that water supply is being closely monitored every day at various locations including along rivers, streams, lakes, underground aquifers as well as large open-air tanks used for drinking supplies among others while emergency plans are in place should drastic measures become necessary.

"While we understand the frustration and inconvenience that these restrictions may cause some residents, they are absolutely essential to ensure our water supply is managed sustainably," says Supervisor Hilda Sanchez who leads environmental affairs for her district encompassing parts of downtown LA as well as several affluent communities. "We know the drought will take a significant emotional and economic toll on many people, but we all must do our part."

Experts like Greenberg warn that such prolonged dry spells are becoming increasingly common in California due to climate change which has led researchers at SPERC last year predicting an unprecedented three consecutive years of below-average rainfall and above 90 degree Fahrenheit (32 Celsis) temperatures across much of the state beginning with this summer season.

"It is clear that we are facing a changing climate in California, one which brings harsher summers than ever before," Greenberg tells CNN adding there was evidence to suggest some drought patterns may become more persistent and last longer due changes made by global warming on Pacific Ocean weather systems controlling precipitation.
