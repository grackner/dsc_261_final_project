Severan High School basketball team celebrated a hard-fought win in Friday's regional final at The Pavilion Arena located within Monroe County borders last Thursday evening. Led by coach Marcus Green and featuring the standout performances of senior point guard Alex Carter, SHS clinched their spot for national tournament qualification with an 82–76 victory over Central High School after prolonging a grueling game into double overtime on Sunday night at The Pavilion Arena in Monroe County.

Alex Carter took charge from the get-go as he spearheaded SHS's early lead, demonstrating his remarkable defensive skills by intercepting three passes and turning them into successful shots for their teammates during critical moments of play throughout Friday night’s regional semifinal matchup against Northridge High. “The ability to disrupt the opponent's flow is just as important in basketball,” stated Carter, whose relentless pursuit set a fierce tone on opposing teams from day one while his consistent ball-handling skills allowed for swift transitions between offensive and defensive plays—an essential factor throughout their successful run.

Central High's head coach Robert Clarkson expressed disappointment at the loss of what was predicted to be an intense game: "We had a great team, but we just couldn't maintain our focus when it mattered most." Despite that setback in Saturday’s semifinal against Monroe County rivals Oakridge Academy with 108 points scored between both teams throughout the night. It was SHS Senior guard Taylor Hayes who ultimately delivered for her team during Sunday evening as she rose to prominence after converting an impossible shot from behind half-court line on a play that extended overtime and secured national tournament berth victory in dramatic fashion—a sight not forgotten by spectators or witnessed live streaming broadcasts online since the match's resumption.

In discussing how this win brings SHS into contention for regional titles once more, Director of Basketball Operations Susan Wilson said: "The passion and determination shown on Sunday was nothing short of inspiring; I couldn’t be prouder." While acknowledging that each player's individual hard work contributed significantly to the team’s win streak alongside coach Marcus Green leading by example.

Furthermore, as preparations for national tournament finals commence in Las Vegas next month after SHS secured 3rd place at last year's championship due largely on their defensive strength displayed throughout regional playoffs including Friday night when Central High was defeated; the team has been training dilig0gently following a tough semifinal run against Oakridge Academy.

As excitement builds among students and faculty alike in anticipation of these national finals, many see this victory as not only an opportunity for SHS to once again prove themselves on such large stages but also bring recognition from other school divisions within the region where basketball is revered deeply rooted culture - something that was sorely needed after experiencing their first defeat since 2016.

Even so, coach Marcus Green remains focused solely on preparing for nationals next month emphasizing his prioritization of individual growth alongside team success saying: "We must remember there’s always room to improve ourselves personally and as a unit if we want any chance at excellence in frontlines." As SHS gears up, they will carry the lessons learned from their successful regional run with them for continued dominance on future competition stages.
