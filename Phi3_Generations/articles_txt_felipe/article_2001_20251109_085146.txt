A devastating fire broke out at a historic mill in County Durham, England yesterday evening around 6 PM local time. The flames engulfed one of Northern Ireland's last remaining water-powered mill complexes that dates back to the early 19th century and had been preserved as part of heritage efforts since its closure years ago due to lack of funds for maintenance in April [insert Year].

Firefighters from nearby stations were dispatched immediately after receiving a distress call at around 6:45 PM. The fire department reported that it took nearly five hours, until late evening into the early hours (around midnight), to bring it under control and prevent any loss of life or escapee animals such as farm goats kept in adjacent fields which often seek refuge from loud noises during thunderstorms - an incidentual but noteworthy detail brought forth by a local resident.

County Durham Fire Service Commander, David Williams said "It's disheartening to see any heritage site damaged beyond repair due to years of neglect." He added that efforts were underway for securing funds from both government grants and private donations aimed at restoring the mill complex back up once again.

The cause behind this tragic event has yet to be confirmed but local authorities suspect it might have been an electrical short-circuit triggered by some faulty wiring within the dilapidated property that had not seen any repairs for almost two decades [insert Year]. A spokesperson from Durham County Council said, "As one of Britain's last industrial heritage sites deteriorating without proper maintenance was a ticking time bomb waiting to explode."

Civil Engineer and consultant for restoration projects David Taylor commented: “It is saddening as many believed it was one step away from being fully operational again after all these years.” Despite the tragedy, he noted that this event may serve as an awakening call among locals to prioritize heritage preservation and raise funds towards similar historical sites in other parts of England facing neglect.

The community has rallied around those responsible for maintaining such treasures with petitions circulating online demanding better care from government bodies while private donations are pouring into crowdfunded campaigns to help restore the mill complex back again – proving that it does take a village after all when preserving one's cultural legacy.
