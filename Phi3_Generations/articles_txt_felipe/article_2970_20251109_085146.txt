In a bold display of solidargy and strength across borders in Africa today on September 15th, regional leaders from Ethiopia to Djibouti participated in peace talks aimed at resolving the simmering tensions that have long divided their nations along ethnic lines. The high-stakes summit convened with an urgency brought about by recent escalating conflicts and growing concerns for civilian safety within several Ethiopian regions, including Oromia, Amhara, Afar, Benishangul-Gumuz, and the Somali regional states which have a substantial impact on Djibouti's national security.

The meeting was held at Addis Ababa Sheraton Hotel with leaders such as Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed in attendance alongside his counterparts from affected regions of Tigray, Afar, Oromia, Somali and Amhara states who are all tasked to negotiate peace between the communities. 

The tensions have intensified since November last year when a separatist movement began within Ethiopia's predominantly Christian Tigray region located in the northern part of the country near Eritrea border which has seen armed clashes that resulted into thousands being internally displaced and tens to hundreds of fatalities on both sides.

Speaking with reporters following today’s summit, Ethiopian Foreign Minister Demeke Tsegga expressed his hope for lasting peace: "The time is now ripe not just within Africa but around the world - it's high that Africans take charge of their continent without looking to outside forces."

In Djibouti as well, concerns are rising due to proximity and shared history with Ethiopia. The neighbor’s political instability has caused a wave of refugees seeking safety in its densely populated capital city. Amidst this crisis, the government along with international humanitarian organizations strive to provide much-needed aid and support for those displaced by violence on both sides.

"I believe that these talks are critical if we wish our people not only stability but also respect from their own nation," said Djibouti's Foreign Minister, Mahamoud Ali Youssouf during a news conference at the regional summit in Ethiopia this afternoon. He went on to say: "It is time for Africans and neighboring countries alike come together - let us unite not just against conflicts but also celebrate our continent's strength."

While optimistic, experts caution that progress toward resolution will be challenging given historical animosities between these diverse ethnic groups. Ethiopian anthropologist Selamawit Taye warns of the long road ahead: "The issues at hand here are deep-seated and generations old - it's going to take patience, understanding, consistent dialogue as well as goodwill on both sides in order for true peaceful resolution."

As these talks progress over coming months into years, Africa watchers remain hopeful yet cautiously optimistic about a lasting solution. Observers across the continent and around globe will continue to keep their fingers crossed that this meeting marks not just another diplomatic attempt at quelling violence but an opportunity for communities to heal wounds of decades-long animosity, rebuild relationships on mutual respects with each other - as Africans.
