A soccer fan in Manchester was injured during a post-match brawl on Saturday night at Old Trafford stadium as reported by local authorities and witnesses. The incident took place just outside the south stand shortly before midnight, when overzealous supporters of Chesterfield F.C., after their team had lost 2–0 to Manchester United, clashed with fans wearing Union blue in an unexpected turn of events at a major soccer derby match between two local rivals and created chaos that involved police intervention for the first time this season.

Witnesses reported seeing several heated confrontations erupt as some Chesterfield supporters, not accustomed to playing against their city's team in such a high-profile derby game at home under intense rivalry pressure, threw bottles and debris after the final whistle blew. In response, Manchester United fans took matters into their own hands by confronting offending supporters outside of Old Trafford’s boundaries when stadium security struggled to keep up with the growing tension between groups in attendance for what was considered a regular season fixture at least three years prior but now appears more like an unforeseen battleground.

Authorities, including Manchester City Council and local law enforcement agencies who usually witness such confrontations during mid-weekend games or matches involving smaller clubs with no significant stakes in play on either side of the divide between Greater Manchester’s two soccer powerhouses have been dispatched to restore peace among fans after a series of altercations at Saturday night's derby game led by Chesterfield supporters outside stadium walls left one unlucky fan hospitalized with multiple fractures. The Metropolitan Police confirmed they had arrested three individuals believed connected directly or indirectly via their social media presence linked to the brawl, but details regarding charges and potential sentences remain unclear pending further investigations into how local rivalries grew from normal pre-match bantering during this season’s most anticipated matchup between two teams with historic significance in Greater Manchester's soccer history.

“We are treating a fan who is critically injured following Saturday night altercations outside Old Trafford,” said a spokesperson for the MUFC (Manchester United Football Club). “The club stands united against any acts of violence or disruption to fans' safety, and we will continue working closely with law enforcement agencies."

A representative from Chesterfield confirmed that their players were unaware when confrontation began as they left the pitch at 2:01am local time on Saturday (5 AM ET), saying in a press conference later that evening held by club officials after witnesses arrived, “We regret any actions taken and will do our best to maintain peace moving forward."

Several fans of both clubs were seen exchanging heated words moments before the confrontations erupted outside Old Trafford's perimeter barriers where supporters from Chesterfield initially gathered post-match, with many attempting an aggressive rearguard push into territory already claimed by Manchester United blue on Saturday night. The initial clash occurred when a group of about 20 players and fans emerged as they left Old Trafford after their team's match against the Red Devils at Goodison Park, with some throwing objects such as bottles from behind closed stadium gates before being confronted by Union blue defenders who charged out to protect fellow Manchester
