Amidst rising tensions in Southeast Asia, naval forces from multiple countries conducted a series of joint exerdependent military maneuvers off the coast of Singapore this weekend. Naval ships and submarines engaged in live-fire drills as part of an ongoing effort to enhance interoperability among allied militaries within close proximity amid escalating regional security concerns, sources with knowledge of the event say.

The joint exercise was reportedly launched by defense officials from Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia at about 10 a.m. local time on Saturday near Port Dickson Bay off west coast Sabah state in northern Borneo island — some five miles away from disputed territory claimed both militarily and historically by China as well its semi-monthly naval patrols that are part of its increasing assertiveness around the South China Sea, experts say.

"Our joint drills today reflect a new commitment to upholding peace in our region," said Singapore's Deputy Minister for Defense Teo Ser Luck during opening remarks at Port Dickson Bay Naval Base after watching submarines launch torpedoes into the water near shore. "These exercises will allow us to deepen trust among allies and better secure shared waters in which we all have an interest."

"We've been working with these nations for years, building on a history of cooperation," said Malaysia's Minister for Foreign Affairs Saifuddin Nasuah at the same time. "Our goal is not confrontation but to show solidarity in times like this when Chinese activities are increasing and concerns over territorial integrity grow."

Sources say 30 countries have been invited so far by regional group ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) as well its allies, including Australia-US strategic partnership Quadrilateral Security Dialogue. The exercise is expected to run for several days and involves more than a dozen surface ships — mostly frigates but also destroyers and corvettes — helicopters, fixed wing aircraft, drones as well maritime patrol planes operating from multiple countries' air forces according to the sources.

"Our exercises will serve not only our own defense needs in this increasingly complex environment," said Indonesian Navy Chief of Staff Arman Suratman after observing a simulated naval battle at sea, "but also demonstrate unity among allies who share mutual interests and commitments."

The event marks the largest scale ASEAN military exercises since 2015 when Singapore hosted Exercise Lionfish as part of its contribution to efforts strengthening regional security amidst evolving territorial disputes with neighboring countries. Earlier this week, several nations in Asia — including China and Japan which have competitive interests over the resource-rich South East Asian waters claimed by both sides under differing interpretations based on historical treaties or through direct claims of sovereignty – released statements regarding escalating tensions around territorial concerns.

"It is time for ASEAN countries to stand firm against unilateral and coercive actions," said Malaysia's Foreign Minister Saifuddin Nasuah while stressing that his country supports the collective right of nations claiming sovereigny over certain territories in Southeast Asia, "The exercise is an opportunity for us to work together on finding peaceful solutions without resorting to violence or confrontation."
