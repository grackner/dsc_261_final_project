In a remarkable turn of events in Egypt's capital city Cairo on March 15th, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi announced his intention to resign effective immediately amid growing public discontent and health concerns due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The unprecedent decision came as he addressed thousands gathered for a national ceremony in Tahrir Square celebrating women's empowerment, which was then hastily adjourned following el-Sisi's unexpected announcement from his podium atop a horse cart adorned with Egyptian flags.

"It is not by choice that I am resigning today but under the great weight of my conscience and love for our beloved nation," stated President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi in an impromptu speech broadcast on national television networks across the country, leaving observers stunned. Egypt's Foreign Minister Khaled Azzouni echoed his sentiments: "Our respected leader has decided to resign out of a sense of duty and responsibility towards our people during this difficult time."

As Egypt navigates this challenging transition period amidst the pandemic and economic turmoil that has gripped much of the world in recent years - including its own North African neighbor nations such as Algeria, Libya, Sudan, Tunisia, among others; many wonder what lies ahead for a nation which he once proudly called home during his rise to power.

In response to this development and amid concerns about maintaining stability in the face of political changes at Egypt's highest echelons - Defense Minister Mahmoud Ahmed Miller assured national security while urging citizens "to unite their efforts for a stronger nation." 

It remains unclear what comes next as Cairo reels from this unexpected announcement, but world leaders and foreign affairs experts are closely monitoring Egypt's future direction in hopes that the
