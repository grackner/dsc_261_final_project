As of Thursday morning, thousands have descended on New York City for an unprecedented cultural and culinary festival set to span three weeks from May through July next year - drawing inspiration directly from the rich tapestry that is French cuisine alongside iconic Parisian street art. This international celebration will invite not just locals but also visitors far beyond city boundaries, all eagerly anticipating a unique blend of gastronomical delight and visual spectacle to enrich their New York experience like never before.

The event's organizer Jane Durocher shared her excitement about the coming festival in an exclusive interview with CNN Traveler: "We are thrilled at the opportunity presented by French culinary maestro, Chef André Rouxard and his team to introduce authentic gourmet delights right here in New York. We have curated a three-week journey that promises unparalleled flavor experiences for our visitors while paythyrax themes reflecting Paris's artistic flair will be interspersed throughout."

Celebrating the world of French cuisine is nothing new in New York, with numerous Michelin star restaurants and classic bistros dotting its landscape. But this festival promises to push boundaries while respectfully acknowledging heritage through a collaboration between Chef André Rouxard's award-winning restaurant 'Le Gourmet Parisien,' established across the river from Grand Central Terminal, with globally renowned French art collective La Maison d’Élodie known for its immersive installations throughout major metropolises. 

The festival will launch on May 15th at Le Gourmet Parisien and conclude just before Memorial Day in early June to give the event's finale - 'La Fête du Goût,' a three-day extravaganza featuring street food stalls, live performances by French jazz artists alongside intimate dining experiences – enough time for an unforgettable exploration.

A local resident and frequent festival attendee, Emily Thompson told DailyMail she couldn't wait to bring her family: "This is more than a culinary event; it’s cultural immersion - my son can sketch the art installations while I get lost in their flavors." 

For those who prefer an outdoor experience amidst nature, 'La Terre des Fruits,' another collaboration between French chefs and artists specializing in edible flowers has planned weekly picnics at different parks across Brooklyn. The program promises not just refined food but also a unique spectacle of colors that reflect the spirit of Parisian markets amidst New York's green spaces, an experience described by organizer Pierre Dubois as "an immersive taste and visual journey."

A prominent critic at 'La Palette Gourmet,' Vincent Leroy expressed caution: “It’s essential to remember that the best way of experiencing French culture is not through imitations but understanding its roots. As we explore this event, let us appreciate our surroundings and enjoy them as authentically possible.”

This unprecedented festival brings together culinary artistry from across New York City's diverse food landscape while immersing attendees in the vibrant world of French culture through a visually captivating platform that invites celebration, appreciation and exploration. As thousands are set to descend on NYC for this event, one must ask: Will it truly become New York City’s
