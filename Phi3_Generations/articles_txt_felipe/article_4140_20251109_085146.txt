A massive flood hit parts of West African nation Senegal on Thursday night, leaving thousands homeless and at least one person dead according to local officials. The rainfall started in the early evening and continued unabated for over twelve hours as meteorologists warned about potential flash floods weeks ago. 

The disaster struck primarily in Senegal's capital city of Dakar, but also affected nearby regions like Thies and Diourbel. Over a thousand people were rescued from rooftops by local fire departments as water levels rose dangerously high near residential areas along the Gossas River basin before receding early this morning with forecasted sunny weather on the horizon for tomorrow's weekend, officials said today.

Mayor of Dakar Alma Camara shared her concern about how long it would take to restore basic services: "We are doing our best under difficult circumstances; however we understand that many people will need support in recovering from this disaster." Local volunteer aid organizations have begun working around-theinite with government agencies and international NGOs like Save the Children, which delivered supplies such as food packets, blankets, tents, water purifiers to help provide immediate relief. 

Dr. Abdoulaye Sow of Dakar's Institute for Research in Meteorology recalls how this weekend flood was unlike any they had seen before: "Our models showed above-average rainfall expected during the monsoon season; however, none predicted such extreme levels." While he notes that climate change is likely playing a role by altering patterns of weather extremes across Africa as elsewhere in the world.

Senegal has suffered from several natural disasters over recent years including cyclones and locust invasions but this flood represents one of its most destructive to date, says Gérard Cissé an expert on urban planning at Dakar's Technical University who studies infrastructure resilience in Sub-Saharan African cities. He adds: "We need more research into the impact climate change has had upon our region - it is imperative if we are to better prepare and protect ourselves from such devastating events."

Aid agencies urge donations be sent directly through their verified channels on websites like GoFundMe or AmazonSmile, which ensures funds will reach those most in need. Residents who have had the worst impacted properties now face a long road to rebuild and recover amidst what is forecasted as an unusually hot weekend ahead with no sign of immediate relief from further rainfall but hope that Senegalese solidar0ty has not been diminished by this tragedy.

"I am grateful for the help so far; it's just hard to see my home like this, or what we lost will ever be restored," says local resident and mother of three Aminata Dione who had her living room flooded out overnight last night while she watched from a safe distance with fearful concern as water rose up around the house. "We're all trying to help each other clean-up; it takes time but we won't let ourselves be defeated by this."

Senegalese authorities vow their support for those affected and are working on plans to improve flood defenses, drainage systems as well steps toward better water management across the country. The President Abdoulaye Wade declared a state of emergency last night declaring: "We will recover together;
