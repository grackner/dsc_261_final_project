A soccer tournament in Madrid on Wednesday witnessed a shocking incident as an elite youth player collapsed during halftime with suspected heat exhaustion symptoms due to the scorching summer temperatures, which have soared above average across Spain this year. The match between Real Estudiantes and CD Alcarreña was halted for about 15 minutes after a medical team attended to Alejandro Hernández at his side of the pitch as he struggled with dizziness and fatigue amidst what had been an intense half-time warm-up session.

The heatwave affecting Spain this year has reached temperatures well above historical averages, creating risks not only for humans but also in outdoor sports activities. According to the Spanish Meteorological Agency's statistics from June 2023, Madrid experienced an average high of around 41 degrees Celsius (105.8 Fahrenheit), three degrees higher than usual since July records began a century ago.

"As dedicated athletes who strive for excellence in the sport they love, it's essential to prioritize health and safety," said Dr. Marta Sánchez, head of Sports Medicine at Universidad Complutense de Madrid, where Hernández had previously been training alongside other top prospects from across Europe before his participation in Spain’s youth leagues. "The conditions we are experiencing with the ongoing heatwave make it even more crucial for everyone to stay vigilant about their physical well-being."

Hernández, a rising star and an aspiring professional player at Real Madrid Juvenil squad who hails from Almería in Andalusia's southern region of Spain – one notorious area for blisteringly hot summers — has been actively encouraged by his coaches to regularly monitor hydration levels during practice sessions amid the ongoing heatwave.

His father, a local soccer pundit and former professional player who now works as Hernández’s personal trainer, expressed concern over the current weather conditions affecting not just their son's play but other young athletes in Spain: "With temperatures this high during training days or even games like today at Estadio Alfredo Di Stéfano - a place where passion for soccer runs through every player’s veins – it becomes imperative to take additional precautions. We need our players' health as much, if not more than their performance on the pitch."

The incident has led Real Madrid Juvenil and CD Alcarreña coaches to review practices in view of this year's abnormally high temperatures that are affecting Spain nationwide with no signs of respite. It also brought into focus how other countries worldwide, where summer is hotter than average for the time being due to global warming effects — such as Australia or South Africa - manage their respective soccer tournaments during peak-heat seasons: "We need a change in our approach towards organizing these outdoor sporting events. It's high time that we take this growing issue seriously and make necessary amendments before it affects the very spirit of youth sports."

In response to Hernández’s collapse, Madrid City Council has initiated discussions with soccer federations about how best practices can be adapted in light of extreme temperatures.
