Topic: Sports - Basketball

Senior citizens enjoy playing basketball at a local community center in Phoenix last Sunday as part of an initiative to promote sports for all age groups and improve physical health among elders. Over thirty players from different backgrounds joined the friendly match, which ended with laughter and high spirits despite some scraped knees on both ends.


"Basketball is not just a sport; it's about being active together," said Marjorie Hernandez, one of the participants who regularly attends games at Sunshine Community Center since 2th September when they started organizing weekend events for all age groups to come and play. "It keeps us young in spirit too."


The initiative began last year after local authorities noticed a significant drop in physical activity among senior citizens, which was linked with an increase in health issues such as obesity and depression within the community of West Phoenix. Since then, they have successfully made basketball accessible to over 200 seniors aged between 65-85 years old by setting up open play sessions twice a week under supervision from trained staff members who ensure safety while allowing freedom for enjoyment on the court.


"We wanted our community elders like Margaret, George and Alice not just to sit around at home but come out regularly do something physical," said Bill Anderson, Parks Supervisor of West Phoenix Recreation Department responsible for this new addition in their calendar titled 'Golden Swing'. "The smiles on faces when they get back here are worth more than any trophy."


According to the American Heart Association's latest findings released last November, physical activities like basketball can significantly reduce heart-related risks and improve mental wellness among senior citizens. The study found that elderly adults aged 60 years or older who engage in regular exercise have a lower risk of developing depression by about 25%.


Dr. Sarah Thompson, Geriatrician at Sunshine Medical Center commented on these results: "As healthcare providers here we see tremendous benefits when our elderly patients come outdoors for sports activities such as basketball; not only are they keeping themselves physically fit and reducing risks of heart diseases but also getting an emotional boost which is so important in today's fast-paced world."


The senior citizen friendly initiative at Sunshine Community Center has received positive feedback from players, relatives and even local school children who occasionally join their games during lunch breaks. This unifying program encourages not only healthy habits but also intergenerational interaction where elders share wisdom with younger generations while getting to know them better as they cheer for or play against each other on the basketball court every weekend morning at 10:30 am starting from September when sunshine beams in full force.
