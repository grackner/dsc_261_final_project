A massive iceberg measuring over 25 square kilometers has broken off from Antarctica's Larsen C Ice Shelf and is now drifting toward South America with potential environmental concerns looming large for the continent as experts weigh in on possible consequences of this unusual event. The giant piece, one-fifth the size of New York City, separated early Saturday morning when a rift grew from several kilometers to over 300 meters across due to warming ocean temperatures and atmospherin conditions that have been causing increased ice shelf disintegration in recent years along Antarctica's coast.

The massive calving event caught the attention of scientists at Britain’s Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) who are closely monitoring it, as well as researchers from other parts of the world like Dr. Isabela Goncalves at Brazil's National Institute for Space Research in Sao Paulo where she works on ice-to-water transformation processes affecting South America's ecosystems and sea levels.

"It’s incredibly rare to see such a massive piece break off from an Antarctic Ice Shelf, let alone head towards another continent like it is now," said Goncalves in her statement on the unfolding event which she believes may pose potential flood risks for parts of South America.

The iceberg was already drifting at 3 kilometers per hour before encountering a warm current that could potentially speed up its journey towards Argentina’s northeastern provinces, according to Dr. Hiroshi Yamamoto from the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC).

“We can expect it arrive near Buenos Aires within two weeks if nothing changes in terms of ocean currents or atmospheric conditions,” said Yamamoto who has been working with his team to track this unprecedented occurrence through satellite imagery. “This is not something we have seen before, but I am sure the world will learn a lot from it.”

As environmentalists and scientists work to understand more about how warming temperatures are accelerating these large-scale breakups in Antarctica's ice shelves — sometimes referred to as "ice islands" due to their size— experts caution that the event raises serious questions on climate change impacting our planet today and for generations.

“We’ve been seeing more of this kind of activity along coastlines in recent years,” said Dr. Jane Smith, a glaciologist with Britain's NERC who has studied these events extensively over the past decade at field sites around Antarctica including Rothera Research Station on Adelaide Island near the Weddell Sea and McMurdo Station which serves as one of only two U.S.-owned permanent research bases in Antarctica located just north of Ross Island within New Zealand’s scientific claim territory (which overlays with that claimed by Britain, Australia).

Dr Smith believes it'll take years before we fully understand the impact this iceberg could have on South America—if at all—adding to a long list of consequences already being felt in various parts across Antarctica due largely because human activities continue releasing greenhouse gases into Earth’s atmosphere.

“This event highlights just how fast our planet is changing and shows us that the impacts aren't limited to one region," said Dr Smith who recently published research on ice shelf disintegration processes in Antarctica with her team at Cambridge University Press Journal
