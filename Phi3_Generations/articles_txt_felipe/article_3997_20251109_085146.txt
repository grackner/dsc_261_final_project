A local mindfulness initiative is gaining momentum in downtthy Crosstown as more and more people find solace amid economic turmoil. The Mindful Community Project (MCP), started last year, offers free weekend workshops on meditation techniques to reduce stress levels among residents struggling with financial anxieties due to the recent recession in Greensboro, North Carolina since April of this year.

The mindfulness classes are led by a team of certified instructors and therapists who believe that taking time for mental health is vital during challenging times. The initiative was launched with just eight participants at the beginning but has now grown to attract upwards of 50 people each weekend, according to MCP organizer Samantha Roberts.

"We're here not only because we want personal well-being but also for community building," says Roberts as she oversees a session with residents at the Crosstown Community Center on Saturday morning, September 10th. "When everyone around you is struggling financially and feeling stressed out about their future or job security... We're here to be each other’s support."

As unemployment rates in Greensboro continue to rise — currently standing at just under ten percent according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics data from September 20th, mindfulness practitioners say that taking control and focusing on one's own mental health is key. "Mindful meditation helps people find a sense of calm in their everyday lives," shares Dr. Emily Tran, who specializes in cognitive-behavioral therapy at the local hospital as well serving as an advisor to MCP. 

The program incorporates techniques such as deep breathing exercises and guided visualization aimed not only at promoting relaxation but also building resilience against life's uncertainties. "Many times, we have a negative impact on our well-being because of how much stress the current situation brings," explains Dr. Tran while facilitating an MCP workshop earlier this month with 45 attendees in attendance.

MCP's growth has been swift and impressive as they continue to gain support from local businesses, who see potential benefits for their own staff well-being, community engagement, retention rates -and ultimately boost morale amid trying economic times. "It is essential that we provide a safe space where people can come together and take care of themselves," shares the owner of an IT firm in Greensboro's Innovation Park who recently became involved as both participant and financial supporter, Joe Anderson with his company providing funding for materials used by instructors. 

As mindfulness becomes more popularized throughout mainstream media platforms — such as Oprah Winfrey’s recent talk on the benefits of meditation during this time period or Dr. Jon Kabat-Zinn's widely acknowledged teachings since his seminal Mindfulness in Medicine publication back in 1975, local initiatives like MCP offer a community approach to mental health maintenance which is growing more necessary with each passing day as we face the economic challenges ahead together.
