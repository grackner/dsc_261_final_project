**A Seasoned Playmaker’s Unconventional Route Leads Him Back Into the Football Arena**

After years spent refining his skills as a personal trainer in California, former NFL cornerback Derek Smith decided to return to college football this season by joining Southern Vermont University's (SVU) team. The 34-year-old’s decision has stirred excitement and intrigue among the SVU community members on Long Island last Wednesday as he officially joined their squad, which competes in NCAA Division III with a proud record of three national championships under its belt this year alone.

Smith spent his professional career playing for two seasons each at University of Michigan (1998–2000), Northwestern University and later the New York Giants from 2003 to 2005, where he was recognized as an All-Star during his tenure on Super Bowl champions. Now back in college football for a second round with SVU - Smith’s path diverges greatly from that of most former pro players who typically go straight into coaching or broadcasting after retirement— but this seasoned player still seeks to compete at the highest level possible, if only on a much smaller scale.

"I've always loved football and decided I wanted more fun with it rather than just watching," said Smith over breakfast last Thursday morning before attending his first practice session as SVU’s newest member since he joined late September due to scheduling conflicts between the NFL offseason workouts, personal training commitments in Los Angeles where one of them is located now working at a premier gym and completing preparations for this college season.

According to head coach Jim Henderson - who hired Smith specifically because "his passion for football hadn't diminished over years" — the 34-year old cornerback adds experience along with some much needed energy onto SVU’s team, which boasts an impressive array of recruits including three former All American players themselves: wide receivers Ryan Jackson (Rhode Island), Tyler Evans and quarterback Chris Brownson from UCLA.

"Derek brings a unique perspective to the game," says Henderson as he recalled Smith's professional highlights during an interview at his office situated near campus on Long Pond Drive - not far away from where former NFL players used to come for tailgates and catch-ups postseason celebrations decades ago. "He understands different aspects of the game — both offensively & defensively now that we're facing a new era with more passing games."

Coach Henderson says he expects Smith, who played mostly against Division I opponents in his professional career despite playing D-II as an undergraduate at Michigan himself and later graduating from Northwestern where the rest of his former NFL teammates studied on scholarships post-2001 BCS title game season — to help improve SVU's pass defense.
