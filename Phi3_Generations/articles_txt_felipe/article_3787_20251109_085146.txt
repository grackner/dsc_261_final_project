In a heart-wrenching incident that struck on Tuesday night in Beirut's Gemmayzeh neighborhood, three children lost their lives when an explosion set off by unchecked ammonium nitrate at the Port of Beirut rocked the capital. Amidst chaos and devastation, survivors recount tales of fear as blasts shook homes still mourning recent losses due to a relentless economic crisis that has gripped Lebanon since 2019.

The explosion at around 3:58 am local time shattered windows and crumbled walls in the densely populated port district, leaving an area resembling Ground Zero as it ripped through Beirut's heartland with a force felt up to two miles away from where the blast occurred. The Lebanese-American nonpromediate organization Save the Children issued reports of 16 children being injured and three confirmed dead — ages eight, ten, and twelve years old by some estimates.

"I was awoken in my home when we heard a tremendous sound...and then I saw dust rising from Gemmayzeh," shared Layla Touma, who sheltered with her family during the explosion. "We are all shaken beyond words."

The World Health Organization reported 42 individuals hospitalized due to physical injuries ranging from minor fractures and lacerations to severe head traumas requiring neurosurgery or intensive care treatment at local hospitals like the American University of Beirut Hospital. A United Nations spokesperson expressed outrage, calling for immediate international assistance in response efforts amid fears that unexploded ordnance from decades-old conflicts could pose further threats during emergency work to clear debris and restore infrastructure across a nation already enduring immense hardship due to persistent financial instability.

In an official statement released shortly after the disaster, Prime Minister Najib Mikati stressed that restoring normalcy was paramount while ensuring safety measures were in place for civilians amid ongoing protests against government mismanagement and corruption which have continued since October 2019 as Lebanon grapples with its worst economic crisis. "We are facing an unprecedented tragedy, but we will rise above this pain together," he vowed during a televised address last night to the nation from his office in downtown Beirut while emergency services worked tirelessly around-the clock providing aid and support for those affected.

The blast came hours after Lebanon's largest port, which is one of its most vital economic assets alongside tourism, has been largely dormant since 2019 as it attempts to recover from the shockwaves sent through by a banking crisis that led depositors taking flight over concerns regarding national currency stability and rampant inflation. Experts say Lebanon's financial woes began during its tenure with former Prime Minister Saad Hariri when then-President Michel Aoun decided not to renew his term due in part as retribution against a political deal that gave him significant influence but also because he felt marginalized following years of economic mismanagement by successive governments after decades without the experience of an elected official from Maronite Christianity serving as head-of-state.
