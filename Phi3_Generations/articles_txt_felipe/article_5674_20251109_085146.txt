Passengers at Terminal B expressed frustration over lack of communication regarding timelines or alternative arrangements being made by airline representatives. Some even complained about potential lost items within their checked luggage during such chaos.

The DOT emphasized transparency in this process to maintain public trust within American transportation infrastructure systems while ensuring future prevention of similar situations arising again anywhere else across US airports nationwide.

In response, JFK Airport Manager Tom Golisau said he was confident engineers would swiftly bring the disruption under control; however agreed there were lessons learned: "We can always strive for better communication with our guests during these challenging times". 

As passengers anxiously await updates on when their baggage will arrive, United Airlines continues to assure that every effort is being made within realms of human and technical possibilities. Passengers have been advised not to pack essential items in checked luggages but carry them instead as hand-carried belongings for potential travelers considering alternative airports should this issue persist or reoccur unexpectedly at some future point again, though experts agree these occurrences would be exceedingly rare if system and human management align perfectly.

It remains to see how much trust will need mending between passengers of United Airlines as they await answers from both the company itself along with investigations by federal agencies into what caused such a widespread disruption, which has since begun affecting travelers arriving at JFK Airport Terminal B and connecting flights nationwide.
