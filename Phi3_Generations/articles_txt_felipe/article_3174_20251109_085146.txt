A massive wildfire in California' endangered lives and properties last weekend as wind speeds increased to over hurricane levels causing rapid spread of flames across vast areas near Los Angeles County with officials urging evacuations for the first time since devastating fires struck Southern California three years ago. 
Reports from local weather stations confirmed that sustained gusts exceeded 80mph in some locations, reaching wind speeds comparable to a Category Five hurricane on Friday evening as firefighters battled dozens of active blazes across the region with temperatures soaring into triple digits.
"The situation is dire," said Chief Fire Marshal Jonathan Edwards during an emergency press conference yesterday where he advised evacuation procedures for nearby residents, citing a "significant risk to life and property". 
Evacuees lined up at designated shelters in Ventura County received water bottles, food packs, blankets, and hygiene kits from volunteers as they awaited further instructions on when it would be safe for them return home. "We understand how difficult this is," said Marisa Rodriguez, who evacuated with her family of three after hearing the news about wildfires in Los Angeles County via a local radio broadcast. 
"All we can do now is pray and hope that everyone stays calm." Since Monday morning when strong winds started to buffet across California's vast landscapes towards its densely populated cities, officials have been struggling with coordinating efforts between firefighters working in rugged terrain outside city limits while maintaining control within heavily forested areas where flames rage more intensively.
Drastic increases in wildfire occurrences over the past decade due to climate change and arson-related incidents, which have become a growing concern among communities at risk of exposure across vast swaths of rural America is an issue that scientists warn will only worsen as drought persists.
With several areas already being declared disaster zones by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) after assessments from aerial surveys, President Joe Biden spoke with Governor Gavin Newsom yesterday discussing possible federal assistance for those affected and urging his administration to expedite relief efforts on behalf of communities facing this life-threatening crisis.
"We are in the middle of one of America's most significant fires yet," he acknowledged, adding that "we must ensure we support our brave men and women fighting these flames." 
Mike Smithson with California State Fire Authority stated yesterday during an update meeting at LA County Fire Station Number Five where a small team of local firefighters are currently operating: The spread has doubled since Monday, but progress is being made as several containment lines have been established. "We continue to assess the situation and make real-time decisions with respect for each life," he stressed amidst fierce winds that had yet to let up in this Southern California city near Los Angeles where homes are on both sides of dense forest areas, which will take months if not years before they can return. 
"We have a long road ahead but the spirit and resilience within our community is unwavering."
