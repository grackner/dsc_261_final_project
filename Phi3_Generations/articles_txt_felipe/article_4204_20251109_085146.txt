Gold prices to soar as Fed signals rate hikes; Dow futures dip amidst market uncertainty in pre-market trading yesterday at Wall Street exchange saw gold futures leap by over $30 per ounce, while blue chips like Coca-Cola and McDonald's tumbled sharply.

With investors bracing for a Federal Reserve decision expected today that could signal the beginning of an interest rate hike cycle to curb inflation, gold is once again outperforming as a hedge against currency devaluation while stock market futures took their first step back from record highs last month.

"Gold has historically been viewed as a store of value during times when monetary policy becomes tight," explained Michael Greenwald, an investment strategist with Fidelity National Financial in New York yesterday afternoon before the market opened. "We anticipate that more conservative allocations will return to portfolios moving forward."

The precious metal has rallied 35% this year while stocks have tumbled amid concerns about inflation and rising interest rates, a sharp reversal from last decade's bull market which propelled shares higher at double-digit growth. Analysts suggest that the Fed will signal an aggressive policy of rate hikes later today to bring down soaring prices but acknowledge how it could weigh on corporate profits and consumer spending, two vital engines for economic expansion.

Coca-Cola (KO) dropped 4% while McDonald's Corp (MCD) slipped by nearly the same margin as investors focused inwards to household expenses amid inflation worries yesterday morning at New York City exchange; however, Dow futures shed only about half a percentage point from last night’s close after opening sharply lower.

"Consumers are feeling pinched," said Sharon Womack-Meyer who manages the investments of middle-class families in Los Angeles yesterday evening at Wall Street exchange as prices for food, fuel and housing continue to skyrocket nationwide since inflation began climbing last year. "It's hard when you have a family on two paychecks — one is barely making ends meet."

The Fed has raised its benchmark rate seven times this cycle but continues with an aggressive stance despite fear of sluggish growth and possible recession if inflation keeps soaring. The central bank meets in three weeks to decide when the final hike will come before it shifts gears next year towards cutting interest rates once more after a long period since 2018, according to forecasts by economists last week at UCLA and Michigan State universities yesterday afternoon as investors watched for hints from Fed Chair Jerome Powell.

Asked about the timing of rate cuts in late September during an interview on CNBC after meeting with colleagues across Europe yesterday morning, he replied: "Our mandate is to do whatever it takes to create price stability and maximum employment - if we achieve those goals that's a good thing for America."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.6% at 35,197 points yesterday afternoon while the S&P 500 dropped by similar measure after closing near record high levels last week; futures have since moved in both directions as markets digest Fed decisions and other global events including a war between Ukraine and Russia that has disrupted commodity flows
