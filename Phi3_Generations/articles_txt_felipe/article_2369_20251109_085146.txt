In a recent development in Gaza City on March 15th, tensions flared again when protesters marched towards Israel's border fence for hours under scorching sunlight without any violent confrontations reported by Israeli authorities or international observers present at the time. A small team from UN human rights investigators was part of a delegation that included representatives from various Palestinian and regional organizations, along with several foreign journalists covering an array of issues related to Middle East conflicts for their respective media outlets across Europe, Asia, North America, and Australia-Pacific.

This latest march has been organized by the Gaza Strip's Popular Resistance Committees (PRC), which claims that Palestinians in Gaza have had enough of living under Israel’in blockade imposed over two decades ago after Hamas seized control during an uprising known as "Intifada." Despite several rounds of violence, including Israeli airstrikes and rocket fire from the Strip towards Tel Aviv's coastal regions, both countries have agreed to return to semi-normal conditions along their shared border since 2018.

Gaza’s residents fear that if they don't raise attention now while international focus remains divided between conflicts across various Middle Eastern nations like Syria and Yemen as well as the ongoing Israeli–Palestinian dispute, it might become even more difficult to break out of their impoverished enclave.

"We cannot let this momentum fizzle," said Amir Abbas from Gaza City's PRC leader Mahmoud Al-Zahawi during an interview with BBC Arabic last Friday evening prior to the march, where over 10,000 people gathered in a central location of Dura al-Balad neighborhood before dispersing towards the Israeli side. "We want our freedom and we're willing to fight for it."

Although both Israelis and Palestinians remain deeply rooted on this land with histories that intertwine over generations, Hamas continues asserting a political Islamic ideology where armed resistance is justified by self-defense against the perceived oppression of Palestinian Arabs under Israeli rule.

International organizations and observers condemn these acts while emphasizing dialogue between parties to find peaceful solutions within their territories, despite decades without a successful agreement leading towards normalcy in relations for nearly 20 years with each blaming the other's actions during outbreak of violence as well. The UN Secretary-General António Guterres has repeatedly called on both sides not to undermine progress made since Camp David Summit and emphasized that "dialogue remains key" but his efforts have so far met limited success, leaving many experts skeptical about achieving lasting peace in this region.

In the words of UN human rights investigator Anna Monea, who accompanied reporters on a journey to understand Palestinian perspectives and lived experiences under Israeli-imposed conditions: "The situation here is desperate for many families struggling daily with unemployment rates nearing 50%, limited access to clean water resources causing numerous health crises while living in fear of possible military actions by Israel."

Amidst concerns that escalating protests could result in another cycle of violence as seen previously, international aid organizations like Oxfam have warned against potential economic and social devastation within Gaza's densely populated strip
