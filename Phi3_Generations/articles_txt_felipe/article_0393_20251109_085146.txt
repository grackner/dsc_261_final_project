A powerful storm swept through Oklahoma last night, causing significant damage and disruption as it moved across parts of Texas before intensifying over Kansas on Saturday evening into a strong tornado warning system covering multiple states including Missouri and Illinois by late afternoon Sunday. In its wake, the National Weather Service issued alerts for potential severe weather in Ohio with gusty wind speeds expected to reach upwards of 45 mph (72 km/h) on Monday morning before a chance at calm conditions returned mid-week due to high pressure systems moving in from Canada.

Witnesses reported seeing massive hailstones the size of baseballs, which broke windows and damaged roof shingles as they flew through parts of Oklahoma City around 2 AM today (Saturday). Authorities confirmed that at least three people had been injured but did not specify if these were related to any storm activity. The National Weather Service has issued a severe thunderstran alert for the area, advising residents and travelers alike to stay indoors until conditions improve later this afternoon (Saturday).

Experts say such intense weather patterns are becoming more common as global temperatures rise, with Kansas University Professor of Atmospheric Science Dr. James Smith stating that "we're seeing these extremes happen at a higher frequency than ever before." The Oklahoma Climatological Data Center reports an all-time record high for the state this month and believes it could impact future trends in local weather systems over time as well if climate change continues unabated.

"These events are not isolated anymore," commented meteorologist with NBC News Alex Chen, pointing out that similar storm patterns have been observed across multiple regions of the country within recent months leading into fall seasons typically known for calmer conditions and milder temperatures in many areas impacted by this severe weather event.

With millions still without power as they struggle to return home after days spent on couches, bedding or whichever safe shelter option was possible during last night's storm outbreak which resulted over 250 reported damages and injuries so far according the latest update by FEMA this morning (Saturday). The Kansas-Missouri corridor remains under active weather watch with continued hazards as wind gust speeds continue at times exceeding 60 mph while rain showers are expected to persist well into Sunday before settling down towards noon after some scattered thunderstorms hit parts of Missouri overnight today (Saturday).

"The community spirit here is incredible," remarked Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt in a statement issued by the Governor's Office yesterday evening during last night's weather advisory briefing when he visited areas heavily affected around town, specifically speaking to first responders currently assisting residents still stranded without homes or power supplies after days spent evacuating from floodwaters following heavy rainfall before tornadic wind conditions began picking up speed early Saturday morning.

Emergency management teams in both states are now shifting their focus towards recovery efforts as they try to assess the full extent of damages sustained throughout affected regions, while FEMA continues providing immediate aid and relief supplies for those most impacted by this ongoing disaster situation which started over a week ago when Hurricane Ida brought record rainfall across Texas before rapidly moving into Oklahoma City resulting in flash flooding that has since claimed countless damages including road closures, downed power lines causing widespread blackouts for millions and left many communities reeling
