In a major development in U.S.-China trade relations that has rattled global markets since early Monday morning, President Donald Trump's administration announced new tariffs on Chinese imports valued at $50 billion to retaliate against China’ extraterritorial practices alleged by the US Trade Representative (USTR). The 25% levy will come into effect immediately and has already prompted a downturn in major stock indexes worldwide.

"It's time for us, as consumers of their products who employ American workers, to stand up," President Trump said at the White House briefing on Monday morning. "We have been very patient with China over many years; now is not that time." The imposition marks an escalation from existing tariffs targeted primarily towards aluminum and steel exports coming into the U.S., which were introduced as part of a broader trade policy shift last year aiming to correct what it sees as unfair practices by China in global markets, such as forced technology transfers through non-standard contracts commonly known as 'dumping.'

"China has used their massive industrial might and market dominance for years now without proper recompense," said a senior administration official who requested anonymity. "The United States stands firm in protecting its interests, especially when it comes to ensuring fairness across the board." The move was met with stern responses from Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi during his recent trip to Beijing where he condemned what he called Trump's 'unilateral approach.'

The new tariffs come into effect immediately and will initially apply only to certain types of goods, including televisions, laptops, smartphones as well as various household items. The USTR said it would take steps against additional imports after reviewing the initial impact on global supply chains over 15 days following Monday's announcement.

"There is no doubt in my mind that these tariffs will cause immediate disruptions and uncertainty," economist Richard Roll from Stanford University told CNN Business. "Consumers are already starting to feel their pinch, which we might see amplifying as the policy unfolds." 

The White House has defended its approach by citing a $507 billion trade deficit with China for goods in those categories between October and February of this year alone. President Trump’s move follows months' worth of threats against imposing new tariffs on Chinese imports amid the U.S.-China dispute that has seen both countries engaging intensely over accusations of unfair trade practices, intellectual property stealing among other issues. The tit-for-tat approach was first applied to aluminum and steel products last year when then President Trump imposed a 25% tariff on those imports coming into the U.S., which China reciprocated with its own set of countermeasures targeting American agricultural exports, like soybeans among other goods.

"We believe these new measures will force Beijing to seriously reconsider their policies and negotiate in good faith," a senior Trump administration official said earlier this week while briefing reporters outside the Oval Office ahead of his trip on China where he had scheduled meetings with top Chinese leaders including President Xi Jinping.

Experts have expressed concerns that escalating tensions between two global superpowers will not only further damage worldwide economic growth but also set back decades worth of progress in opening up economies and liberalizing trade
