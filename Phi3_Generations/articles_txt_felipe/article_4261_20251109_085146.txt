CNN NEWS NETWORK – March 30, 2in New York City'S Chelsea neighborhood: A celebration of artistic expression as local artist community organizes annual "Voice Through Art" exhibition at the Grand Union Gallery this Saturday evening. The event promises to showcase a collection from more than fifty artists across various mediums and will be held in conjunction with several workshops for aspiring painters, sculptors, and photographers throughout the day on March 30th.

Local artist Jane Doe expressed excitement about this year's exhibition saying: "Art has always been our way to communicate complex feelings that words can’t capture – I believe ‘Voice Through Art’ will be a powerful platform for us." Organizers anticipate the event attracting art enthusiasts and critics alike, aimed at providing artists with an opportunity to showcase their work while engaging directly with audiences.

This year's exhibition features pieces from emerging as well as seasoned creatives in New York City’s thriving arts scene that boasts a diverse array of styles and perspectives, ranging from contemporary painting and digital art to classic oil works on canvas alongside innovative mixed media installations. Participating artists will be selected based on their unique expressions through the use of texture, form, composition, symbolism, metaphorical content or abstract representation within various mediums including acrylic paints, pencils, ink and more unconventional materials like recycled objects to represent environmental themes.

Gallery director Susan Smith remarked: "We are thrilled about the broad range of artwork we have received for this year's exhibition – it really reflects New York City’s dynamic creative spirit." She also emphasized that many artists will be sharing stories behind their work and some pieces even allow audience interaction during gallery hours.

As part of promoting dialogue about the intersection between contemporary artistic expression and societal issues, 'Voice Through Art' has invited local activists to present alongside visual arts as well – providing a forum for community engagement at Grand Union Gallery on March 30th from 6pm until midnight.

Chloe Taylor, an aspiring mural artist who will display her latest work titled ‘The Urban Labyrinth,' said: "It's not just about creating visually stunning pieces but also telling a story of resilience and hope that resonates with my community.” She sees this as both a personal challenge in exploring complex narratives through artistic expression while connecting to broader urban life.

The event will kick off the evening after an 'Artists Prep' roundtable discussion held at Grand Union Gallery from 5:30pm-7pm on March 30th where professional artists share techniques, tips and tricks for creating impactful works of art while promoting creativity within themselves.

"I am delighted to see such an exciting lineup this year – I know that all the attendees will leave feeling inspired," said gallery curator Elizabeth Martinez during her opening remarks before starting a preview tour through some featured pieces including abstracts and realistic portraats alike. She added: “We want everyone to feel like they are part of something special.”

In an effort to continue promoting art education, the Grand Union Gallery is also collaborating with local schools for after-school workshops teaching basic painting skills through various techniques leading up until March 28th –
