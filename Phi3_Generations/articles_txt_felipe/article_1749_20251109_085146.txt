A recent study by a leading travel agency has revealed that Paris is now ranked as one of Europe's top five most charming and romantic destinations for couples planning their honeymoon or special celebration getaway, coming in just behind Venice and Barcelona. The comprehensive survey conducted this past January assessed various factors such as ambiance, cultural experiences available, dining options, ease of travel to the city from different parts of France, safety concerns regarding solo trips at nighttime, local customs that foster romance among couples, accommodation prices across different neighborhoods within Paris and accessibility for international visitors.
