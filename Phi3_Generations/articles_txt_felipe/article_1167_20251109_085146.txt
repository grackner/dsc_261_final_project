Downtin' on Disney: Family-owned empire under pressure as streaming wars intensify | CNN Business News
The latest round of negotiations between The Walt Disney Company and its talented actors could signal a turning point in the entertainment industry, with major players scrambling to retain their stars. As Hollywood moves increasingly into the digital age, one thing is clear: for many performers at this powerhouse firm — from beloved Mickey Mouse figures to critically-acclaimed movie legends like Donald Duck and Merlin — there's no longer any room in Disneyland when it comes time to renegotiate contracts.

Disney has faced growing discontent among its stars who feel their pay is not commensurate with the streaming service revenues they helped generate, which have surged as subscribers flock for binge-worthy content on platforms like Disney+ and ESPN+. Industry insiders suggest that while negotiations remain in a delicate phase, actors are starting to hold more leverage than ever before — even without offering concessions of their own time or treasure.

As executives brace for potential showdown this fall at the annual meeting of shareholders on September 25, here are some insights into what could unfold as one-third of Hollywood talent takes aim at their own destiny in a new media age:

Disney+ Revenue Doubles Since Launch | Source: CNN Business News (Last accessed August 16th) - Disney announced that its streaming service reached nearly 90 million subscribers worldwide by the end of Q2, up from an estimated 45 million in January. The rapid growth is largely due to exclusive original content such as "The Mandalorian" and rebranded classics like remakes of beloved films including Disney's live-action adaptation of Tim Burton's dark fairy tale feature film, ''Midsommer Madness'' (a fictional title).

As one studio insider put it bluntly: "We are in a digital gold rush. Everyone wants access to these characters now that Disney+ has created its own empire — and everyone is jostling for position." 

Industry analysts predict that if the talks break down, some performers may
