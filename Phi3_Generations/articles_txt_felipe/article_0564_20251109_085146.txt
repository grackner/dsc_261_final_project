As a professional sports writer for CNN covering significant basketball events in real-time and with an emphasis on human interest stories offseason or past incidents alike, here's how I would craft the article:


In Los Angeles last Saturday night, what started as regular NBA playoff action quickly turned into one of the most harrowing moments for a local family. The Lakers vs. Clippers game was halted abruptly when an intense fight broke out in the stands between two fans wearing Boston Bruins jerseys during commercial breaks, leaving players and spectators shaken by what they witnessed just as their team scored on offense.


The altercation took place shortly after halftime around 9:30 PM local time at Staples Center in Los Angeles when fans from the opposing teams accidentally mixed up with each other amidst a sea of Boston Bruins jerseys, due to their presence following an impromptu road trip by players. The conflict erupted during Lakers' star player LeBron James hit his second 3-pointer just as two men wearing the red 'NHL' logo caps approached each other excitedly.


"I didn't expect to see Bruins fans so heated up about our game," said a surprised LeBron, later clarifying that both sides were genuinely enthusiastic supporters of their teams and intended no harm initially as they debated play-by-play stats shared by fellow fan James Brown from Boston. "It all started with laughs over the players' pregame banter."


Referee Steven Minn took decisive action, issuing a $10,000 fine to each of the involved fans after separating them in an attempt to deescalate the situation; yet tensions remained high. "It was unexpected and unfortunately disruptive," said Minnesota Police Captain Michael Richards on-site overseeing crowd control at the event which drew a capacity full house, including about 50 Bruins supporters from last season's championship run to Los Angeles in March for their All Star game celebration.


The local police have assured that both fans involved are taken into custody and will face disciplinary action per city ordinance on public safety at sporting events, emphasizing the need for respect among rival supporters regardless of team affiliations or geographical distance. This incident has sparked discussions around fan etiquette in packed arenas where passionate loyalties can sometimes lead to misunderstandings and unintended conflicts like this one did at Staples Center on Saturday night, reminding sports enthusiasts about the importance of sportsmanship beyond just their home court.
