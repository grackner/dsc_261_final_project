In a small town in Ohio, health officials have confirmed an outbreak of measles that began late last month when travelers from a country with high rates of the disease returned home to Springfield (population: approximately 164,000). As of this week, there has been one reported fatality and over thirty-five people are currently being treated for severe complications.

The Ohio Department of Health identified two primary cases among schoolchildren aged fourteen on both ends - youngest siblings to the same set of parents who had recently visited relatives in Nigeria where measles is endemic, officials say. 

Dr. Emily Thompson, Director of Public Health at Springfield's Central Hospital said that "this outbreak underscCTC1easly how contagious and dangerous this virus can be when basic preventative measures like vaccinations are neglected." Measles is highly infectious; one person with the disease could, on average, spread it to 90 others.

Witnesses recount seeing children coughing uncontrollably in school hallways and parents rushing their kids off for immunization shots at nearby clinics as soon as possible after news of measles' arrival hit the town last weekend. As a result, Springfield has seen an uptick in appointments with health care providers administering vaccines to combat further spread within families and close-knit communities alike - efforts being backed by local government campaigns emphasizing its importance through educational outreach programs throughout schools across the town.

The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has issued an advisory statement reminding parents that two doses of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine - commonly known as MMR - provide lifelong protection against these diseases with "virtually zero risk" according to their spokesperson. Dr Laura Jones from Cleveland Clinic says the best way forward is not just treatment but also education about preventive health measures like regular immunization updates based on current science and recommendations by leading medical organizations worldwide (such as WHO).

Health officials in Springfield are urging all residents who traveled internationally within the last three months - especially those with no history of vaccination or previous exposure to measles-prone areas like Asia, Africa and Europe –to visit their doctor immediately for testing before attending public events.

Clinics have been setting up pop-up immunization centers across various parts in town due to overwhelming demand since the news broke out earlier this week; however they warn that it could take several weeks more before all suspected cases are identified and tested as symptoms sometimes manifest late onset after exposure. 

Local business owners have also rallied together, with Springfield's Chamber of Commerce offering free childcare for parents at these centers while schools remain closed; many children will likely be sent home early this Friday (April 17th) to further mitigate contagion risks before widespread testing begins next week.

"We need everyone's support in getting through this difficult time," says Mayor James Smith who has been closely monitoring the situation and coordinating with federal health agencies working directly on containment strategies within Ohio, as well across state lines due to potential spreading concerns arising from travelers returning home during holidays amidst increasing number of cases outside U.S borders (in
