In an unexpected turn of events yesterday evening at Old Trafford, Manchester United's new striker Carlos Gomez unveiled his skills to a raucous home crowd during their match against Arsenal in the English Premier League (EPL). Known for playing as right-back on loan from Atletico Madrid since September 2019 but recently promoted due to injuries at Aston Villa, Gomez took charge of the attacking midfield.

"He's not your typical defender," remarked an awe-struck spectator who watched closely as Carlos weaved through players and set up two goals in just 20 minutes – one of which came from his first touch after receiving possession centrally, putting Manchester United firmly ahead for good.

Gomez'selfarmed to make the change with manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer noting that "Carlos has been impressive on both ends so far and I believe he could become a key player in our squad." Since joining at Aston Villa from Atletico Madrid, Carlos had consistently impressed with his tenacity defensively but struggled to replicate those results offensively.

Manchester United's head coach Ole Gunnar Solskjaer made the decision after reviewing promising performances of their young players during a recent training camp in Spain – particularly highlighted by Carlos who has shown promise with his dribbling skills and passing accuracy on the pitch, despite not having played much attacking football prior to this season.

The 26-year-old Colombian is expected back at Aston Villa next summer where he can continue honing these talents in preparation for a transfer that has been widely anticipated since his stellar showing against Arsenal yesterday evening; reports have speculated offers from several top European clubs, with Real Madrid and Barcelona rumored to be interested.

As Carlos continues this impressive form into the new season, one thing is certain: Manchester United supporters will no doubt expect nothing less than outstanding performances whenever he wears their colors - or any team's for that matter!
