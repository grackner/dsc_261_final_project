Topic: Style - Beauty

In a bold move towards redefining beauty standards within fashion circles, New York City's latest runway show featured models with naturally tanned skin and diverse body types strutting down the catwalk in July of this year. This groundbreener approach to style made waves across social media platforms as brands that historically shunned non-white participants embraced a broader definition of beauty, sparking conversations about representation within fashion industries nationwide.


"The runway has always been an opportunity for artistic expression and it's high time we reflect the true diversity in our city," stated Alex Taylor, one designer leading this charge on style evolution at New York Fashion Week. The show saw a lineup of 15 models representing different ethnicities with varying body shapes challenge preconceived notions about who should be considered fashionable and desirable as role models within the industry's sphere.


Critics hail this shift towards inclusivity, arguing that it is long overdue for a field rife with criticism of its lacking representation in terms of race and body types — an issue which has been brought into sharp focus by social media activism calling out various brands on these very grounds. A representative from the model agency behind some of this season's shows said, "We understand that fashion should be for everyone to enjoy – it needs to represent all people in society."


Social influencers and industry veterans have also voiced their support for what many are calling a significant cultural milestone within style. Celebrity makeup artist Jenna Smith commented, “For too long the beauty standards dictated by fashion media were exclusionary. I’m thrilled to see more inclusivity in this year's shows and can genuinely say that every day my clients now feel like they are a part of something revolutionary.”


Looking towards future events, brands have pledged continued commitment on their websites promising increased diversity across all aspects. Industry watchers speculate more runway shows nationwide may follow suit as the conversation expands beyond fashion into wider societal issues about race and beauty standards — a development that many hope will lead to lasting change within cultural perceptions of style over time.
