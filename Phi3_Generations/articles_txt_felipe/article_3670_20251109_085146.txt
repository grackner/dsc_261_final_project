In a stunning medical development from Boston University School of Medicine last month, researchers have successfully treated an unrelated genetic disorder in three patients using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology for the first time ever outside clinical trials. The team used this technique to correct mutations causing rare inherited diseases known as Mucopolysaccharidosis Type VII (MPS7) and Duchenne Muscular Dystrode (DMD), typically left untreatable until now.

This revolutionary advancement could change the way we perceive genetic disorders' management worldwide, offering hope to thousands of patients with these devastating conditions yearly in the United States alone — approximately 150 people diagnosed annually as per data from Muscular Dystrophy Association. The treatment was carried out at Boston University School of Medicine and involved editing specific genes within a patient's own cells, which were then re-introduced to correct these mutations directly in the affected tissues — avoiding potential side effects or complications that come with other treatments like enzyme replacement therapy.

"We have been working on this technique for years and seeing it work outside a trial environment is truly exceptional," said Dr. Elizabeth Turner, lead researcher at Boston University School of Medicine in the study published last month which details these procedures' successful results over multiple months post-treatment with no reported adverse effects so far - something that has been worryingly common amongst earlier experimental treatments for rare genetic disorders involving stem cell transplants or enzyme replacement therapy.

Several patients treated were siblings who, prior to the procedure and their parents' initial relief quickly turned into a sense of hope at what this new treatment could mean for future generations afflicted by these diseases. "It has been like looking through a window that I thought would never open," said Michael Johnson (pseudonym), father of one of the three patients who underwent the procedure, expressing gratitude not just towards his children's medical team but also hope for potential advancements in gene therapy around him.

Although initial costs associated with this cutting-edge treatment are steep — as high as $1 million per patient based on estimates from Genetic Medicine Inc., which is developing a more accessible and affordable version, genetic disorders' management worldwide could see significant improvements following the successful application of gene editing in clinical conditions.

As for next steps forward - Dr. Turner emphasized that "this marks just one step towards broader applications; we need to conduct further studies before this technique becomes a routine part of healthcare." Nevertheless, it's evident from these first leaps taken by scientists and medical professionals worldwide using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology for curing genetic disorders that the door is now open on what could potentially be an era where no form of inherited disease will remain untreatable. With rigorous scientific scrutiny, these initial findings can pave way towards a future free from certain types of hereditary diseases – something once thought to belong only in science fiction novels and movies.

This groundbreaking development sends waves across the global medical fraternity — one hopes that this marks an era where patients previously seen as untreatable find solace at last, with scientists worldwide now working diligently towards refining these techniques further to bring hope for millions of people currently suffering from debilitating genetic disorders.
