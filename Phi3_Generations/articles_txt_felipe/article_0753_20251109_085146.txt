A local fitness trainer has been hospitalized with a severe case of exercise-induced asthma on Wednesday morning in San Diego County. Alex Morgan, who started the training session at La Jolla Beach and Tennis Club around sunrise today for an outdoor workout group consisting primarily of senior citizens aged 65 and above, experienced difficulty breathing midway through his routine which involved high-intensity interval exercises on sand dunes.

At approximately 7 a.m., witness Linda Taylor spotted Morgan struggling to catch his breath amidst the workout group; she immediately called for medical assistance when it became apparent that he wasn't recovering quickly enough after stopping exercise and using an inhaler, which had failed him twice this morning due to its decreased efficacy.

According to Dr. Henry Clarkson of San Diego General Hospital Emergency Department who treated Morgan upon his arrival shortly afterwards around 7:30 a.m., “The patient’s history reveals that he has been suffering from mild exercise-induced asthma for the past five years, but today's episode appears to be unusually severe and possibly triggered by an increase in activity level coupled with outdoor environmental factors such as dust or pollen. We will run a full set of pulmonary function tests and consult his regular physician to review any recent changes before he is discharged.”

“I've been training here for years, but today I thought my body just needed some extra motivation,” Morgan told reporters after regaining consciousness in the hospital. “It wasn’t until halfway through our routine that a sudden and intense shortage of breath set off alarms not only to myself or anyone else around me.”

Experts say people with asthma should always consult their doctors before starting any new exercise routines, particularly high-intensity exercises like the one Morgan was doing today. “It's crucial that individuals with a respiratory condition such as asthma get clearance and appropriate management plan from their physician prior to commencing vigorous physical activities,” said Dr. Clarkson, adding it is essential for them always have access to rescue medication while exercising outdoors in case of an episode.

The San Diego County Public Health Department issued a statement reminding seniors that participating in senior fitness programs requires careful planning and communication with trainers who can help identify personal limits, risks factors or pre-existing conditions like asthma which could be exacerbated by strenuous activities. “We urge the public to take note of these guidelines as we continue working closely together in fostering a safe environment for everyone,” said Dr. Jane Simmons from San Diego County Health, emphasizing that health and safety should always come first over maintaining routine or meeting goals.

Follow-safety protocol when participating in senior fitness programs by ensuring personal medical conditions such as asthma are under control through a proper management plan developed with doctors’ guidance before embarking on strenuous activities that can increase risks to seniors' respiratory health. Experts say this will help avoid unnecessary exposure and potential accidents like Morgan endured today which is not only damaging but also humbling for him as a seasoned fitness trainer in the community with 25 years of experience; he has been advocating on numerous occasions about being conscious towards one’s body limitations.
