In a stunning turn of events in Melbourne this weekend, an earthquake with preliminary magnitudes reaching up to 5.4 shook homes and businesses across Victoria at approximately 3:17 PM local time on Saturday, July 19th, according to the Australian Geological Survey Organization (AGSO). The quake struck just north of Melbourne International Airport near Laverton before fading away after about two minutes. No tsunami warnings were issued as a result, and no severe damage or fatalities have been reported so far; however, residents in areas such as Malvern East experienced mild shaking during the incident.


Geologists from AGSO are currently analyzing seismic data to pinpoint precise details about this unexpected tremor'th location and magnitude. "It is quite unusual for Melbourne," said Dr. Lydia Bennett, a leading geologist involved in the investigation. She mentioned that such an event could potentially happen every few years but usually stays under Magnitude 4 on Richter scale due to Australia’s tectonic activity pattern of spreading and subduction zones being far from Victoria's eastern coastline.


A spokesperson for Emergency Management Victoria commented, "We have dispatched rescue crews throughout the area as a precautionary measure even though there are no immediate injuries or reports." The local government is coordinating with civil defense agencies to monitor any aftershocks and ensure that emergency services remain on high alert.


Residents of Melbourne International Airport's surrounding areas reported feeling light shaking, especially in the suburb of Malvern East but also felt by parts extending as far west as Caulfield Grammar School. Many took to social media sharing their experiences: "It was like an old creaky house on stilts starting to sway," wrote a witness from Caulfield North; while another described, “The ground just rumbled under my feet for nearly two minutes.”


Experts advise that all affected areas remain vigilant as more information becomes available and emphasize the importance of being prepared at any time. Residents are encouraged to review their earthquake emergency kits and have an evacuation plan ready if required by local officials in future seismic events.


Reactions from Melbourne locals range from surprise to relief, with many expressing gratitude that the quake caused no harm or significant property damage; some business owners even reported a temporary halt allowing for safety checks on their premises: “We are just thankful it was nothing major,” shared one cafe owner in Laverton. 


Authorities assure all residents to stay updated with local news and emergency services, urging everyone not to panic but maintain calm until the seismologists provide a comprehensive understanding of this unforeseen tremor's impact on Victoria’s infrastructure and populace health well-being.
