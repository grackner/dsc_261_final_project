A luxury hotel in Las Vegas has announced an unexpected closure of its premises due to severe maintenance issues that were discovered last night as guests prepared for a grand party scheduled this weekend. The opulent Stardust Resort, known for their extravagant events and famous casino floor dating back decades ago when it first opened in 1971 by Howard Hughes, is now closed until further notice after safety concerns could no longer be ignored following the inspection of its structural integrity.

The news comes as a shock to thousands of visitors who have been flocking into Nevada for months due to events and conventions lined up in Sin City since last year's influx that marked an all-time high, according to Clark County Tourism Division data from December 2022. The annual attendance has now hit record numbers again this February with over a million tourists visiting the state of Nevada alone as reported by local law enforcement in Henderson and Las Vegas metropolitan areas since January’s festivities began, making it one of the busiest times for travelers to experience everything from music concerts to renowned sports competitions.

However, a sudden turnaround came when hotel staff found extensive signs of wear-and-tear on critical infrastructure such as balconies and stairwell handrails that put guests' lives at risk—a finding revealed during an emergency night inspection conducted by the establishment’s head maintenance supervisor. The immediate aftermath prompted all bookings being held in its luxurious suites, deluxe rooms, exclusive lounges, and VIP guest houses to be abruptly cancelled within a few hours of discovery without prior notice given out or refund offered; no cause for the inconvenience was disclosed at this point.

“We apologize deeply from our hearts but we cannot allow guests into dangerously flawed surreneral living quarters,” said hotel director, Marilyn Rigby in a press conference yesterday afternoon held outside of its main entrance where thousands had gathered for the highly anticipated party scheduled on Saturday night; her words did little to assuage concerns among those present.

The closure came after hours-long discussions between representatives from Clark County Management Agency and hotel officials attempting resolving safety issues before this weekend's events kicked off with live music performances by top names like Keith Urban or Lady Gaga—none of which could take place due to unforeseen circumstances. The resort had also planned outdoor activities on Sunday where guests would get immersed in entertainment provided under the warm Las Vegas sun, including horse riding experiences and guided city tours by knowledgeable locals for history lovers as per their brochure promises; both plans now stand halt following yesterday’s developments.

"We never imagined anything like this happening at our beloved establishment," said a guest who arrived early Thursday, eagerly anticipating her long-awaited stay but was left disappointed after being informed by an employee on check-in; she expressed frustration as no alternative accommodation had been provided nor refund given. "It just feels like this is all for show and they didn't take our safety seriously enough," the guest lamented while scrolling through social media, sharing her dismay with others who also voiced their thoughts in similar tones online; one commenter wrote: “I guess Vegas can be dangerous sometimes too.”

The closure has left many asking questions about how such a pr
