During a weekend of record-breaking temperatures in Death Valley National Park, California, an unprecedented hotel stay was turned into survival mission for two stranded tourists who got lost near Furnace Wash Trailhead on Saturday afternoon and only made it back to their Los Angeles rental late Sunday evening.

Lifeguard John Miller recounts finding the pair, disoriented from dehydration: "The heat was unbearable," he says with a sigh of relief that they had returned safe by 7pm on Sunday night after nearly two days lost in what local tourism officials have dubbed as 'the worst camping experience ever.'

"I remember the day started out sunny, but we made sure to keep ourselves hydrled and applied sunscreen every time I checked back up with them," Miller continues. The National Park Service issued a heat advisory that same weekend due to forecasted temperatures exceeding 120°F (49°C) throughout the park – Death Valley's temperature is notoriously hot, but never before has it crossed this level of danger for tourists without proper preparation.

The couple were originally part of a larger group planning on hiking along Furnace Wash Trailhead and staying overnight at The Hotel Caltex Visalia 50 miles away from the national park's northern border with Nevada when they found themselves unsure which direction to head in after their planned trail split into two paths. After hours of searching, it became apparent that one path was leading deeper into Death Valley National Park while taking them further away from civilization; meandehydration and heat exhaustion set in quickly as temperatures continued soaring above 105°F (41°C).

"The sun felt like a burning ball on my back," recalls Sarah Thompson, one of the tourists. "At some point we thought about giving up but I don't know if it was pure will or desperation to stay alive." 

With no cell reception and limited water supply from their packs that had run dry after two days hiking back toward civilization along rugged terrain, they sought out help at the nearest campsite on Sunday. According to Miller's testimony - he saw them around dusk as "lost tourists" while patrolling – it was not until a Los Angeles lifeguard found and rescued the stranded couple that their ordeal came to an end, ending with several hours of treatment at The Hotel Caltex Visalia.

The National Park Service issued a statement on Monday warning travelers planning trips into Death Valley over Labor Day weekend: "Traveling in this national treasure requires respect for the environment and preparedness." They emphasized proper hydration, sunscreen use, wearing light-colored clothing to reflect heat back away from skin, checking conditions beforehand by calling 725-2541 (Death Valley Visitor Center) or emailing nps.deathvalley@nps.gov and following marked trails while hiking at Death Valley National Park: "The only true way to experience this national park safely is on a well planned guided tour."

After her story went viral, Sarah Thompson has urged fellow travelers planning trips into the American Southwest not just prepare physically but also educate themselves about local weather and terrain conditions before setting out: "It's important to take these
