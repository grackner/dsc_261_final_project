In an unprecedented move in Hollywood, director Ava DuVernay has been appointed as Chairperson for a new independent film production company aimed at empowering underrepresented voices within the industry. The announcement was made yesterday by CEO of Universal Pictures, Jean Mische during their annual meeting which took place on Monday evening in Los Angeles.

Mische stated that this appointment signifies DuVernay's commitment to diversifying content and enseneric representation behind-the-scenes as well as at the forefront through her films like "Selma." As part of Universal Pictures, she will oversee all aspects of film production with a keen eye on amplifying diverse perspectives.

"Ava is not just our Chairperson but an inspiration for many within and beyond the industry," said Mische. DuVernay responded saying that "her heart lies in telling stories about marginalized communities because they often don't have a platform." 

Moshe Schwartz, President of Paramount Pictures commented on Ava's influence stating that her leadership style and vision can only bring more inclusivity to the industry. He added he looks forward "to seeing how she impacts our company in these ways".  

The new initiative also comes at a time when studios across Hollywood are feeling increasing pressure from audiences for better representation on screen, as well as within their leadership ranks and creative teams. The move by DuVernay is expected to further cement this trend toward diversity in the entertainment industry moving forward into 2023.
