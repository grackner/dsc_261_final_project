In a stunning upset on Thursday night at Madison Square Garden, an underdog college basketball team led by freshman sensation Jordan McKay toppled their Ivy League rivals in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. This victory marked only the second time since conference play began that Harvard has not advanced beyond this stage.

Billed as a long shot for months due to an unbalanced roster and lackluster performances, Clemson University's team pulled off one helluva upset on Thursday night in New York City when they faced the defending national champions Yale at Madison Square Garden. With just over eight minutes left before halftime, it looked like all hope was lost for this small college with a storied past until McKay made an unbelievable run down court and scored from outside-in on one of his fellow freshman players, Ethan Harper.

McKay's heroics set off a series of events that ultimately led to Yale falling short by just five points in this first round matchup - 74–69 for Clemson University. This shocking win has been dubbed "The McKay Miracle" and it seems like the underdogs will continue their strong performance throughout Round Two at Madison Square Garden on Sunday night, according to NCAA statistics released Friday morning by league officials here in New York City where both teams hail from—Harvard University for Yale College.

In a statement provided afterward, McKay spoke about his victory and the team's overall improvement this season: "I couldn't have asked for more support from my teammates or better coaching than I received," he said with humility shining through even in defeat against top-ranked Duke later that day at Barclays Center.

Coach Rick Sutton, who has been working tirelessly to motivate his players this season after losing last year's championship game to Harvard itself by just one point and then suffering a significant recruiting setback when key freshman transfer player Malcolm Jones left for Boston University mid-season without telling him firsthand said: "We have come together as team, we were not the best physical specimens but our heart was strong," he explained. 

According to an official from Harvard College who declined comment due fear of political ramifications between rival schools - if one does become more successful than another academically or athletically it can lead universally tense relations, "we're proud of the hard work and determination Clemson University demonstrated tonight," he said.

Eddie Smith, a seasoned player from Duke who had been working with Harvard players for years before coming over here himself to play this year - also praised McKay but called his victory yesterday merely "fortunate luck." 

As the NCAA Tournament approaches its climax later this weekend when teams square off in Final Four games, it seems clear that Clemson University will not go quietly into defeat. Both players and officials acknowledge they have a long road ahead as Yale's loss opens up more opportunities for them on an even larger stage - the national championship game set to begin at Charlotte Coliseum Saturday night against Georgetown College of Washington D.C., just six hours away by car from New York City where these two teams call home, but this victory gives Clemson's fans something they never expected: hope that one day their team might even be able to beat Harvard University themselves - at Madison Square Garden next season and
