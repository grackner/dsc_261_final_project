A study reveals that couples who engage in regular physical activities together report higher relationship satisfaction levels and lower rates of separation or divorce compared to those leading sedentary lives apart from each other. The research conducted by the Institute for Social Research, based at XYZ University on August 15th analyzed data collected over a span of two years involving participants in various stages of their relationships across different cities like New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago.

Dr. Jane Doe, lead author of the study who specializes in marriage counseling psychology states that "participants engaging in joint activities had improved communication skills as well." Couples were encouraged to find common interests ranging from walking or biking together around parks and beaches to enrolling in fitness classes like dance, yoga, pilates or weightlifting.

Dr. John Smith of the same university shared an interesting insight: "Physical exercise releases endorphins which improve mood – a factor that can significantly enhance interpersonal connections." The findings also revealed those who worked out together reported stronger trust and emotional intimacy within their relationships compared to sedentary partners.

An anonymous respondent, Mary Johnson from Brooklyn said she started running with her partner on weekday mornings just before work began after months of struggling in the relationship due to financial issues that took a backseat as they bonded over achieving personal goals together. "Being outdorancing has given us something more than money to look forward to, our shared experiences," said Johnson with joy evident on her face and while sharing anecdotes about how each other's accomplishments had positively affected their relationship dynamic during these morning jogs in Brooklyn Park near the beach.

The study was supported by a grant provided for research into improving relationships among couples, funded partly by ABC Foundation which is dedicated to community engagement projects promoting healthy lifestyle choices within neighborhoods nationwide including New York City and Los Angeles where similar studies have already been conducted with successful results. Researchers are hopeful that these findings will encourage more initiatives focusing on incorporating physical activities into relationship building, as they believe this approach has the potential to reduce rates of divorce across many societies around the world while enhancing overall personal happiness and wellbeing among couples who make healthy lifestyle choices together.
