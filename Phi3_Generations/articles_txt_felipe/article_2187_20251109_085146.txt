As of Friday evening in Bangkok, Thailand's government is facing mounting criticism as it unveiled its controversial plans to expand Chatuchak Market into a sprawling mega-destination expected to draw millions during the upcoming summer months. The ambitious project would transform South Chiang Mai Road — an already busy thoroughfare bisected by Wat Samoran and Bua Suk Sutthasana temples, which serve as cultural landmarks of Bangkok's bustling Chinatown district — into a vibrant commercial hub featuring hotels, entertainment venues, retail shops, food stalls, parks, lakesides and more.

CNN reached out to government officials for comment but received no immediate response; however, one local business owner who wished not be named told us that while the plan is well-intentioned in aiming to boost tourism dollars during high season — typically July through August with peak arrivals between mid-July and early September — he fears it may overshadow unique attractions such as Chinatown's historic temples. "Chinatown has always been about tradition, culture," the business owner explained to CNN from his establishment near Wat Samoran temple where patrons have already noticed road closures being implemented in preparation for next month’s opening of a new boutique hotel on site along with multiple restaurants and entertainment outlets.

The city council approved plans back in February that would see more than 10,00degrees (a mix between parking spaces and event venues) spread across an area measuring around three football fields stretching from the temple to Bua Suk Sutthasana's main street. Tourism officials say traffic management has been a major concern as they plan how to accommodate millions of visitors during peak season, which is expected to see arrival rates rise by up to 15% in comparison with last year’s summer months according to Thailand’s Department of Tourism forecasting data published on Tuesday.

CNN also spoke briefly with Chinatown resident Mrs. Chan who expressed reservations about the new developments, telling us that though she appreciates efforts made by officials in expanding tourist offerings and infrastructure improvements within her neighborhood — including enhanced WiFi access throughout temples — "I hope they consider preserving some parts of what makes Chinatown special; it shouldn't lose its charm completely."

With opening day fast approaching next month, the city council has issued statements reassuring residents and business owners alike that construction will not obstruct worship services taking place within temples or disrupt daily operations around Wat Samoran temple while also promising to minimize noise during peak shopping hours. Traffic management officials have assured locals of a "flawless" plan aimed at ensuring smooth commute times for residents and visitors alike, despite concerns being raised by some about increased congestion from the new attractions popping up along South Chiang Mai Road this summer season which are expected to draw 1.2 million people annually between January through November with around half arriving during high season alone according to figures provided in a government tourism promotion video released last month that featured footage of crowded sidewalks, lively bars and bustling markets among local residents going about their daily lives.

One city council official told CNN the project has undergone years' worth of planning with extensive public input since it was first
