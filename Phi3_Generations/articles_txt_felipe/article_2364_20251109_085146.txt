A rare celestial event is expected to take place in early April when Comet NEOWISE becomes visible with the naked eye from Earth for the first time since ancient times... A team of scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) based near Los Angeles, California have been closely monitoring and studying this intriguing comet that will make its closest approach to our planet on April 29.

The Comet NEOWISE has captivated the attention of skywatchers across North America as it approaches Earth's orbit... It was first spotted by NASA astronomer Robert Hurt via data from their powerful Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) telescope on a routine survey. After confirming its identity and trajectory, scientists announced the comet’s approach to us earlier this month with much excitement surrounding the cosmic visitor...

"Comets like NEOWISE are incredibly valuable for science," says Dr. Sarah Meadows, an astrophysicist at JPL who has been studying Comet NEOWISE extensively since its discovery two years ago as it was first observed by WISE passing through our solar system... The comet's nucleus is a snowball of frozen gases, rock and dust left over from the formation of sun 4.6 billion years ago... When heated by the Sun to millions of degrees, they spew an assortment of water vapor (ice), carbon dioxide gas, methane gas, ammonia ice, along with some silicates -- sand and dirt particles – all forming a bright coma around its nucleus...

The Comet NEOWISE is expected to reach perihelion — or the closest point of Earth's orbit at 12:30 PM EDT on April 29, when it will be located approximately three times farther from us than our moon... As an object passes through space this close to us without colliding with any planets and other celestial objects -- which is nearly impossible given the vastness of our solar system – we must take every precaution," says Dr. Emily Roberts, chief scientist at JPL's Comet Observations team...

While experts have assured that there will be no harm to Earth due to passing comets like NEOWISE for many years and even centuries into the future as they travel on their elliptical orbits around our sun. "The distances involved in space mean impact events are highly unlikely," assures Roberts...

Comet watchers can take note of when Comet NEOWYSE will reach its peak brightness, which is expected to occur during early evenings this month with perfect conditions for clear skies and low light pollution. "To catch a glimpse of it requires patience," says amateur astronomer Peter Kline from Colorado who has already traveled more than 50 miles inland towards the darkest, most pristine skies...

While Comet NEOWYSE will be visible for just two weeks before and after its perihelion passage through Earth's neighborhood. Scientists are urging people to not lose sight of this rare opportunity as it passes by our planet at speeds up to 140,000 miles per hour...

"The Comet NEOWYSE is a unique chance for everyone -- both professionals and amateurs alike –to witness an incredible journey through space," says Roberts. "It'
