In an escalating series of tensions along their shared border in the South China Sea, military ships from both sides have exchanged gunfire this afternoon near disputed waters between mainland Asia and its surrounding nations as per eyewitness accounts on March 15th. The skirmish began when naval vessels identified with North Korea reportedly crossed into territorial seas claimed by multiple Southeast Asian countries, including the Philippines and Vietnam.

"As of now, no lives have been lost," a spokesperson for South Korean Defense Ministry said in an official statement today (March 15th). "However, we urge both sides to deescalate immediately."
