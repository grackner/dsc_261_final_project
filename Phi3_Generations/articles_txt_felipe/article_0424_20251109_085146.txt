In a move that caught international attention on Thursday, Egypt's military stepped in to stabilize protesters who have been clashing with security forces for weeks over fuel price increases and political dissent. The latest violence erupted just outside Cairo last weekend as crowds marched towards the capital demanding reform from President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi's government, which has faced mounting criticism both domestically and abroad since coming to power in 2curious about this event? Who are the main parties involved here? What exactly happened during these protests leading up to military intervention?

An estimated tens of thousands took part in peaceful demonstrations across Egypt over recent days, calling for an end to perceived corruption and democratic reforms. But growing unrest quickly turned violent after security forces dispersed a sit-in near the presidential palace last Saturday when protesters sought higher wages amid soaring inflation rates that have taken hold in Arab states since 2015's slump in global oil prices – prompting many ordinary Egyptians to worry about their financial futures.

On Tuesday night, things took a turn for the worse after dozens of protesters were shot at by plainclothes thugs near Sinai Peninsula resort town Sharm el-Sheikh as security forces tightened restrictions on public gatherings in coastal cities across Egypt amid rising tensions over economic hardship and political repression. Witnesses say the confrontation started when riot police stormed through downtown streets to disperse a peaceful protest, which was allegedly being staged by about 150 people demanding more affordable housing options due to skyrocketing property prices caused partly by tourism revenues flowing into Mideast nations post-2011 Arab uprisings.

Security forces fired tear gas and rubber bullets indiscriminately at protesters as well as journalists covering the event, according to eyewitness accounts circulated online since Wednesday night's clashes between demonstrators from lower-income neighborhoods of Cairo like Abbasiya district — which saw recent evictions on apartment buildings owned by relatives or business associates with government ties – and police allied thugs who targeted unarmed black youth.

"The authorities need to stop treating the Egyptian people as if they were nothing but tools for their political agenda," said 27-year-old Mohamed, an electrician in Abbasiya whose father lost his job last year when a gas turbine factory moved out of town after several years with close links between Sisi's regime and industry leaders.

"The army should step down from policing the country unless they genuinely aim to protect people." 

Egyptian authorities have maintained their narrative that protesters are nothing more than "terrorists in disguise," a claim echoed by Sisi himself during an annual televised speech on Friday night. In it, he accused opponents of foreign meddling and called for unity between the military government and police to end violence caused allegedly primarily due to extremist groups masquerading as activists or supporters seeking democratic change – a tactic some experts believe is aimed at justifying actions taken by security forces against protesters.
