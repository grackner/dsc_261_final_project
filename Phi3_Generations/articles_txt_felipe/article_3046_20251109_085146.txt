A rare albino deer was spotted wandering near Lakeview Park in Boulder on Saturday afternoon. The unique white-tailed doe managed to elude local hunters and wildlife officials for hours, prompting widespread attention from nature enthusiasttons across the state. Wildlife experts believe that this is an extraordinary sight given the typically reclusive behavior of albinos in Colorado's mountainous regions due to their distinct coloration making them more visible predators such as coyotes and hawks tend to avoid these creatures at all costs for survival reasons, leaving most found isolated or deceased from natural causes.

Albino deer are an extremely rare occurrence in the wild but can sometimes be seen wandering into urban areas looking for food during lean times like autumn when their primary diet of acorns becomes scarce leading to more human-deer interactions, which has been ongoing since October 1st. On this particular day around noon while residents were enjoying the last days of summer sunshine and picnicking in Lakeview Park near Boulder Creek Road at Eldorado Canyon Nature Center that is home to diverse wildlife populations ranging from elks to golden eagles, one such albino deer had already caught people's attention.

“It’s a pretty rare sight here on the Front Range where white-tailed does are seldom found,” stated Dr. Amy Hartley with Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW). “Its presence in our midst brings us all together to appreciate something truly special.” She continued, explaining that albinos typically have vision problems which make it difficult for them navigate back into the wilderness as quickly after they leave human contact areas like Lakeview Park. 

The albino deer drew crowds of onlookers including young families and photographers eager to get a glimpse while posing questions about its wellbeing without disturbing or harming it - which has become increasingly difficult considering how close this animal came into contact with people, something Dr. Hartley advised against due to the potential stress-related dangers for both humans as albinos are more vulnerable when scared; “We always advocate maintaining a safe distance and refrain from feeding wildlife,” she said before adding that CPSW had already been alerted about possible concerns regarding this specific animal’s safety.

The CPW team was dispatched late in the afternoon after reports of people attempting to approach or capture the deer for photos started circulating on social media platforms like Nextdoor, which brought local officials together with community members at Lakeview Park under one roof as they discussed ways forward regarding handling this unique situation involving a rare albino creature. CPW biologists have been closely monitoring its movements over recent days using trail cameras placed near the park’s perimeter since it first surfaced here back in October 1st while trying to assess if any lasting damage might be caused by human contact as albinos typically don't fare well after being found and handled due mostly to stress-related health problems.

Late yesterday evening, the CPW team reported they observed some signs of weight loss which was concerning for an animal that’s normally quite robust; however officials were relieved when it successfully made its way back into natural areas near Boulder with no apparent harm during overnight hours while still maintaining a safe distance from people and vehicles passing through Eldorado Canyon Nature Center.
