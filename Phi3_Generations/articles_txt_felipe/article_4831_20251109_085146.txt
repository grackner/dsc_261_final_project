A massive wildfire raged across New South Wales in Australia on Monday night when strong winds fanned flames towards populated areas near Sydney and its surrennial city of Wollongong to the northwest. The blaze, which started as a prescribed burn gone wrong last month, quickly became one of the country's deadliest bushfries ever recorded with at least 12 fatalities reported by firefighters fighting alongside residents in some local communities and an evacuation order for over 70,000 individuals.

Authorities have warned that conditions are likely to deteriorate further as the heat continues across much of southeastern Australia on Tuesday with temperatures expected around 40°C (104°F), humidity dropping close to zero and wind gusting up to over 95 km/h, according to meteorological data.

"This is one of the most significant events in modern Australian history," said Dr. Angela Martinson, a bushfire expert at Griffith University who has been monitoring the situation closely with colleagues across multiple fire-prone states and territories including Queensland and Tasmania through their Bushfire Analysis & Research Group (BARG). "These wildfires have devastated lives along Australia's east coast. We are now seeing similar conditions in other areas, which makes it critical for all Australians to stay vigilant."

Emergency services continue to battle the raging inferno while hundreds of aircraft and thousands more firefighters were mobilized nationwide including from New Zealand where Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern extended her heartfelt sympathies as well as an offer on behalf of all Kiwis "to help in any way we can, whether it's providing resources or expertise."

The NSW Rural Fire Service (RFS) issued its third ever extreme fire weather alert for the state and with gusty winds spreading fires further down south towards Port Stephens National Park near Newcastle where over 350 properties remain under threat as well. The Victorian government declared a state of disaster in regional Victoria on Monday night, including parts of Gippsland northwest of Melbourne after several localized bushfires began to threaten communities there following torrential rains that battered the region earlier this week and flooded roads leading into key areas like Bairnsdale.

In Wollongong alone where at least two suburbs remain under mandatory evacuation orders for thousands of people, Premier Gladys Berejiklian called it "the most serious bushfire emergency in Australia's history." She warned that the situation could get much worse before a change in weather brought relief by early next week after which residents and property owners were encouraged to prepare now ahead of potential damage caused as flames continued to spread, destroying homes with little warning.

"I can only imagine how terrifying it must be for those affected," Berejiklian said at a press conference in Sydney on Monday evening alongside NSW RFS Chief Firefighter Shane Downie who described the conditions facing his brigade as "some of our worst experiences." He noted that fire seasons have become longer and more intense each year due to climate change, but he added:

"Our brave men and women here continue doing everything humanly possible - risking their lives every day in this hellish environment. We are all part of the same family dealing with these wildfires together."
