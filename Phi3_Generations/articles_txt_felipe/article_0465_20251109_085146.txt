In an unprecedented astronomical event observed last night by stargazers and scientists alike in Chile's Atacama Desert near Mount Llullaillaco volcano, a comet passed exceptionally close to Earth—approximately 70 million miles away. The European Space Agency (ESA) reported the rare celestial visitor as Comet NEOWISE on March 29th at around midnight local time with clarity so sharp it could easily be visible even from light-polluted cities under optimal conditions using a modest amateur telescope equipped for astrophotography.

"Through my eyepiece and camera, I captured the most vivid tail of any comet in years," exclaimed Dr. Elisa Martinez, an amateur astronomer participating in ESA's Comet Watch program at a designated observation point halfway between La Serena city to the west and Copiapo to the east about 120 miles away from Mount Llullaillaco volcano where weather conditions were optimal.

The comet, which was last seen by early astronomers in pre-scientific times around this time of year, has been named NEOWISE (Not Of Winter Ewe) for its bright white tail and proximity to Earth at the same season when ewes are typically lambing. Dr. Martinez shared that she noticed "an eerie sense of déjà vu as if I was experiencing this ancient phenomenon all over again, but now with modern tools."

The ESA's Cometography team quickly got in touch with NASA for a coordinated observation effort due to the exceptional nature of NEOWISE. Accordingly, they released official observations and analysis from their instruments aboard SOHO (Solar & Heliospheric Observatory), which monitored cosmic ray intensities during Comet NEOWISE's flyby—a measure that could inform future studies on how comets affect Earth’s space weather.

"As we witness this stunning celestial event, I find myself reflecting upon the transient yet eternal nature of our universe," said Dr. Johnathan Reed from ESA Cometography team during his interview today at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena where observations were carried out along with other worldwide partners like SpaceWatch.org and Minor Planet Center (MCP).

Reports indicate that the tail of NEOWISE has been extending up to 34 miles long, a staggering size for any comet's visible trails due largely to it possessing high concentrations of water ice on its surface combined with intense solar radiation as close sunrise approached. This was confirmed by Dr. Reed: "The combination makes an incredibly luminous and vivid tail that can stretch across the night sky for hours."

Scientists are eager to analyze any data obtained during this special encounter, hoping it could shed light on how comets contribute towards Earth's atmospheric chemistry changes throughout time—a phenomenon known as nucleation. "There is so much we don’t yet understand about our cosmic environment and events like Comet NEOWISE provide a pristine example of the wonders that await in exploring these unknown frontiers," added Dr. Reed at NASA JPL, where several telescopes were trained upon the comet as it made its journey around Earth's orbit.
