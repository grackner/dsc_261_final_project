A devastating tornado tore through a small Midwestern town in Indiana yesterday evening around 6 pm local time. The EF3 category storm unleashed wind speeds of up to 150 miles per hour, leaving behind a trail of destruction that experts describe as one of the worst they've seen this season.


A witness recounts seeing trees obliterated and homes completely demolished in their path: "I never thought I would see such devastation here," said long-time resident Mary Johnson, who managed to take cover just moments before a massive tree fell onto her home. 


Experts from the National Weather Service have arrived on site, noting that this extreme weather event is one of many they've witnessed intensify in recent years due to climate change: "These tornadoes are happening with greater frequency and intensity; it’increasingly clear how our changing environment contributes," stated meteorologist Dr. Edward Harris while surveying the aftermath at Southridge, Indiana (860 miles south of Chicago). 


Several emergency responders were among locals who helped to begin clean-up efforts before leaving for more severe storms forecasted this weekend: "It's a daunting task ahead. We need community support now," urged Fire Chief Robert Walton as he coordinated evacuation and rescue plans, noting that they have deployed around 50 personnel on the ground along with numerous vehicles to assist in relief efforts (97 responders).


As residents begin their own clean-up work later today after a brief period of respite amid cooler temperatures expected overnight into tomorrow evening, questions remain about how such powerful storms can occur more frequently: "I'm hoping we all learn from this and take climate change seriously," added Dr. Harris before departing for the next town in need as Indiana braces itself once again against an oncoming threat.
