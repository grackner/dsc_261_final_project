In a recent turn of events in East Africa's Horn region, Ethiopia reported on Thursday that one million individuals have been displaced following intensified conflicts between multiple ethnic groups within the country’in Tigray Region since November last year. The United Nations has declared this mass movement as 'one of humanitarian crisis proportions.'


"It's unthinkable to see families torn apart, with some relatives fleeing their homes without warning," said Alexis Mabunda, a UNHCR official in Addis Ababa who oversees the Tigray region. "The scale and suddenness of this displacement is deeply concerning."


Reports indicate that violence has escalated since December 2019 when tensions rose between Ethiopia's central government led by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and ethnic-based groups, notably the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which had previously held power in various parts of the country. The latest outbreak began with skirmishes near Mekelle, Ethiopia’s capital city that is more than 400 miles from Addis Ababa and far removed geographically as well politically to some communities within Tigray Region itself; it spread rapidly across a vast area of the country'


According to human rights organizations working in close contact with those affected, reports suggest at least two major instances where conflict has triggered mass evacuations. One was recorded on January 15th when hostilities forced families and individuals flee Tigray’s central Mekelle towards Sudanese border towns like Zalambessa; another disturbing case of displacement involved the township of Shire in November, with reports emerging that several thousand people were forcibly relocated to Addis Ababa'


"Thousands are not just fleeing across international borders – they’re leaving everything behind," said Emily Sato from Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders), who is currently working in the Tigray region. "Accessing medical care and aid for displaced populations here remains a significant challenge."


The Ethiopian government's response has been to close down its southern border with Sudan, citing security concerns amid fear of spillover effects from ongoing conflict within the country; while regional leaders have made pleas urging communities not to flee across porous borders. "We ask our citizens in Tigray and neighboring areas not to cross into Eritrea or Sudan without proper authorization," said TPLF commander Se'are Meles during a speech at his base of operations last weekend.


The international community has yet to respond with large-scale humanitarian aid packages, though the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) reported earlier this month that more than 475,000 individuals are internally displaced in Tigray alone; a number which could be much higher considering ongoing clashes between multiple sides. In its latest reports to Ethiopia’s government and donors worldwide for emergency relief funding appeals this month, the UNHCR has requested $35 million (£28 million) but so far only received pledges of half that amount by Wednesday afternoon; a fact not lost on regional authorities.


"We’re in desperate need right now – we don't know how much longer our people will be without food, clean water or shelter," TPLF spok
