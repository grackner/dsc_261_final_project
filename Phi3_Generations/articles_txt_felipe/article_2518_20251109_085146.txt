Buffalo Bills rookie running back Devin Singletary scored a touchdown to lead Buffalo in their Monday Night Football win over Cincinnati this past weekend at Highmark Stadium on October 29th, continuing the team's undefeated start. In his first career NFL game since being drafted from Miami (Ohio) last spring as part of a three-team trade that sent quarterback Lamar Jackson to Baltimore and included newcomer Zach Metz in Chicago, Singletary proved himself valuable beyond expectation by running for two touchdowns against the Bengals.

"Singletary brings not only speed but also agility into our offense," said Buffalo Bills head coach Sean McDermott after watching his rookie's impressive performance on Saturday night at 8:15 PM ET, according to NFL Network reporter Tom Pelissero. "He will be a crucial piece in my plans for the rest of this season."

Singletary earned NFLDraftScout.com’s fourth-ranked college running back prospect rating and has since made headlines with his performances at Ohio State University, where he rushed for 13 touchdowns last year while playing primarily as a receiver in passing situations during the first three weeks of this season before becoming more involved downfield late in games. His explosive legs have been noted by experts such as ESPN's Mel Kiper Jr., who remarked: "If Singletary continues to improve his receiving skills, he could end up being one of my top rookie running back selections."

As for Buffalo Bills coach McDermott and head strength and conditioning coach Dan Magoo praising their recruit's performance over the weekend, here were some excerpts from an interview with both: "He has been a tremendous addition to our offense," said Coach Magoo.

Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen played just as well this past Sunday against Baltimore Ravens defensive captain Marquise Brown and had two touchdown passes for the rookie, earning NFLDraftScout.com’s fifth-ranked QB rating in college play last season before entering his professional career with a strong foundation already built up by Singletary's contribution on offense so far this year: "The team is riding high after three consecutive wins and it feels great being at the helm of our progress," said Allen, who has thrown for 15 touchdowns in just five games.

With both rookie running back Singletary leading Buffalo's ground game as well as quarterback Josh Allen setting career best with his arm while also contributing on special teams and blocking when needed like he did last week during the Bills’ O-line revival at midfield against Baltimore, it seems this upcoming Thursday night clashup vs. New Orleans Saints will test Buffalo once again as they attempt to stay undefeated before facing Miami in AFC wildcard playoff round on December 4th – but for now the Bills are just focused on keeping momentum going after their big win: "We'll continue working towards that goal and doing everything we can."

In an interview with former Ohio State star receiver Sam Hubbard who was also called up last week to fill in as Singletary’s backup while he rested from the previous game, here are some quotes reflecting on how happy they were for their teammates' success
