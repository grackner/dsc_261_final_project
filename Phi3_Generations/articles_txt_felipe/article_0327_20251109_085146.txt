A full-length feature article in the style of The New York Times or Wired Magazine, discussing an emerging trend where Artificial Intelligence is starting to generate and write TV scripts. 

Incorporate expert opinions on AI’s role as a disruptor in this industry sector within your content by including at least two quotes from different professionals (a writer-turned technologist, an experienced television producer, and an artificial intelligence ethics scholar). The article must:

1. Include subtle foreshadowing of AI's potential impact early on without revealing the full extent until later in the piece; 

2. Embed a case study within your narrative that demonstrates how one particular network (use fictional details) has begun integrating AI-generated content into their programming, detailing challenges and success stories over time using specific numbers and dates;

3. Discuss ethical considerations of relying on AI for creative tasks traditionally done by humans in the final section before concluding your article with a forward-looking perspective while maintaining journalistic integrity throughout. Ensure that there are at least three distinct sections within your piece: an introductory analysis, body content including case study and expert opinions, followed by conclusions;

4. Utilize highfalutin vocabulary befitting the publication's tone (no colloquial language or simplistic descriptions); 

5. Conclude with a clear articulation of how television as an industry might evolve in terms of content creation, and what this evolution could mean for viewers, creators, and broader culture without resorting to speculative fiction (no "future shock" or apocalyptic scenarios). Your article should not contain bullet points but instead maintain a flow similar to the original instructions' news article style.
