A massive earthquake struck near Tokyo at approximately 3:15 PM local time yesterday with a preliminary magnitude of 7.8 on the Richter scale according to reports from seismic monitoring stations around Japan and global networks such as US Geological Survey (USGS) and European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC). The tremor originated offshore, close to Tokyo Bay but had devastating consequences in densely populated areas including Shibuya ward.

The Japan Meteorological Agency warned of a tsunami threat with waves expected to reach as high as 2 meters within the next two hours after initial quake reports were issued and evacuation orders began rolling out across impacted regions, affecting an estimated 500,000 residents. As one official from local government stated, "It's a calamity of unprecedented scale in Tokyo; we urgently need to set up temporary shelters for those displaced by the quake and tsunami."

A witness recounted seeing chaos as he was walking home after work when his neighborhood started rocking. "It felt like a giant truck drove over me, then everything went dark," said Hiroshi Yamamoto, who now finds himself without electricity or running water in one of the hardest-hit parts of Tokyo where hundreds were made homeless by collapsing buildings and flooding streets after waves crashed ashore.

The 2016 World Risk Index estimates that around $4 billion could be lost to natural disasters every year, a sum set against Japan's GDP which stood at about $5 trillion in the same fiscal period last December. However, experts stress there is no direct correlation between global climate change and seismic activity but are not ruling out potential indirect links through ocean temperature anomalies or geological changes resulting from environmental degradation.

"There's always a chance that what we consider as natural disasters might be influenced by broader climatic variations affecting our planet on large timescales," says Dr Jane Smithson, climate scientist at Tokyo University who was not involved in the research quoted earlier about possible connections between earthquakes and global warming. "The reality is that these links are complex with numerous variables playing a part."

Despite being one of Japan's most developed nations when it comes to disaster preparedness, millions worldwide continue living under constant threat from natural calamities such as typhoons or tsunami events according to United Nations data. The international community expressed solidarity with the victims and offered aid through avenues like foreign governments' emergency assistance teams deployed overseas along with NGOs providing relief efforts in affected cities across Japan including Tokyo, Yokohama, Osaka among others which saw similar aftershock tremors following yesterday’s quake.

Preliminary damage assessment indicates that thousands of buildings have been rendered uninhabitable due to structural weaknesses exacerbated by repeated seismic activities occurring more frequently in recent years - another factor experts say might be tied indirectly with the consequences of climate change on geological behavior as sea levels rise and atmospheric temperatures increase.

Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has vowed to deploy all available resources while urging citizens not only here but globally facing similar threats from nature disaster - calling for international co
