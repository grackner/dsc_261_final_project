A devastating flood hit Uganda's capital, Kampala, late last night causing significant damage to homes and infrastructure across different neighborhoods within the city according to local reports. The deluge began unexpectedly around midnight with heavy rainfall leading authorities to issue a warning for potential flash-flooding as water levels rapidly rose in several low-lying areas near Lake Victoria, which feeds into Kampala's drainage system.

"We have never seen anything like this before," stated Moses Okello, Mayor of Wakiso District where most affected neighborhoods lie close to the lake shore. 

As dawn broke today at around 7am local time (UTC+3), rescuers were still searching for people trapped in their homes while others have already been evacuated due to concerns about rising water levels and potential landslides, which often follow torrential downpours in this part of Africa.

In the village of Rukiga located just a few miles from Lake Victoria on its western shore was one such case where over 30 homes were completely destroyed by floodwaters that also engulfed several acres of farmland, leaving more than 50 families without shelter or livelihood for at least weeks if not months to come.

Local resident Elizabeth Akankusi watched helplessly as the swolthesting water from what seemed like an endless deluge gutted her home and destroyed all she had worked years on building up: "I built this house myself, with my own hands - it's heartbreaking to see everything washed away."

Water levels have receded slightly since the peak last night but continue rising in other areas. The Ugandan Red Cross Society says about 200 people are still seeking shelter and that at least two lives may be lost before all those affected find safety again, as some trapped by floodwaters could not be reached due to road blockages caused both directly from the rains themselves or landslides.

"Emergency services teams continue working round-the-clock trying their best under these challenging circumstances," said Charles Musinguzi of Uganda's Emergency Services, "but we fear some victims might still be waiting to come out alive."

Experts warn that more rains are forecasted for the area in the coming days which could further complicate rescue efforts and potentially lead new floods if not properly managed. 

"The situation is dire - I worry about my relatives living close by who have also heard rumors of landslides," said Elizabeth Akankusi after being evacuated herself to a temporary shelter in the city outskirts where thousands were expected to seek refuge as well, "We need immediate help."

The Ugandan government and various international NGOs are working together with local officials trying provide food aid for displaced people while providing clean drinking water remains an issue. 30 tonnes of grain donated by the UN has been sent to a central warehouse where it will be distributed among relief camps across Kampala as well as other affected areas in Uganda, but this may not meet demand yet due its arrival today alone and with more rainfall forecasted for tomorrow morning.

Grace Nalwoga of the United Nations' Food Programme (UNFP) said: "This disaster is unprecedented - it has severely impacted lives, livelihoods in
