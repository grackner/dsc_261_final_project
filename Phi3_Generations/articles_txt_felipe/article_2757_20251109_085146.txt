A powerful winter storm battered New York City on Thursday night with up to two feet of snow expected in some areas and wind chill warnings issued throughout Manhattan and Brooklyn as temperatures hover between sub-zero degrees Celsius and negative five degrees Fahrenheit (−18°C, −26°F).

The arctic blast has resulted in dangerous road conditions across the city's boroughs. New York City Mayor Eric Adams warned residents to stay off roads where possible after several vehicles were reported overturned due to black ice and strong wind gusts of up to 40 mph (65 km/h).

"This is a dangerous time for us in the city, with snow accumulating at an alarming rate," said Mayor Adams. "I urge everyone to stay home unless absolutely necessary."

As people hunker down inside their homes or offices until conditions improve this afternoon, temperatures are expected to warm slightly and light rain showers will fall overnight into Friday morning before the cold returns for a second freeze later in the day after 36 hours of snowfall. The National Weather Service (NWS) is monitoring wind gusts from Thursday night as they could surpass dangerous levels on Friday, with speeds reaching up to 45 mph at times and sustained strong breezes throughout Saturday morning in all five boroughs before settling into a high-pressure ridge during the weekend.

"The snowfall is expected to be heavy across areas from New Jersey down through Manhattan, with accumulations up to two feet possible," said meteorologist Laura Johnson of NWS Weather Forecast Office in Upton, NY. "Wind chill advisories are also being issued because the combination will result in extremely cold temperatures that could cause frostbite on exposed skin within minutes."

Commuters have been advised against traveling across all five boroughs with public transit lines suspended between midnight and 8am. Streets crews worked through Thursday night to clear roads while New York Governor Kathy Hochul announced additional funding of $10 million for plow operators, snow fighters, overtime wages paid out directly into the city's unemployment compensation system in anticipation of more storm-related disrus.

"New Yorkers are resilient and can get through this together," said Governor Hochul on Thursday afternoon when asked about potential impact to commerce if businesses decide not to operate during snowfall days as usual due to concerns over transporting goods, supplies or services in hazardous conditions with vehicles skidding easily. "We're prepared for the long term; we can handle this."

The New York City Department of Transportation released a statement that said: 
"DOT crews are working tirelessly to keep city roads safe and clear during these frigid temperatures," Director Montgomery McFadden stated, "It's critical for all residents to stay home whenever possible until the storm passes." 

Despite heavy snowfall throughout Thursday night into Friday morning across most of New York City with accumulations ranging from six inches up in some areas like Midtown Manhattan and Queens boroughs that have already recorded two feet since Tuesday afternoon, temperatures did drop to a record low on Wednesday at negative 15 degrees Celsius (negative nine degrees Fahrenheit) before rebounding back into the single digits
