Topic: World - Middle East

In a dramatic event unfolding in Jerusalem today, Israeli forces were reported to have clashed with Palestinian protesters near Al-Aqsa Mosque compound late yesterday evening, reports CNN. As of this morning local time (06:30 GMT), the situation remains tense as both sides await international intervention calls for peace talks that broke down last month.

Hundreds of demonstrators took to East Jerusalem's Temple Mount after sunset in a protest aimed at preventing Israeli security forces from reclaiming control over holy sites, sparking clashes with troops enforcing curfew orders by the army and police inside Israel as well as settlers within occupied Palestinian territories. The violent confrontations were witnessed near Al-Aqsa Mosque compound which is sacred to Muslims worldwide while also being a pivotal point for Jews, one of many reasons why it sits at the heart of Israeli politics and conflict in this region dating back centuries ago according to reports.

“We're doing everything within our power to maintain order,” says IDF spokesperson Galit Edelstein who adds that she expects calm will soon return as security forces work on dispersing protesters while ensuring they do not resort back towards violence against each other nor those enforcing the curfew.

Local human rights organizations report 25 injured including four civilians, three Israeli soldiers and ten Palestinians with more clashes expected throughout today in Jerusalem as well as Bethlehem (10 miles) following yesterday's events that have already garnered international concern over the potential risks of escalating violence if left unchecked.

Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas condemned what he called "brutal attacks on Palestinians" and urged for a ceasefire while Israeli officials argue they are taking necessary measures to protect Jewish worshippers from potential harm by protesters, who according to them have resorted back towards violence even after being dispersed multiple times before.

“We believe that these recent developments show the need for renewed diplomatic efforts and peace talks,” said a European Union official quoted in an exclusive interview with CNN’s Chief International Correspondent Jim Acosta, speaking from Brussels where EUs representatives are due to meet Israel's Justice Minister today. 

“There has been too much division between parties for far too long now that it is time we try and bridge the gap.”

The United Nations Human Rights Council condemned what they said were "violations" taking place within Jerusalem, specifically mentioning Al-Aqsa Mosque compound where several Palestinians have reportedly been beaten by Israeli forces while some are missing. Amidst this growing unrest in the region amid escalating tensions on both sides following a breakdown of peace talks last month - experts suggest that international efforts to restore calm may not bear fruit without strong political will shown from all parties involved, warning against further delays as regional stability continues its downward spiral.

A local activist group spokesperson adds: “We cannot afford another summer like the one we had last year where protests and violence only left devastation behind.” 

Reports continue streaming in of damage caused to historic sites, shops owned by Palestinians as well Israeli settlers have reportedly been involved throughout yesterday's confrontations with both sides exchanging verbal abuse while
