A robbery at a New Jersey bank took place this past Tuesday morning with unexpected turns that have left both law enforcement and citizens on edge in nearby towns such as Atlantic City. Early Wednesday afternoon, authorities were informed by an off-duty officer who witnessed the crime unfold from his home across town around 10:35 AM ET when three masked individuals approached a local bank branch of First Community Bank located at 456 Sunrise Ave., Atlantic City. According to eyewitness accounts, two robbers physically subdued the security guard while he was conducting routine operations inside the establishment around midday hours as noted in reports from an officer present on scene and employees interviewed later that evening at 4 PM ET by The DailyMail's journalists.

The off-duty police officer, who prefers to remain anonymous due to safety concerns for his family, shared with us what he witnessed: "I heard the commotion from my backyard window and saw them breaking down doors at 10:35 AM ET - three masked men in dark clothing. The guards inside didn't even realize who they were until it was too late." His account led to a rapid response by law enforcement, with the first officers arriving within minutes of his call and subsequent patrol cars speeding towards Sunrise Ave., Atlantic City from surrounding areas including Ventnor City Police Department which is just over seven miles away.

The New Jersey State Police are still investigating how these individuals managed to evade capture for several hours before being located by an off-duty officer's call, though it appears they may have been armed during their illicit activities given the presence of a security guard on site and unsettling rumors circulating among local residents. In response to this alarming event impacting our community members here in Atlantic City along with neighboring towns like Ventnor Beach or Margate; Mayor Elizabeth Turner addressed yesterday afternoon's press conference where she said, "As your mayor I want you all to know that safety is my top priority and we are working relentlessly around the clock on this investigation."

The bank manager of First Community Bank has been praised for his professionalism in handling such a stressful situation by both employees interviewed yesterday evening at 4 PM ET as well as members from our own investigative team here. He stated during an exclusive phone conversation today, "Our staff were very brave and did everything they could to follow protocol until help arrived."

As this investigation continues; local leaders urge citizens not only on personal vigilance but also emphasizing the importance of reporting suspicious activities as soon as possible which will aid law enforcement officers in keeping our city safe.
