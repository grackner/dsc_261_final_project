A culinary revolution seems to have taken root in a small town known for its quaint cafes and local delicacies. Chef Amelia Rousseau has recently opened her French bistro right at the heart of Savannah, Georgia – just months before Hurricane Florence hit with devastating force on October 10th last year. Despite initial expectations that this charming eatery might suffer damage or closures in the aftermath of such a powerful storm surge and floodwaters submerging parts of downtown Savannah, Amelia's establishment not only survived but has thrived even more lately as patrons flock from all over to taste her revitalized menu.

Amelia Rousseau took charge when the hurricane struck and decided that she couldn’t let it stall her culinary dream any longer, "We're known for our food here in Savannah; there is no place we can call home until my bistro opens." She says this resilience became a core part of what makes Amelia's French Bistro so special.

After the hurricane passed and recovery efforts began, residents found themselves without many dining options due to nearby establishments being closed for extended periods or struggling financially post-disaster relief expenditures took precedence over other investments like new menus in town's cafes and restaurants. Chef Amelia seized this opportunity when she saw that locals were still looking for a place with affordable yet high quality food to eat after the disruptions of evacuations, power outages, and infrastructure repairs which followed Hurricane Florence’s landfall on October 10th last year.

Her menu took inspiration from traditional French cuisine while integrating local seafood caught just a few miles off Savannah's coast in St. Catherines Sound - making it uniquely tailored to the townspeople, who have always had an appreciation for international flavors alongside their own Southern culinary roots. She adds seasonal fruits and vegetables sourced from local farmers markets into her dishes ensuring freshness while also supporting regional agriculture that helped Savannah recover economically after the hurricane struck with unprecedented intensity, dumping an estimated 5 inches of rain on parts of Georgia in just two days.

“The French bistro has become something more than a place to eat,” says long-time diner and local resident Michael Johnson who regularly visits Amelia's establishment after work at the nearby convention center which remained open even during this trying time for Savannah’s tourism industry due in part because it was one of few facilities that survived without major structural damage. “It brings a sense of normalcy back into our lives, and we know there are real people behind every plate.”

Members of the local Chamber of Commerce have praised Amelia's efforts by expressing their gratitude for contributing to economic recovery in Savannah during these tough times. The mayor herself commended this culinary gem saying "We may face challenges, but it’s heartening to see how our community comes together after hardship—showcasing true Southern spirit through supportive eateries like Amelia's."

For Chef Rousseau and her team of dedicated chefs, the hurricane has brought them closer as a family. They continue cooking in shifts during weekdays while hosting small-
