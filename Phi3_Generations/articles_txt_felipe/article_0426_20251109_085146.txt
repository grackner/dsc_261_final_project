PARIS (CNN) -- The EU is launching a sweeping investigation into the rise of unrealistic makeup standards in popular media and social networking sites across Europe.

The probe comes after years of growing concerns over body image issues among young adults following trends on platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube. Researchers claim that false beauty ideals promoted by celebrities end up causing self-esteem problems in thousands every year. As the issue grows more pressing for EU health authorities worldwide to acknowledge its impact -- from mental health issues such as anxiety and depression to dangerous eating habits among impressionable youths, including instances of bulimia nervosa or other forms of unhealthy dieting practices resulting in hospitalizations.

EU Health Commissioner Dr. Viviane Rey announced the initiative at a press conference last night outside her office on Rue de la Philosophie near Louvre Museum and Place Vendôme, where she emphasized that this issue extends far beyond France's borders: "This is about European health standards." She further added,"If we want to maintain our social fabric without damaging the psychological well-being of future generations, then it becomes imperative for us as a community and leaders in Europe who have access to resources like these tools that can be used constructively. We owe nothing less than an earnest effort."

EU spokesperson Marion Dupont said at yesterday's press conference: "It was important we address this problem head-on before more irreparable damage is done while allowing for cultural nuances across Europe in our approach to tackling the issue effectively. We will be working with various national regulatory bodies and industry leaders towards creating standards that ensure positive representation of beauty without compromising individual self-esteem."

In Paris, social media expert Jacques Lefevre told CNN's European desk: "This is just another symptom in a disease we all know too well—the culture around us being constantly fed with artificially perfect images and content that set unattainable standards for everyday people who are trying hard enough to look good. This issue transcends national boundaries, but the urgency of action remains more significant within each member country due its cultural differences."

As a precautionary measure until further notice, French influencers have pledged not to promote products or services that enhance physical appearance beyond natural abilities through makeup techniques. They also agreed on promoting authentic and relatable content instead of photo-manipulation images often found online today for healthier representations amongst followers' eyesight towards beauty in the world, which experts claim will encourage a positive body image culture across Europe as well."

Dr. Sylvie Laurent from Sorbonne University Paris Diderot said: "The current trend of unrealistic makeup standards has become detrimental to self-esteem issues for many young adults, especially girls and women in their teens and twenties who are at a vulnerable stage where they should feel more empowered than ever before."

Dr. Laurent stressed the need "for genuine representation of diverse beauty standards within European media as well as proper guidance on how to
