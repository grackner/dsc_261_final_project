India's Environmental Crisis: Exacgy Plans to Shut Down Coal Power Plant Amidst Climate Concerns and Economic Pressure | The India Conversation - YouTube

Tuesday, July 13th - New Delhi, INDIA — As the world increasingly turns its focus on renewable energy sources in an effort to combat climate change, some sectors of this sprawling nation still heavily rely on coal power. However, as India grapples with economic and environmental challenges alike, steps towards a cleaner future are becoming more apparent.

The most notable among these is the planned shutdown of one such behemoth in New Delhi that has long been synonymous for contributing to pollution — the Singhu Haryana Thermal Power Station. The power plant, which boasted 60-megawatt capacity back when it first started operations over five decades ago, was built with an eye towards meeting the growing energy demands of India's burgeoning population and industrial sector but has since come under intense scrutiny for its carbon footprint.

"We understand that coal plants contribute to air pollution; they are also one of our biggest sources of greenhouse gas emissions," a spokesperson from the Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change confirmed when asked about closing down this aging relic last week during a roundtable discussion with industry experts. The government's decision comes after years of pressure and criticism on its heavy dependence on coal power for nearly 80% of India’s energy production capacity as well as to comply with international climate agreements like the Paris Agreement, which seeks to limit global warming by drastically reducing emissions.

Dr. Suresh Gupta - a leading environmental scientist who has been studying local air quality for years — commended this move towards clean energy but cautioned that while shutting down old coal plants is beneficial in the long term, it should be paired with investment and development of renewable options to truly tackle climate change.

According to data from the Central Electricity Authority (CEA), which manages electric utilities across India, around 25%-30% of all power generated in the country comes from coal plants as per last fiscal year's records — translating into approximately four billion metric tons worth annually.

The Singhu Haryana Thermal Power Station was among those that have been contributing significantly to this figure, emitting roughly 120,000 tonnes of CO2 every day since its inception as it burned through millions upon billions kilograms of coal annually. However, plans are underway for the shutdown scheduled sometime around November and replacement by more environmentally friendly alternatives such as solar farms or nuclear energy plants is on government’s priority list.

"We understand that our journey towards clean energy will not be easy but taking steps like these makes us responsible global citizens," Prime Minister Narendra Modi stated during a recent press conference addressing his administration's climate change initiatives where he pledged to reduce India's carbon emissions by 30-40% from its peak levels in the fiscal year of 2015/2016.

Critics, on the other hand, argue that although these steps are commendable they will take time before seeing tangible results — considering India's growing population and energy needs as
