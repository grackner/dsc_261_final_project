A rare and unexplained power outage during a major baseball game yesterday night has left fans and players alike bewildered as they await explanations from officials at the stadium in question — Fenway Park, Boston’s iconic ballpark where last night'thrown-in pitcher David Price was facing off against his former team.

At precisely 7:45 PM EDT, just before a home run blast by rookie shortstop Manny Pagliano that would have tied the game at two apiece when suddenly, darkness fell across all sectors of Fenway Park where thousands had gathered to watch their favorite team on an electrifying night.

“The power went out in 20 seconds flat," said one fan sitting near home plate who heard a loud pop followed by total blackout at the moment Pagliano was due for his next pitch, perplexing everyone within earshot including those players still wearing their uniforms on game day with no immediate signs of light returning.

It took over half an hour before emergency generators kicked in to provide dim and flickering backup power that lasted until midnight when full stadium capacity fans were asked by staff members once again left wondering about the cause behind this mysterious interruption — some speculate a cyber attack while others think it might be more down to human error or an overload on one of Fenway’s electrical lines.

The Boston Red Sox announced that they would investigate with both local utility and stadium maintenance personnel involved in pinpointing exactly when, where within the ballpark infrastructure this blackout occurred as well what may have triggered it initially if found not to be a fault on their end or beyond control at Fenway Park.

“We apologize for any inconvenience our fans experienced tonight,” said Red Sox spokesperson Patrick Garvey who confirmed that while no immediate cause could yet be determined, the club would work alongside city officials and experts as needed throughout this unprecedented incident which is already sparking debates across social media platforms regarding electricity grid reliability in New England.

“This sort of situation should never happen again,” said former Major League pitcher Mark Prior who added that he played during similar blackouts years ago but noted, “Now with more technology involved and such a large audience expecting constant power throughout these games we must ensure this doesn't occur.” 

A Fenway Park official also confirmed they would bring in an engineering expert specializing in stadium electrical systems to examine the situation further while not ruling out any possibilities including potential sabotage as part of their investigative efforts: “We are doing everything within our control,” said park manager Tom Griswold, adding that he understands fans’ concerns about possible foul play.

Meanwhile baseball reporters in attendance noted how strange it was to see players and coaches holding hands on the field under candlelight while trying not make too much noise which could interfere with communication between umpires who rely solely upon each other’s calls given that lights hadn't returned yet. 

CNN has reached out for comment from several sources about this strange evening at Fenway Park and will publish updates as soon a credible source can verify any aspect of the story further down in tomorrow’s edition alongside related baseball news pieces focusing on other aspects such player performances or matchups that may have taken place despite disrusruption. 

It remains unclear whether this incident affects future scheduled Red Sox
