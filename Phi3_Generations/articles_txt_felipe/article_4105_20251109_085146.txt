Dallas Cowboys cornerback Jayron Hens beat out a Dallas rival for first-team honors on Saturday during practice at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. The victory is particularly notable as it occurs despite the team's recent struggles to maintain their status as perennial NFL contenders since 1970 — an accomplishment known as the "Evil Empire" moniker given by Washington Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke in 1964.

Hens, who hails from Cedartown High School near Columbus, Georgia and played football for Mississippi State University before transferring to Florida Atlantic University last season — where he saw limited action— is a standout performer this training camp weekend according to head coach Mike McCarthy: "Jayron's relentless pursuit of excellence has earned him his spot as the top cornerback on our first team. His exceptional speed and agility have been key factors in several victories."

This triumph comes after a string of disappointing losses, with Cowboys fans anxiously awaiting this season's performance which officially started last Sunday when Dallas hosted their divisional rival Eagles at Lincoln Finan065842 1 Center Stadium. The match ended in a tough defeat for the team — one that was especially troubling given quarterback Dak Prescott’s stellar play, throwing for three touchdown passes and running two scores himself before suffering an injury during the game's second half:

"As much as we love Dallas, it's unfortunate to see us struggle lately against formidable opponents," said Atlanta Falcons head coach Arthur Smith after their encounter. "Dallas has always been a tough out for our team." 

Since then, the Cowboys have faced New Orleans Saints and Seattle Seahawks in back-to-back losses at home — with Dallas losing twice to Tampa Bay Buccaneers during recent bye weeks as well. Despite some positive play from Prescott since his return last week against Arizona Cardinals after missing time due to injury, the Cowboys are looking for consistency and cohesiveness amongst their players in an attempt to end a five-game losing streak that has put them near the bottom of their division:

"Our objective is simple — play better football on both sides of the ball," said Dallas defensive coordinator Dan Quinn. "We need our offense and defense working together seamlessly in order for us to succeed." 

The Cowboys will face Los Angeles Rams this Sunday, where they hope to make a strong start at home after hosting Atlanta Falcons next Saturday: "[This is] the perfect time for Dallas," said quarterback Prescott. "It's important that we begin with wins like these and build momentum moving forward." 

As Hens continues his impressive performance during practice, Cowboys fans can look to their cornerback as one of the bright spots on a team in dire need for improvement: "[Jayron] gives us great hope. He's got an incredible work ethic and he knows how important it is that we come together," said wide receiver Michael Irvin, who has long served as mentor to Prescott during his time with the Dallas squad from 1987-2000 before retiring: "He reminds me of myself when I was in my prime."
