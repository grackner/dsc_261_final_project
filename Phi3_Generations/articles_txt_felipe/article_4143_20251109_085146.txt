As a bustling hub of culture and history, Istanbul has long been one of Turkey's top tourist attractions. However, in an unprecedented turn for the city known as 'The City Between', recent discoveries at ancient sites within its boundaries are now sparking worldwide interest once more - a trend that travel experts predict will see Istanbul regain much-needed popularity among international tourists by 2025.

A joint expedition between Turkish archaeologists and British historians has unearthed remarkable artifacts near the city's storied Hagia Sophia, bringing to light a previously unknown chapter in Constantinople's rich history dating back nearly two thousand years ago when it was the capital of the Byzantine Empire.

The discovery included exquisite mosaics adorning what is believed to have been an emperor's palace within Istanbul, providing fascinating insight into daily life during this pivotal era in world history. "This finding will certainly put Istanbul back on the map as a premier destination for travelers seeking immersion into historical cultures," says renowned archaeologist Dr. Yasemin Özkaya from Ankara University, who led the expedition team which consisted of experts hailing mostly from Britain and France along with Turkish academics.

Museum curator Murat Demirtaş echoed these sentiments as he awaited transportation to his new role at what is now set up for a special exhibit showcasing some 150 rare pieces uncovered over the last six months in various historic neighborhoods around Istanbul. "I'm absolutely thrilled about bringing such an important slice of our past into people’s living rooms across Europe and beyond," he tells CNN.

The exhibition is expected to open later this year at the Museum of Islamic Art, one of five institutions set up by Turkish authorities specifically for preserving newly discovered artifacts found during government-sponsored archaeological digs in different parts of Istanbul including Sultanahmet's historical monuments and Beyoglu's cultural enclaves.

Local Mayor Ekrem İslam shared his enthusiasm, adding that he hoped the new findings would prompt an influx not just from Western visitors but also encourage locals to explore their city’s hidden gems further afield during breaks or weekends away on work-free days this fall. “It's essential for people here in Istanbul and even Turks living abroad who might want some quiet time back home with a real cultural experience, not just the typical tourist traps they always visit,” he explained last month at city hall meeting where officials announced plans to promote these newfound artifacts as major points of interest on travel itineraries.

While Turkish culture and history remain significant drawcards for international visitors who wish for an authentic glimpse into a civilization that was once the epicenter of Christendom, Istanbul's recent discoveries promise to inject some much-needed freshness in attracting even more tourists interested specifically within European travel sectors back after years of relative stagnation following political unrest and economic crisis.

Experts speculate that these findings may also contribute towards boosting local economy by generating increased spending on souvenirs, cuisine experiences from new restaurants opening up around excavated sites or in newly established museums along with growing employment opportunities within cultural preservation and
