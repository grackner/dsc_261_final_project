A powerful storm sweeping across Southern Europe has left at least four people dead and over a thousand injured as of yesterday afternoon, according to local authorities in Italy, Greece, and Spain. The disaster struck with unexpected intensity on Monday evening when hail the size of baseballs pounded the region's cities during peak hours around midday, catching citizens off guard without adeCTime or notice. 

The storm unleashed chaos across Europe as it raced towards Italy from Greece and Spain through Wednesday night with temperatures unexpectedly dropping by more than ten degrees Fahrenheit within a few hours' timeframe in several major cities, such as Rome, Athens, Madrid, Barcelona. Meteorologists have described the hailstorm as one of the most severe they recall seeing firsthand during their careers and it has since been dubbed "the European Hailstorm."

"It was a monster storm that showed no mercy," said Prof. John Smith from London's School for Atmospheric Studies, who arrived in Spain last night to assess the damage on site with his team of scientists and researchers. The professor added: "The hailstones came down so quickly we barely had time to react before taking cover ourselves."

In Rome alone, authorities reported that a dozen cars were flipped over by the wind as skyscrapers swayed under an unprecedented 108-mph gusts of wind. The storm's aftermath brought life on halt across Italy with many businesses forced to close their doors indefinitely while schools and universities have been shut down until further notice due to safety concerns amidst the damage caused by high speed hailstones, estimated between 5-7 inches (13x2.8cm) that struck windowsills at speeds of up to 60mph(97km/h).

The Greek island of Corfu bore witnesses its share of destruction as well; with an entire flock of about 4,500 olive trees destroyed by the hailstones. Local farmers like Dimitrios Stavridis said he lost his livelihood in just a matter hours on Monday afternoon after heavy winds and rains arrived from Germany at midnight last night followed shortly afterwards with thick clouds of ice falling across his property as early morning sunrise was obscured by billowing mist carrying chunks of frozen water.

A spokesman for the European Meteorological Agency (EUMET Office) confirmed that weather conditions in Europe were "anomalously unstable" but added: “The hailstorm wasn't caused by climate change, as our research suggests such natural phenomena occur on a regular basis." He further cautioned all citizens across the continent to stay indoors when possible until these atmospheric systems subside and urged governments at regional levels not only provide immediate emergency relief for those affected but also invest in building more robust infrastructure capable of withstanding severe weather events like this one.

In Spain, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has pledged full support to the victims by launching a national disaster fund and dispatched specialized rescue teams across severely damaged regions within hours after receiving news about Europe's first-ever "hailstorm" event that occurred 240 miles east of Barcelona, near Gibraltar.
