Topic: Health - Sleep

HANOI – A new study reveals that Vietnam's sleep deprivation problem may affect millions of citizens due to increased work hours and screen time before bedtime. The researchers surveyed more than 10,00 endpoints across Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), Hanoi, Da Nang, Quang Ninh, and Binh Duong from January until March this year. According to the findings published in "Sleep Health Journal," nearly half of adults between ages eighteen and thirty-five report less than six hours of sleep a night – far below the recommended seven to nine hours for optimal health.

"It's shocking yet worryingly consistent with global trends,” said Dr. Tran Van Hoa, one of Vietnam’s leading neurologists specializing in circadian rhythm disorders who reviewed preliminary data from HCMC but was not involved directly in the study team or research design process. "We're seeing a direct correlation between late-night screen time and poorer sleep quality."

The extensive survey, funded by Vietnamese health organizations along with international grants like those of National Sleep Foundation (NSF), assessed factors including bedtime routines, commute times to work or school locations from different locales within the country. In Hanoi alone – where nearly one-third live in crowded urban apartments crammed together as small living spaces can often become home offices during working hours - 76% admitted using their phone for more than an hour before bed, while only about half said they get adequate sleep on weekdays.

A Hanoi university student named Nguyen Hoang Vuong shares his experience: "I work long days and come home to start studying or watch videos online with friends until late night; I barely fall asleep before midnight." Many of these young adults rely heavily on smartphones for academic, social networking purposes – a habit that can often lead them into mindless scrolling well past their bedtime.

This problem is not limited to youth alone: the study reports 38% of working-age Vietnamese citizens between twenty and fifty years old admit they've had difficulty falling asleep in recent months, while nearly half say work stress directly affects how quickly or deeply one can sleep at night after returning home from a long day. In terms of geographical spread throughout the country: The study reveals that regions with more industrial jobs such as Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi have higher levels of reported difficulty in falling asleep when compared to rural areas like Da Nang, Binh Duong or Quang Ninh where people typically get off work earlier.

The lead author Dr. Tran Ngoc Phuoc from the School of Health Sciences at Ho Chi Minh City University states: "It's essential for citizens and employers alike to understand this growing problem in our society, taking immediate steps towards mitigating it will improve individual well-be092ndess along with national productivity levels.”

Experts have called on the government to consider implementing stricter regulations around work schedules that ensure employees aren't required to stay at their desks late into the night. The Ministry of Health is scheduled for a meeting next week where policy changes could be discussed, while several grassroots organizations are already running sleep awareness campaigns across cities and provinces with information on creating better bedroom environments - free from technology disruptions such as phones or television screens that emit blue light before
