A sudden and unprecedented storm has ravaged one of Asia'selas elusive jewel: Mt. Fuji in Japan on Saturday morning. The usually serene landscape was overrun by heavy rainfall, hailstones the size of golf balls, and roaring winds that reached up to 80 mph at its peak as temperatures plummeted below freezing point near the summit since before dawn (16:00 JST).

Witnesses reported seeing waterfalls crash down Mt. Fuji's slopes, turning them into treacherous rivers threatening to overrun entire villages and communities situated at its base within Kawaguchi City - the nearest city to Mount Fuji’s famous crater lake, Lake Ashi.

Authorities were put on high alert after an emergency meeting was convened by Mayor Tatsuya Shindo early this morning following reports of water rushing down Mt.Fuji and threatening nearby areas due to the severe weather conditions forecasted by meteorologists from Japan’s Meteorological Agency (JMA).

"This is truly an unpredictable situation," said Deputy Mayor Yuki Kobayashi, who has been working closely with disaster response teams alongside other government officials. "We need everyone in our community to cooperate and take the right precautions immediately." 

According to local meteorologist Akira Suzuki from Tokyo's prestigious National University of Natural Sciences & Agriculture, this was a once-in-a-lifetime weather event driven by rapidly intensifying low pressure systems coming in off the Pacific Ocean which have caused temperatures at Mt. Fuji’s summit to drop significantly below freezing point while creating massive waterfalls cascading down its slopes towards villages and cities located on or near it's base areas like Kawaguchi City, Gotenba Town as well within the Shimo-Hachimangu District itself where ancient shrines dotting Mount Fuji’s crater walls were already being battered by heavy wind speeds.

As of now rescue efforts are underway with evacuation shelters having been opened across Kawaguchi City for displaced residents whose homes have been severely damaged or destroyed after hours spent battling raging rivers and torrential downpours in an attempt to reach outlying villages surrounding Lake Ashi – one of Japan's most popular tourist attractions that attract millions each year who visit its base camps for day hikes up Mt. Fuji’s iconic snow-capped peak along with overnight stays near the famous Kawaguchiko Onsen hot springs complex or at nearby traditional Japanese ryokan (inn) accommodations which have been forced to close indefinitely following Saturday morning's disaster but still offer temporary respite for some locals and visitors alike.

Mount Fuji stands majestic as Japan’s third most visited national park – one of few UNESCO world heritage sites - with over 310,000 annual visits recorded according to local tourism boards data released last year; however these numbers are expected to be devastated after this weekend's tragedy as experts predict thousands will need financial aid while small businesses face closures along Mt Fuji’s surrounding area that accounts for more than a fifth of GDP within Yamanashi prefecture alone.
