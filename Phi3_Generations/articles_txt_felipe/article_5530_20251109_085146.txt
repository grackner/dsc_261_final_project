As voters head to polls across Georgia on Tuesday in a highly anticipated runoff election for two U.CThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports that early voting numbers are trending higher than expected with around one million eligible Georgians set to cast their ballots, potentially shifting the balance of power in both chambers of Congress and on Capitol Hill itself.

Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensberger attributes this surge primarily to high-quality candidates rallying voters from diverse demographics throughout the Peach State: "We are seeing strong participation as we approach Election Day," said he told reporters earlier today at a news conference in Atlanta.

The Associated Press adds that early voting turnout for this runoff has already surpassed President Biden's record of nearly 57 million Americans casting ballots on the first Tuesday after Labor Day, setting new records both nationally and state-wide as Georgia citizens ready themselves to vote between now until November 3rd.

In a sign that this election could set precedents for years to come in how future midterms are conducted across America's southern states, CNN reports several key polls showing close competition among candidates at both ends of the political spectrum with recent studies by Harvard University and FiveThirtyEight demonstrating tightening margins as ballots begin rolling into counting centers.

According to CBS News, this will be Georgia Secretary Raffensberger's first major election challenge in which he personally oversees an early voting process across a historically conservative state; with polls closing at 7 p.m., local time here on Tuesday and counting continuing until all votes are counted by midnight, the race appears to be extremely competitive as of late afternoon today when first round results began emerging from Atlanta's early voting sites into a live tally feed provided exclusively by CNN for viewers watching at home.

"This is an unprecedented election in Georgia," said poll analyst Dr. James Carter, who explained that turnout rates could continue to climb as more voters arrive or register up until Election Day on November 3rd; the first runoff elections have been brought about by a pair of races for U.S. Senate seats where neither Democrat Raphael Warnock nor Republican Herschel Walker had secured enough votes in the first election to win outright, but both candidates still hold significant leads as more ballots are counted today and tomorrow before Tuesday evening when final results should be certified after a recount.

"The race is too close to call at this point," Dr. Carter stated while watching polling data streaming into CNN's live ticker from various early voting sites around Atlanta, where he expected that turnout rates would likely top 1 million if past trends are anything to go by; the Associated Press reports similar activity in runoff elections nationwide as politicians vie for control of critical seats which will have power not only over congressional legislation and appointments but also state policies ranging from healthcare accessibility, education funding levels, environmental regulations, social services provision and more.

"I've never seen turnout like this in a runoff election before," observed local Democrat Lisa Thompson while standing alongside fellow volunteers handing out campaign literature near the Civic Center Park where early voting took place today; she emphasized that Georgia voters have historically turned out sporadically for elections here but said many had
