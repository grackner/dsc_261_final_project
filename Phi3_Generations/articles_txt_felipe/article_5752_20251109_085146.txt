Hong Kong Protesters Rally Against Extraterritorial Application of US Law in Yardley Square on September 15th; Police Intervene with Non-lethal Force Amid Concerns Over Freedom of Speech and Expression, say local activists. As the protest movement continues to draw international attention this weekend following recent crackdown measures by Chinese authorities enforcing national security laws in mainland China since July 1st; some Hong Kong citizens fear similar tactics here amid growing tensions on issues ranging from governance reform to independence aspirries, reported a CNN-affiliated outlet. This Sunday's peaceful demonstration took place at Yardley Square with participants holding signs reading "Freedom for All" and demanding an end to what they call the extraterritorial application of US law on Chinese citizens living in Hong Kong - sparked by controversial remarks made last month during a congressional hearing that implied potential foreign interference. The protesters, who number around 30 according to police reports; gathered after local universities announced academic debates for the topic at noon where speakers such as former UN envoy Amina Mohammed and Nobel Laureate economist Esther Duflo were slated to take part - with turnout expected high. "We need transparency, we need justice," says Yuri Wu (pseudonym), a student organizer among the crowd gathered under Hong Kong's sunny sky. She points out that they are merely demanding what other democracies have: protection of citizens against foreign interference in national affairs - something she believes has always been an American prerogative, but is being misused here now due to fear and misunderstanding caused by the current political climate between China and the US. A statement issued from Hong Kong police headquarters following Sunday's rally read: "We understand your concerns, however we believe that these activities pose a security threat under Article 42 of our national Security Law - which allows preventive measures to be taken without trial or conviction." This response has only fuelled the public outcry among protesters and sparked further debate both locally and globally as they feel their voices are not being heard. "We need more than just words, we want action", expresses Tien Ho (pseudonym), an elderly man present in Yardley Square holding up a placard with the slogan 'Not Again'. A legal expert from University of Hong Kong speaking on neutral ground explains to media that: while extraterritorial laws are generally not enforceable within China's borders, some international treaties and agreements may have an impact depending upon specific cases - which is why this movement represents significant momentum towards demanding their rights be recognized. "It goes beyond US-China relations now; it’s about the principle of sovereignty itself," he adds on further implications for other democracies and potential global repercussions as they watch closely to see how these tensions develop in the weeks ahead - leading many here towards uncertainty.
