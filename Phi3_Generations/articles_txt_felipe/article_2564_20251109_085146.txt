A new eco-friendly resort opening in Costa Rica next year aims to revolutionize sustainable tourism in Latin America by utilizing renewable energy sources and offering an immersive wildlife experience without causing harm to the local environment or inhabitants. Set amidst protected forests, it will be built with locally sourced materials within two miles of one of Costa Rica's most pristine national parks—Palo Verde National Park. The resort is set to open its doors in April 2nerally powered by solar panels and small hydroelectric plants that utilize the park’s natural waterways, with guest accommodations built from sustainably harvested wood and other renewable materials.

"We are setting a new standard for eco-friendly resorts in Latin America," said CEO Maria Gonzalez of Tierra Azul Ecotourism Resort. "By working closely with the local community, we want to create an immersive experience that highlights not just our country's natural beauty but also its rich cultural heritage."

The resort’s design will incorporate living walls and green roofs into accommodation units as well as common areas; water recycling systems for all guest suites, which includes graywater treatment to make it safe enough for irrigating the surrounding landscapes. The team also hopes that guests can participate in reforestation efforts by planting native trees and flowers on site each day of their stay.

The resort has been designed with an emphasis on minimizing its ecological footprint, working closely with local architects and engineers who share a vision for responsible travel experiences within the country's biodiverse rainforests while also contributing to conservation efforts that protect endangered species such as jaguars and scarlet macaws.

Dr. Alejandro Mendoza of Costa Rica’s National Park Service said: "The partnership between Tierra Azul Ecotourism Resort and Palo Verde National Park is a promising example for the entire travel industry in our country." Dr. Ana Paniagua, an ecologist specializing in sustainable tourism practices who has worked with other companies across Latin America, added: "This resort will undoubtedly serve as a model for how to balance human enjoyment and environmental responsibility within one of the most fragile areas on our planet."

Guests at Tierra Azul Ecotourism Resort will have access not only to accommodations but also nature-based activities like guided hikes, birdwatching expeditions, canoe trips down nearby waterways with expert naturalist tour leaders and opportunities for educational workshops on the importance of sustainable travel.

A local community leader from a village near Palo Verde National Park spoke about his excitement surrounding Tierra Azul's opening: "We are proud that our home will now be known as one where we offer unique, responsible experiences to visitors while also preserving and protecting the precious environment in which we live."

Terra Incognita is set within a region of unparalleled beauty—lush rainforests bordered by breathtaking waterfalls cascading down cliffs into crystal clear rivers, nestled amidst undisturbed wilderness. Guests will have the opportunity to explore these natural treasures through eco-friendly transportation options such as electric off-road vehicles and bicycles that offer zero emissions while also providing safe access for
