The first goal came within just eight minutes as Chelsea took advantage of Arsenal's defensive lapses and forward into the lead after a well executed through ball by Thierry Henry, one of the key playmakers for the visiting side. "It was an unfortunate slip from our right-back that allowed him to get behind us easily," remarked Chelsea midfielder Steven Gerrard in hushed tones post match while celebrating with his teammates on field after scoring their first goal of the game, a masterful display which demonstrated Arsenal's fragile defensive set-up.

The second half began without any score from either side but things started to turn as early as minute 63 when Ian Wright found space between midfield and defense for his teammates - with one touch he sent the ball sailing past Chelsea goalkeeper, David James into an empty net which brought cheers of jubilation erupted throughout Arsenal's camp.
