Bali's New Eco Resort: A Step Forward in Sustainable Tourism? – By I Wayan Aditya and Anita Govindasamy

(Jakarta, Indonesia) - Bali has long been a top destination for luxury travelers seeking to immerse themselves in the island's rich culture. But now, Balinese entrepreneur Rama Niswati is setting her sights on changing how tourists experience this paradise by introducing an eco-resort model inspired by permaculture principles and focused on preserving Bali’s unique environment and traditions.

Nestled in the lush, terraced hills of Ubud at around 20 acres just outside Sanur Beach within Seminyak tourist area since July last year, Eco Stay aims to provide an alternative travel experience for those seeking green accommodations while visiting Bali's most famous island.

"Our resort is not about extravagance but sustainable and responsible living," said Niswati as she toured the property with CNN Indonesia last Wednesday during her exclusive interview at Eco Stay, which opened its doors to guests for check-ins from Monday this week. "We are a family that cares deeply about nature."

The resort features five handcrafted bamboo huts and two eco cottages built using recycled materials with solar power generators supplying electricity while rainwater collection systems provide water for guests' daily needs in an effort to reduce their carbon footprints. 

"I want visitors here not just as tourists but also as partners who can learn how we Balinese live," Niswati said, adding that her vision is based on the philosophy of "live simply so others can simply exist." As such, guests are invited to join activities like traditional farming or participate in local community programs while their stay.

Eco Stay'in Ubud has a 16-acre organic farm managed by Balinese locals who cultivate rice terraces and provide fresh produce for the resort’s restaurant where all ingredients come from within its own supply chain, ensuring food miles are as short as possible. Guests can also learn about traditional farming practices through scheduled walks in Ubud's terraced fields alongside local experts during their stay at Eco Stay – Niswati hopes that this will inspire guests to be more mindful of the impact they have on nature and take responsibility for preserving it after leaving Bali.

Niswati, who holds a degree in architecture from Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB) before moving back to her motherland 14 years ago where she spent six months living with local communities near Ubud's rice paddies and coffee plantations learning about traditional Balinese life styles that were sustainable for centuries, said Eco Stay was inspired by these experiences but adapted them according to modern needs.

"Balinese people have always lived in harmony with nature," Niswati explained during her tour of the resort’s farm fields where visitors can observe traditional rice and coffee plantations that operate without pesticides while preserving water sources, as per Balinese farming methods called Subak which date back to ancient times.

"We want guests here not just for relaxation but also education about our way of life," Niswati said with determination in her voice and a hopeful smile on her
