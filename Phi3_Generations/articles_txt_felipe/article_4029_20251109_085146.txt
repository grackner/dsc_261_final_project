A military coup attempt in Myanmar has led to widespinister chaos and fear among its citizens since February 1st when a faction of soldiers took control from an elected government amid economic instability and protest unrest, CNN reports on March 5th. The power struggle between the junta (military) loyalists in Myanmar's military-backed National Unity Government (NUG), which has been recognized by several countries despite international opposition to their seizure of power from a democratically elected government last year, and coup leader Senior General Min Aung Hlaing continues. The situation remains tense with reports suggesting that at least two protesters have died as a result of the ongoing unrest this week alone (March 4-5th), according to multiple local sources cited by Reuters reporters in Yangon, Myanmar's bustling commercial capital.

Min Aung Hlaing and his supporters have faced criticism for their response toward the civilian population throughout this week as they maintain control of major cities such as Naypyitaw (the country’s de facto administrative center) while military checkpoints continue to block roads, making it hard for supplies to reach more remote areas. "We fear going back because we don't know if these junta leaders are truly capable or not," said Aye Myint Kyi, a 27-year-old teacher in Yangon who teaches English as her primary skillset and has worked with underprivileged children for over five years. "They took power from the people without our consent; they just want to stay that way."

Most international sanctions imposed against Myanmar's military elite have now been frozen, which means financial transactions involving them may not be halted like other economic activities in this Southeast Asian nation. The United States and European Union previously threatened tougher measures if the junta did not relinquish power but those promises are largely unfulfilled as of late March 5th when international diplomats have been unable to gain access or establish direct communication with Min Aung Hlaing since last February's coup attempt, Reuters reports.

CNN spoke to Dr. Kyaw Oo Maung, a local political analyst who has lived in Myanmar for over 20 years and works as an associate professor of Southeast Asian Studies at the University of Yangon (also known simply by its colloquial name 'Yangon'). He believes that this junta's attempt to hold onto power is likely fueled not only due to their previous gains since November 2021 but also because they feel vulnerable after facing setbacks from international sanctions. "I think there are some factions within the military who want more control while others seem content with maintaining stability," he explained, citing that this divide could be exacerbating tensions between them and Min Aung Hlaing's forces as well.

Dr. Kyaw Oo Maung continued: "There is some fear of losing power amongst the generals." He adds about his country’s fragile situation when responding to claims that citizens are being pacified by an imposition of martial law, stating “Myanmar has suffered through decades-long military rule and many people have experienced suppression; it's hard for them not only physically but also mentally."
