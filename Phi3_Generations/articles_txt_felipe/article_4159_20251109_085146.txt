In a recent turn of events in London, authorities have announced an urgent investigation following reports of unusual weather patterns last weekend. Temperatures plunged to record lows across the city, with Sunday night temperatures dipping as low as -10°C (12°F) according to official readings from several monitoring stations around central London.

The phenomenon has left many residents shaken and prompting concerns about potential long-term effects on infrastructure if such extreme weather becomes a more common occurrence in the future due to climate change, experts warn. The Met Office – Britain's National Weather Service – confirmed that this was an unprecedent cold snap for London since records began over 30 years ago and has been named 'The Big Freeze.'

"We haven't seen anything like it in the capital before," said James Smith, a meteorologist at the Met Office. "It’s not just about discomfort – these extreme temperatures could have serious implications for public transportation systems and energy demand across the city." 

Last Saturday night (24th November), many Londoners found themselves ill-equipped to deal with such a frigid atmosphere, as reports of ice storms started emerging throughout several districts. Residents in areas close to parks were particularly vulnerable due to snowfall compounding the already low temperatures – making commutes treacherous and increasing concerns about road safety for pedestrians and cyclists alike.

The extreme cold also caused disruptions at transportation hubs, as bus services halted several times throughout Friday (23rd November) when sub-zero conditions gripped the city center tightly overnight; trains were similarly affected early on Saturday morning with delays of up to 90 minutes reported. The Mayor's Office quickly responded by providing resources for those in need, but many citizens felt that these measures may have come too late and are now demanding greater support from local government officials going forward.

"When I heard about the drop in temperature overnight last weekend - it was just mind blowing," said Emily Clarke, a lifelong Londoner living on West End Road near Regents Park who found herself shoveling snow out of her backyard Sunday morning alongside neighbors – an act that has become increasingly commonplace this winter season. "It's not every day we see temperatures like these in our city and it raises a lot of questions about how well-prepared London is for such extreme weather."

While the sudden blast of icy conditions shocked residents, experts suggest that continued investment into infrastructure could help better prepare cities across Europe to withstand future harsh winters. In response to this latest incident in London – one occurring just months after another major storm hit Paris last December causing chaos and significant damage - European weather agencies will now prioritize research around more accurate climate projections for the continent, acknowledging that such events could become increasingly frequent as global temperatures rise.

"We need to be better informed," said Dr. Alex Taylor at King's College London who has been studying environmental patterns in Europe over recent decades with a focus on extreme weather and their impact – both socially-and economically–on the continent’s major cities like Paris, Amsterdam, Berlin, etc . "The data shows us that we need to adapt our infrastructure across these metropolises as rapidly growing urban populations will be more susceptible in future if no significant measures are taken against climate change."
