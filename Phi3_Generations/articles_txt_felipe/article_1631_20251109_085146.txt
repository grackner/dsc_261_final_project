A snowstorm in New York disrupted air travel across three major hubs overnight and into Tuesday morning as more than 60 flights were canceled or delayed at LaGuardia Airport alone, CNN reports. By midday Monday (Tuesday), a total of about 250 flights had been grounded in the city's three main airports due to heavy snowfall and strong winds that have blanketed New York City since Sunday night, impacting thousands of travelers as they head home or on business.

"I was stuck at JFK for hours yesterday trying to make my flight," said Sarah Jennings from Boston who missed connecting through LaGuardia. "The delays were relentless and all flights out looked canceled."

Temperatures reached as low as 18 degrees Fahrenheit in the Big Apple, prompting Mayor Bill de Blasio to declare a snow emergency on Monday morning with parking banned within eight feet of curbs. The city's public transit system also suffered significant disruference, forcing thousands of bus drivers and subway operators off their shifts for safety reasons as the storm intensified through Sunday night into early hours Tuesday according to officials from Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA).

Airport authorities have been working around-the clock in an attempt clear snow quickly enough that passengers will be able resume travel by midday today. 500 city plows, including salt spreaders and brooms as well as contractors with specialized trucks like Zamboni machines are on standby to keep runways de-iced for takeoff readiness said Lonnie Starkey spokesman at LaGuardia airport.

"We know this is the biggest snowstorm we've seen in years, but it doesn't stop here," assured Air Traffic Controller David Keller as he monitored conditions from his control tower overlooking runways 4R/L and 13R at LaGuardia Airport. "Our priority remains passenger safety while trying to keep the flights running."

Airport officials have been monitoring weather reports closely with help coming in via satellite imagery that helped predict storm movement early Monday, giving airports enough time prepare for incoming snow as wind speeds are expected to subside by Wednesday morning according National Weather Service. 

"The biggest concern right now is safety of the travelers on the ground and our employees working here at LaGuardia Airport," explained Starkey with over a dozen other airports in New York also reporting cancellations or delays due to severe winter conditions that have been sweeping across much of North America for weeks already.

Airline representatives say they're doing everything possible under the circumstances as temperatures continue plummeting below freezing and snow shows no signs stopping soon even though it is still early February in New York City, one of five major airports operated by Port Authority overseeing LaGuardia Airport along with JFK International.

"Our top priority remains ensuring safe travels despite these extreme weather conditions," said a spokeswoman for JetBlue Airways who also shared that her company had already cancelled about 50 flights as of noon Monday, not just out of New York but across several states and even Canada.

At JFK Airport runway operations were limited early Tuesday morning due to snow-covered taxi
