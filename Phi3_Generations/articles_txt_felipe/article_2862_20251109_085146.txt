Topic: Business - After-Hours

JP Morgan Chase & Co announced a record $20 billion settlement with whistleblower Thomas Pickel in an attempt to resolve allegations of rigging currency and foreign exchange rates post-hours trading on Tuesday, October 15th. The announcement marks the first time such hefty penalties have been imposed outside regular business hours for financial misconduct since similar cases surfaced at Goldman Sachs in late December last year but were resolved before noon this week; it follows accusations of collusion and manipulation within the after-hours market.


Thomas Pickel, a former trader who accused his employer during an interview with Bloomberg News back on May 23rd of secretly influencing currency values to gain competitive advantages in unregulated off-market hours has been working for JP Morgan since September last year as part of the settlement.


"This is a very serious issue that needs immediate attention and rectification," said Michael Cheyne, CEO at JP Morgan Chase & Co during an early afternoon conference call with shareholders on Tuesday, expressing regret over Mr Pickel's actions but praising the settlement as "a decisive step towards restoring public trust."


"This was a calculated move that aimed to undermine market fairness," stated JP Morgan Chase executive Kathryn Sullivan in an interview with The Financial Times. She emphasized how this case underlines the necessity for robust checks and balances within trading markets while reassuring investors of measures being taken internally at her firm to prevent future misconducts.


"Settlement is a sign that justice has been done," said former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, adding his thoughts during an appearance on CNBC's Squawk Box East this morning (October 16th). "This case serves as both warning and assurance to all market participants."


Regulators around the world are scrutinizing after-hours trading practices following a series of allegations that shook confidence in financial markets' integrity last year. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said it was examining potential collusion within these less regulated offmarket hours, with an ongoing investigation into JP Morgan Chase & Co prompted by Pickel’s revelations.


The impact of the settlement is still unclear; however, experts predict significant changes in how after-hours trading operates moving forward as a result. "We need to adapt our systems and processes," said Dr Emily Thompson, senior analyst at financial consultancy Fiscal & Beacon on WSJ Marketplace Radio today (October 16th).


In the wake of Pickel's allegations coming forth against his former employer last month during an interview with Bloomberg News where he revealed how traders were manipulating market prices, JP Morgan Chase & Co is now faced not only with potential legal ramifications but also scrutiny from investors and regulators worldwide. The Wall Street giant's reputation had already taken a hit last year following allegations of rigging currency and foreign exchange rates within the bustling after-hours market that continues to unfold even today on October 16th, leaving some questioning where financial trust lies in an increasingly complex global landscape.
