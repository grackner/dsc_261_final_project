A magnitude-7 earthquake rocked northern Israel and southern Lebanon early Tuesday morning local time, causing significant damage but mercifully sparing loss of life as a result of the swift evacuations ordered by authorities in advance of predicted tremors from Mount Fuji. Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett expressed deepest sympathies for all those affected and announced that international aid was being sought to assist with rescue efforts, while Lebanese President Michel Aoun commended Israel’s prompt response as a reflection of the warm relationship between both nations amidst regional tensions surrounding Syria' enduring conflict. The earthquake follows closely on Monday night when Mount Fuji released energy equivalent in magnitude and aftershock activity has been felt throughout Japan, sparking concerns amongst scientists about potential impacts worldwide due to its location beneath the Pacific 'Ring of Fire'. Experts from seismological societies around the globe have offered insights into patterns indicating increased volcanic activity associated with such subterranean movements. Dr Emily Whitehouse at US Geological Survey said, "Mount Fuji’s recent shifts may well be a precursor to larger events elsewhere due in part to strain on tectonic plates from global warming-related sea level rise."

Emergency services across the region have been mobilized since tremors began just before dawn at around 3am local time with Israel and Lebanon being notably impacted. Both countries declared states of emergency, but officials in Israel were credited for their proactive evacuation plans after prior drills which some believe saved numerous lives as reported by the Jerusalem Post’s Amir Zohar: "In anticipation of potential natural calamities that may affect our country we decided to practice these procedures regularly." Shelter camps have been quickly established in safe zones throughout Israel, with a temporary home for upwards 40 individuals being set up on base at Haifa' Air Force Base.

Lebanese authorities similarly rushed relief efforts into action while avoiding panic buying of essentials which often accompanies such disasters given Lebanon’s recent history dealing with the economic impact following a deadly 2020 port explosion that was believed to be caused by negligence and corruption. The Israeli Red Cross has been at forefront since quake struck in coordinating relief efforts on behalf of its citizens, partnering closely with local authorities while international NGOs have also stepped up their support for the region’s needs through immediate deployment teams specializing primarily in emergency medical aid and disaster-trained military rescue dogs as reported by Lebanese news network Al-Mayadeen.

As scientists worldwide continue to closely monitor developments with Mt Fuji, a task force established jointly between Japan's Meteorological Agency (JMA) and the United Nations will gather this week for further assessment alongside representatives from affected nations including Israel, Lebanon as well as global seismology experts. Dr Raj Patel representing JMA says: "These are unpredictable times but through collective efforts international community can mitigate disaster risks."

Efforts have since turned towards providing temporary housing and essential services to those displaced by the earthquake, with Israeli government pledging $20 million for reconstruction aid in both countries while local communities came together offering donations of food supplies. Amid these efforts there are calls from within opposition parties such as United Arab List’s MK Mohammed
