Lead: Investors express caution ahead of key US economic reports with Dow futures down by nearly 250 points on Wednesday morning as concerns about inflation and potential interest rate hikes continue to loom large in the market's collective psyche. This turmoil is evident just days before critical financial data releases, casting a long shadow over pre-market optimism that had emerged after last month’s Federal Reserve meeting where indications of monetary tightening began seeping into investor discussions across Wall Street and beyond.


"While some stock market participants hold onto hope for positive earnings surprises, the broader economic reality check is proving to be a headwind," says Sarah Johnson, senior economist at MarketWatch Analytics.

Economists are closely monitoring Fed Chair Jerome Powell's comments at tomorrow’s press conference following today's Consumer Price Index release. The statement is highly anticipated not only by investors but also as a potential litmus test for the Federal Reserve on their policy direction in response to evolving economic conditions and inflationary trends over recent months, particularly with consumer price increases showing no signs of abating according to preliminary reports released last week.
