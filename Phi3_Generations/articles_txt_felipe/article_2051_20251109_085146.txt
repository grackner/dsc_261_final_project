A study led by a team of scientists from Yale University and published in Nature on Thursday revealed alarming consequences of rising global temperatures that could affect millions worldwide within the next decade if current trends continue unchecked. Researchers analyzed data spanning nearly two centuries, concluding with "an escalating risk for widespdest climate impacts," especially across vulnerable regions in Africa and Southeast Asia.

Affecting countries like Nigeria, Chad, South Sudan, Mali, Mozambique - the African continent is predicted to experience a significant increase of up to 2 degrees Celsius by 2035 if current policies remain unaltered according to Dr. Laura Green from Yale's Department of Earth Sciences who led this extensive study. Meanwhile, Southeast Asia could face an even greater rise - as much as three degrees in the same timeframe due to its geographical location and rapid industrial growth patterns over recent years, per Professor Hiroshi Tanaka of Tokyo University involved with data analysis for his part.

"We are at a pivotal moment where we need global action," said Dr. Green about these findings while addressing reporters during an interview on Friday morning local time in New York City - the location hosting this press conference announcing their work's publication after months of thorough research and rigorous peer review process which involved over 20 international experts from various scientific disciplines contributing to different sections related with climate model simulations, data interpretation or regional impact assessment.

Accordingly governments must adopt policies promoting renewable energy sources while reducing dependence on fossil fuels - a call echoed by world leaders attending COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh last month where an agreement to do more was made but not fully honored, notes Dr Thompson at Climate Action Network International based here who has followed these developments closely over time through years of activism working alongside affected communities.

This alarming study comes against a backdrop that already sees millions displaced due largely anthropogenic activities causing greenhouse gas emissions - thus exacerbating climate instability leading to erratic weather patterns characterized by intensified hurricanes, floods and droughts seen increasingly affect vulnerable regions around globe more severely.

However experts like Professor Tanaka remain hopeful amidst these grim findings stressing the urgency for governments worldwide not just implementing but strictly enforcing policies aimed at mitigating climate change impact such as phasing out coal plants completely within 30 years while investing heavily into clean energy infrastructure developments alongside robust adaptation measures like improved water resource management techniques, efficient agricultural practices etc..

"These alarming findings should serve only to motivate all countries present at this COP27 meeting and beyond," said Dr Thompson urging global cooperation as a necessity while adding he remains cautiously optimistic about the progress being made thus far - with tangible results yet elusive but signs promising change visible.

As world leaders continue negotiations here until November 15th, next steps are expected from this pivotal climate summit to finalize an ambitious plan of action which includes concrete commitments towards reaching net-zero emissions by mid-century as agreed upon during COP26 last year while acknowledging existing disparities between countries particularly in terms technological capacity or funding availability that might hamper progress - all pointing out more than ever before the need
