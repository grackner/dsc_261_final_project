After a devastating earthquake struck Nepal on Saturday morning, survivors of Lukla airport in the Langtang region are beginning to rebuild their community amidst overwhelming international aid pouring into this mountain town tucked among Himalayan peaks. The 7.8 magnitude quake triggered landslides that closed down treacherous access roads, leaving hundreds stranded for days before relief efforts began rolling in.

As of Monday afternoon, reports indicate the death toll has risen to at least 30 with many more feared missing as rescue operations continue into their second week amid freezing nights and daytime temperatures often reaching over 25 degrees Celsius during midday hours that lead into evenings. Nearly all of Lukla's small airport infrastructure was damaged, forcing helicopters to become the primary mode for relief delivery as aid organizations strive towards reestablishing supply lines and getting locals back on their feet through various programs aimed at reconstruction efforts which they hope will begin within a month.

"This is going to take time - we're just thankful that everyone involved has been working so tirelessly," said community leader Rishi Khadka, who oversaw evacuation logistics when the earthquake hit while standing outside his home along with several others from which only partial walls remain now propped up by wooden sticks and cables.

Nepalese officials estimate that between 150 million to 300 million dollars worth of infrastructure has been destroyed, but international aid groups have pledged over half a billion dollars in donations for relief efforts across multiple fronts from the ground up after days passing without electricity or communication links since initial quake impact when landslides caused damage deep within Langtang itself. UNICEF Nepal Country Director Lotta Sylwander said that although it's too early to comment on specific projects, a range of activities are planned throughout this year including emergency cash grants for affected families and providing psychosocial support services as needed after trauma caused by loss within their community at large where people have lost loved ones themselves in addition to losing property along with livelihood assets like farmlands that they may rely on going forward.

"We are working closely with the Nepalese government agencies, local communities and partners already there now providing food assistance as well," said Sylwander who arrived this morning by helicopter accompanied by her team from UNICEF along side representatives of other international aid organizations such as CARE International whose experts plan to help rebuild homes using innovative methods like prefabricated modular units. "Our priority is always the safety and wellbeing, we know that families are going through a really difficult time right now."

Meanwhile in Kathmandu located some 30 kilometers away from where Langtang lies within far-flung mountainous terrains of Nepal's third largest city still feels like home for many who had made it their temporary base after the earthquake hit early Saturday morning. Tens more thousands evacuated have been staying here while doctors and relief experts work around nonstop 24/7 to ensure all needs are met even as they face challenges coordinating efforts due mainly because multiple international organizations working concurrently with different priorities that sometimes collide when it comes down deciding where best resources should be put for maximum impact in terms of speedy recovery among other
