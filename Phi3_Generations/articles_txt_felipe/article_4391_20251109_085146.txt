In a Sunday night game that turned into something of an unprecedented spectacle in NFL history, two quarterback star players from rival teams found themselves embroiled in controversy over comments made on social media regarding the other' end-of-year championship matchup and their potential impact on fans. Atlanta Falcons signal caller Matt Ryan had a few choice words about Baltimore Ravens starting QB Lamar Jackson after watching him perform brilliantly during Monday night’s AFC Championship game, while Mr. Vandemeer from the New England Patriots expressed his admiration for how well he believes Seattle Seahawks' Russell Wilson has been playing lately as compared to Falcons star Calvin Ridley in a viral tweet earlier this week that is now making waves throughout NFL circles on Sunday evening.

The unexpected exchange between the two quarterbacks, which began with comments made by Mr. Vandemeer about how well Lamar Jackson had been playing for Baltimore before he started to boast his own performance and prowess against Atlanta's Matt Ryan took him there, has NFL insiders fuming as it appears these statements could sow division between fans of both teams going into Super Bowl XLVI next week. This incident is one that the league will surely watch closely for signs of escalation in future games with similar dynamics or situations arising from such confrontations by players and management, not only affecting player camaraderie but also fan loyalty as well - a ripple effect NFL officials fear could impact ticket sales to big-game weekends across the country if left unchecked.

In light of these incidents in professional football where on-field action has been overshadowed by social media confrontations, sources close to both teams tell CNN they hope for less animosity between players and fans as rivalry games continue but acknowledge that sometimes tensions can boil over into disruptive behavior. NFL leadership is currently reviewing league policies around player conduct on personal platforms with an eye toward potential revisions if needed since last season saw several high-profile cases of confrontations during play leading to both disciplinary actions and fines imposed by the commissioner's office – something they do not want repeated in this new era where social media plays such a big role outside game time hours.

Baltimore Ravens Head Coach Mike McCarthy said, “We have been very careful about what players say on their personal channels and as soon as I saw Matt Ryan’s comment yesterday evening that referenced Lamar Jackson - even if he meant it in jest – we knew something wasn't right. This is unacceptable behavior from our fellow competitors at the highest level, which can only hurt everyone involved.” Atlanta Falcons Coach Arthur Smith concurred: “Matt Ryan’s comments yesterday have crossed a line for us and there are no excuses or justifications to make after seeing how divisive it was towards both Baltimore fans & Ravens Nation - something we hold dear. While I understand Mr. Vandemeer made light of his own accomplishments against Atlanta, calling out Matt Ryan’s skill level is simply inappropriate and not representative who we are as professional athletes trying to play our best each week.”

NFL President Tom Curran added: “It's crucial that players understand the impact their words can have on others beyond themselves - both within team dynamics but also how they reflect back onto us fans. We all share a love for football and respect must continue amongst competitors as well, or there is nothing left of it really."
