In a surprising twist of fate on Saturday night at Madison Square Garden in New York City, professional ice hockey player Alex Turner collapsed during Game 46 between his hometown team and the rival New Jersey Devils due to an unexpected medical emergency. The incident prompted immediate action from both teams and health officials alike as they rushed onto the ice with first aid kits in hand following a frantic appeal for assistance just minutes before, reports CNN on Wednesday 

The seasoned veteran had made his way into the game after recovering from minor injuries sustained during last weekend's match against Detroit Red Wings when he was caught off guard by this sudden turn of events. The crowd fell silent as a medical team swarmed around him, with Devils forward Sam Jenkins saying to CNN sports correspondent Sarah Johnson at the time: "I couldn't believe my eyes. One minute Alex is here shaking hands and joking about his past matchups against our teams; he was fine just ten minutes ago."
 
Turner's collapse led referee John Davies, who has been officiating games between these two sides for over twenty years now that they face off again in New York City this weekend. "I don’t remember a similar incident ever happening before," said Davis after witnessing firsthand how his teammates rushed to help their fellow player once he collapsed on the ice at 7:30 pm ET last Saturday night against Devils' star goaltender Peter Russoffsky. "It was chaotic for a few minutes there, but I’ve seen better comebacks."
 
The league has yet to comment officially about this incident beyond their initial statement that they are reviewing the situation and seeking more information from related parties like teams' trainers or medical staff before releasing further statements regarding what transpired. However in an interview with ESPN on Tuesday, Devils head coach Michael Benson said: "It was a scary moment for sure – Alex isn’t used to having his body fail him during play."
 
Benson expressed relief that Turner's condition seemed stable and promised all necessary follow-ups were being arranged by medical professionals involved in the incident. Devils assistant coach, Steve Thompson added: "As a team we came together as one after this happened – Alex’s family is doing better now too." He then mentioned how everyone hopes for full recovery soon so that Turner can get back on ice to continue his passion - hockey which he has played professionally since 1975.

The game resumed an hour later, with both teams determined not let the incident hamper their efforts as fans filled up Madison Square Garden once again cheering for victory and sportsmanship over rivalry – a testament to how deeply sports can unite people regardless of circumstance; something that players like Alex Turner understand well after experiencing first-hand what it truly means when life throws curveballs at you while playing one's favorite game.
