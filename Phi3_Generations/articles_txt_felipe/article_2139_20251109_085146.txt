As stock markets worldwide continued their late trading session into Tuesday night, tech giants Apple and Amazon found themselves embroiled in a corporate espionage scandal that sent shockwaves across Wall Street this weekend (March 30th). Both companies reported unusual activity over the past few days leading to suspicions of insider trading.

Apple, which has traditionally been known for its innovation and market dominance in consumer electronics since Steve Jobs' era, saw a mysterious dip in stock price last Friday evening (March 27th), followed by an unexpected surge on Saturday before dropping again early this morning. Amazon had similar fluctuations but with different timing compared to Apple which has been the market leader for decades following Jeff Bezos' leadership since the company’ endorsement in 1994 until his resignation as CEO last year and re-emergence on a cloud computing role starting this month.

A recent report from Bloomberg, cites anonymous sources who allege that employees with access to sensitive information at both firms exploited the after-hours trading window for financial gain by selling their shares based on confidential news about planned strategic changes and acquisitions in each company's pipeline.

Amazon's CEO, Jeff Bezos had not made any official statement as yet. However he posted a brief tweet early this morning about looking forward to sharing more exciting plans for the company soon: "Had an amazing time in Europe last night! Looking ahead to even bigger news tomorrow."

Experts warn that such activities could have long term consequences for the integrity of stock market operations globally while calling upon executives to take immediate actions against potential insider trading and safeguarding sensitive information internally:
"This is a serious concern, as not only investors are impacted but our financial systems' credibility too. Companies must act swiftly before such issues escalate," stated John Smith, Professor of Finance at New York University Stern School of Business in an interview with CNNMoney News Channel today (April 1st).

The SEC has called upon Apple and Amazon to cooperate fully on its investigation. The tech industry giants are expected to provide detailed records for after-hours trading activities from last weekend leading up till this morning, as per the officials involved with these proceedings today: "We've initiated a preliminary inquiry into several reports of questionable stock sales in Apple and Amazon shares. We urge them to comply fully."

The SEC did not reveal details about who might be implicated or when they can expect conclusions from their investigation, but insiders have hinted at potential involvement from within both firms' upper management level which could lead to criminal charges if enough evidence is found. Meanwhile, the aftershock of this scandal continues in a market that has already seen significant losses for investors as news spreads and anx
