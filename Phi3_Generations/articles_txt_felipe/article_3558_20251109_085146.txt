A new study on physical activity levels released by experts from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health today indicates that Americans are not getting enough exercise to maintain good health standards and prevent chronic diseases like obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. The comprehensive analysis conducted over the past year included data gathered through surveys completed between March 2021-February 2influence of COVID restrictions on physical activity patterns in urban communities was a key focus of this study which involved researchers from New York City, Boston, Philadelphia and Chicago working together to pool resources.

The report found that about only one quarter (37%) met the recommended guidelines for weekly exercise by adults aged 18-64 years — at least two hours plus thirty minutes of moderate physical activity a week or an equivalent amount of vigorous activities such as jogging and running. Children below age twelve showed better adherence to fitness regimes with approximately one third (32%) meeting the guideline, compared to just 19% in adults aged above sixteen years old — notably lower than other countries surveyed which typically exhibit higher exercise rates among young people of this demographic.

"Physical activity is crucial for overall wellness and plays a major role in preventing chronic illnesses," said lead researcher Dr Susan Johnson, Professor at the School's Department of Healthcare Policy & Research who noted that lackadaisically high levels can also increase risk factors associated with injuries.

Dr Johnson pointed out various reasons for America's poor physical fitness rankings such as limited access to recreational areas or safe neighborhood streets where people feel comfortable walking, running and biking – an issue exacerbated by recent urban development projects favoring commercial interests over public spaces like parks & greenways.
 
Furthermore, she highlighted concerns about socio-economic factors contributing to disparities in fitness levels across different regions within the country with lower income communities often facing even more obstacles due their geographic location and limited resources dedicated towards promoting healthy lifestyles among residents. "We cannot overlook how these systemic issues affect people's ability to lead an active life," she added while acknowledging efforts made by community-based initiatives providing affordable fitness facilities, free outdoor exercise programs in public parks during weekends as examples of grassro01y movements aimed at improving physical activity levels within disadvantaged communities.

City officials from New York and Boston have expressed their commitment to making changes towards encouraging healthier lifestyles among citizens by allocating more fundings for safe sidewalks, bike lanes along bus routes; opening up public spaces during non-peak hours as well introducing citywide events promoting sports participation amongst youth. Mayor Bill DeBlasio stated that "New York City is taking steps towards creating a healthier future by improving walkability and bicycle infrastructure across the five boroughs".

Public health experts argue for broader changes beyond just local governments, advocating policies like workplace wellness programs encouraging employees to take breaks throughout their day apart from promoting active transportation methods such as walking or cycling instead of driving alone whenever possible. Additionally, researchers suggest that increased public awareness campaigns about health risks related with sedentary lifestyles coupled with regular screenings for high blood pressure and cholesterol can go a long way towards motivating individuals to eng
