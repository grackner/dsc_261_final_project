A series of mysterious fires have broken out across various national parks in New South Wales on Friday night. Firefiginfluenza-fueled evacutions took place as authorities struggled to contain the flames that spread rapidly due to extreme heat and dry conditions associated with an intense flu season throughout Australia's East Coast region, reports CNN Australian Bureau Chief Michael Matheson in Sydney.

Authorities reported more than 30 incidents of unexplained fires on Friday alone; many have since been deemed arson-related as investigators continue to look into the cause behind a spate of deliberately set blazes amidst concerns about increasing instances of hoax calls linked with flu season, according to local news agencies.

"We've seen an alarming increase in suspected fraudulent callers who are trying to deceive and disrupt emergency services," said Acting Commissioner David Morris during a press conference on Friday evening. "Our priority is to protect the community, which means addressing these hoax calls."

Morris continued: “We understand that this situation may cause panic among some people who believe there's an imminent danger of fire outbreaks due to misinformation circulating online and phone communications.” The Fire Brigade Command has been working closely with law enforcement agencies, including the NSW Crime Commission (NSWCC), investigating these hoax calls linked as part of a broader pattern seen across several regions throughout Australia.

The spate of deliberately set fires occurred primarily in rural and national park areas such as Kangaroo Valley National Park near Wollongong, Morton Bay National Park between Brisbane Airport and Moreton Island; Kosciuszko National Park to the South West towards Canberra city center.

Firefiginfluenza-related concerns also led authorities to issue a high alert for bushfires as they intensified their efforts alongside local volunteers due to forecasted hot weather, with temperatures expected above 35°C throughout Friday and into Saturday mornings in these locations. The NSWCC stated that the hoax calls coincided with an increase of around three-fold during this time compared to non-flu season periods when such incidents were rare.

According to recent data from Australia's Bureau of Meteorology, temperatures have been above average for months now across most parts of Queensland and New South Wales due in part to climate change effects like more frequent La Niña events; a phenomenon characterized by cooler ocean waters which lead hotter air into land-masses causing drought conditions as seen during this year's flu season peak.

The NSWCC is appealing for the public’s assistance and urging everyone not to be complacent about their safety, warning: "Don't take these calls at face value; always call back when asked so we can verify authenticity before deploying resources." The Commissioner noted that while most hoaxers were found innocent after investigation into actual legitimate emergency situations unfolded during the hot days ahead.

A local volunteer firefighter, James McLaughlin from Wollongong stated: “We're doing our best to keep people safe amid these challenging circumstances; we have a dedicated team working round-the-clock.” 

With an estimated cost of AUD $20 million for extinguishing the fires thus far and disruptions caused by hoax calls on emergency services, NSWCC Chairman Chris Cunneen
