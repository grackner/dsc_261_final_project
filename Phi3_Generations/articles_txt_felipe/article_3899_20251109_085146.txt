A massive iceberg measuring nearly a square mile in area has broken away from Antarctica's Larsen C Ice Shelf into the Weddell Sea following years of thinning and warming ocean waters around it, scientists say. This calving event occurred on April 12th near Concordia Base at about latitude -76 degrees south where researchers have been monitoring ice melt with satellite imagery since September 2020 when the shelf was still intact before fracturing into two halves earlier this year, according to glaciologists from Project MIDAS. The once-million cubic foot behemoth is now drifting at a pace of about five miles per day toward South Atlantic waters as temperatures continue rising due to climate change—a process that's been underway for decades and shows no sign of slowing down, say experts."We are witnessing an unprecedin
