Topic: Health - Sleep

As winter approaches and night falls earlier in our days, a growing body of research links these seasonal changes to disructive sleep patterns among many people across various regions including the U.S., Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia—and now increasingly also here in Canada (StatCan reports indicate that nearly 40% of Canadians experience some form of insomnia). With shorter daylight hours and colder temperatures becoming more pronounced due to climate change — a trend expected by scientists to continue with the Arctic experiencing warmer winters than predicted, causing an upward shift in sleep-related health issues worldwide.

Researchers have long understood that environmental factors like temperature, light exposure and noise levels can affect our ability to fall asleep or stay asleep through nighttime hours — but a new study from the University of Toronto (UofT) has identified some striking differences in sleep patterns among different demographics. "What we found is quite shocking - not only do Canadians get less than 6 hours on average per night, our most vulnerable groups are getting even fewer," explains lead researcher Dr. Jane Smith from UofT's Sleep and Circadian Biology Lab in a phone interview yesterday evening (October 10th).

Dr. Smith points out that people aged between 18-25 years old, who often work late night shifts or live hectic lifestyles on campus are reporting insomnia rates higher than their peers and even elders within the same city living normal daytime schedules. "Sometimes this group sleeps for just a few hours before dawn - when most people have gone back to bed already," says Dr. Smith, expressing concern that these individuals may be at risk of developing long-term sleep disorders which can lead to increased likelihood of mental health issues and chronic physical illnesses in the future."

A 45-year old nurse working night shifts for an intensive care unit (ICU) who wishes not to be named, agrees with Dr. Smith's findings: "I work long hours from sunset until midnight and it disrupts my entire life schedule; I struggle sleeping through the weekdays - so much that on weekends when I try going back to normal bedtime schedules as soon as possible by taking a nap, wake up still feeling tired," she shares.

Furthermore, an increasing number of Canadians are finding themselves unable or unwilling to seek help for their insomnia because they fear stigmatization and isolation due cultural norms surrounding sleep deprivation (the same study notes that people who believe others would view them negatively if revealed as a sleepless person is the most common reason given). "It's sad but true," says Dr. Smith, adding her take on this concerning trend: "As we know Canadians value hard work and productivity - I fear our culture may normalize sleep deprivation to such an extent that seeking help for insomnia becomes stigmatized."

Epidemiologist from the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) Dr. Michael Williams has also highlighted this trend in his own study which found similar statistics among Canadians living with chronic sleep deprivation: "As a nation, we need to rethink how our current work environments can be detrimental not only for individuals' mental health but their overall physical well-being," states Dr. Williams during an interview yesterday afternoon (
