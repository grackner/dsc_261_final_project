On Tuesday afternoon in New York City, a start-up accelerator named 'Innovate Now' launched an ambitious new investment fund aimed at supporting tech entrepreneurs from underrepresented backgrounds as they bring their cutting-edge ideas to life. At the historic Grand Central Station event attended by local dignitarty and prominent industry figures, 20 young business leaders were announced as participants in this one-of-a-kind initiative, which has received over $15 million from private investors within its first month of operation.


"We believe that every entrepreneurial dream deserves a fair shot at success," said John Carter, CEO of 'Innovate Now.' "The tech industry is bursting with potential and creativity — it's time to diversify the voices shaping our future." 


Carter highlighted how this fund stands out by actively seeking founders who identify as members from traditionally marginalized groups, such as women of color or LGBTQ+ individuals. These entrepreneurs are provided with not only capital but also mentorship and networking opportunities aiming to level the playing field in tech startup investments where historically underrepresented voices have been disproportionately excluded from success stories, such as those of Steve Jobs or Mark Zuckerberg.


Amanda Lee, one of three women featured among this year's participants and founder of a fintech application designed to help small businesses manage their expenses more efficiently, shared her experiences: "I had the opportunity not only to secure funding but also access mentors who have navigated similar challenges. 'Innovate Now' is about building an inclusive tech community that reflects our diverse society."


Experts are weighing in on this promising development, with Professor Susan Rodriguez from New York University Stern School of Business stating: "It’s a positive step forward for the business world to recognize and fund underrepresented entrepreneurs. The potential innovation benefits that will come out of initiatives like these are immeasurable."


As 'Innovate Now' continues its mission, more founders from diverse backgrounds hope this program can serve as a template for similar accelerators nationwide to ensure all voices in the business world have equal opportunity.
