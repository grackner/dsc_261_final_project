Nearly every adult in America recognizes that sleep is vital for good health and well-being — yet a new study by leading experts at Johns Hopkins University has found alarmingly high levels of chronic insomnia within the population, particularly among those aged between 45 to 60 years old.

Researchers from their Sleep Disorders Center conducted extensive surveys and clinical examinations on participants across several urban areas in Washington D.C., Baltimore, Virginia Cityscape, New York Metropolis, Los Angeles County, San Francisco Bay Area, Chicago metropolitan region, Boston, Phoenix Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), Atlanta MSA, Houston-The Woodlands Metro area and Dallas Fort Worth metroplex — all within the last year.

"It's clear that insomnia has become a widespread public health concern," says Dr. Laura Henson, lead researcher at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine Sleep Disorders Center (SDC). "We found about 30% to nearly half the people within our age group sample struggle with chronic sleep issues."

The study suggests several factors that may contribute to this high prevalence: stress, mental health problems like anxiety and depression; lifestyle choices such as overwork or sedentary habits along with a lack of sunlight exposure during winter months. Furthermore, some individuals in the survey reported sleep disruptions due to environmental factors like noise pollution or suboptimal bedroom temperatures.

Participants were asked about their nightly routines and experiences while resting; 70% revealed they engage regularly with electronic devices for hours before attempting to go to sleep, a habit that may delay the onset of deeper stages needed for healthy slumber according to Dr. Henson: "The blue light emitted from screens inhibits melatonin production which can disrupt our body clock and interfere with quality rest."

"Many people don't realize how much technology affects their ability to fall asleep, but we consistently see that this impact is significant," Henson continues. "People must make a concerted effort not only on reducing screen time before bedtime but also finding other relaxation techniques like reading physical books or meditation."

Chronic insomnia can lead to long-term health problems including heart disease, diabetes and even early mortality according to the National Sleep Foundation. Yet despite these well-documented risks of sleeplessness — some experts argue that societal pressures around productivity could be a contributing factor since more working hours can exacerbate exhaustion at bedtime.

Sarah Thompson, an employee in the tech industry and one among several study participants who suffer from chronic insomnia, shares her experience: "Work demands are high these days — sometimes I work late into nights then end up scrolling through social media as a way to unwind." Inspired by this finding, healthcare providers plan on offering education around sleep hygiene and relaxation techniques in the future.

The researchers aim for their findings to influence policy changes that can address contributing factors like work-life balance while advocating individuals take better care of themselves through informed habits about managing stress levels or optimizing daily routines: "Our study should serve as a wakeup call not only at the societal but also individual level."

Dr. Laura Henson concludes with an encouraging statement for
