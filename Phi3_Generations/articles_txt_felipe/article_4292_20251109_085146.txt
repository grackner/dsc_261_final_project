Nearby hospitals report increased stress levels as pandemic continues; mindfulness programs gaining traction among healthcare workers in Boston over past year | CNN Health & Science News | cnn.com

By Sarah Thompson, Special to the DailyMailWednesday, November 12th - As COVID-19 cases continue to rise throughout Massachusetts, local hospitals are not only grappling with a surge of patients but also facing an uptick in stress and burnout among their staff. In response, mindfulness training programs have been steadily introduced within healthcare settings across Boston over the past year as institutions seek effective ways to support frontline workers' well-being during these trying times.

"The last twelve months haven't gotten any easier on our team at St. Mary’s Hospital," says Dr. Emily Roberts, who has worked in emergency care for fifteen years before becoming one of the hospital administrators involved with implementing mindfulness techniques among staff members over a year ago when they noticed an increase in anxiety and stress-related issues within their ranks. "The pandemic's relentless pace continues to impact our workforce, but I believe that by incorporating these simple tools into daily routines could help us navigate the challenges we face together."

Dr. Roberts was one of several Boston healthcare providers who started mindfulness training programs for their staff in an attempt at improving mental wellbeing amidst a global crisis, which has been found to have devastating effects on communities across every sector since early 2020 when the pandemic began sweeping through nations. Mindful meditation practices not only help reduce stress but also promote better sleep and increased resilience against adversity among individuals by fostering an awareness of one's thoughts, emotions, sensations, and actions in any given moment without judgment or attachment to them - skills vital for healthcare professionals serving on the frontlines battling COVID-19.

"Mindfulness isn't just about sitting quietly with your eyes closed," says Dr. Peter Kim, a psychiatrist based at Massachusetts General Hospital who leads mindfulness workshops throughout Boston and its surrounding areas for hospital staff members as well as individuals seeking support themselves through private sessions or in group settings within their community spaces such as libraries or parks."Mindful practices empower us to navigate life's challenges with compassion, grounding ourselves amidst chaos. Mindful awareness can make all the difference when facing hardship; it allows you to recognize what your body needs and respond appropriately rather than react impulsively or emotionally."

Since implementing mindfulness programs among its staff members a year ago at St Mary's Hospital, reports from administrators indicate that there has been an overall reduction in employee turnover rates by 18% while job satisfaction levels have also increased since the initiative began. These findings were confirmed through anonymous surveys conducted within several other hospitals across Boston following suit with similar efforts made elsewhere nationwide to provide a holistic approach towards treating physical as well as emotional aspects of health during this pandemic year, one marked by unprecedented levels of fear and uncertainty for so many people.

Ms Elizabeth Wallace, an emergency room nurse at Boston's North Station Hospital who completed mindfulness training six months ago after noticing how it helped cope with difficult situations while working in trauma care during COVID-19 surges adds to the testimony
