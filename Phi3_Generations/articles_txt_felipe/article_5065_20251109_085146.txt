In a remarkable move towards promoting sustainable tourism and regional culture through food, Chef Emily Rivera has announced her new culinary destination in Tuscany for the next fall season starting on September 15th. This exclusive partnership with local vineyards will offer travelers not just scenic views but also an unforgettable dining experience featuring a modern take on traditional Italian cuisine, focusing heavily on organic wines and farm-to-table produce sourced within driving distance of Florence, the heart of Tuscany.

Emily Rivera’s venture was revealed during her visit to La Vite'Sale—an innovative winery known for blending ancient grape varietals with organic farming practices since its establishment in 2015 by Michelin-starred Pasquale Russo. The collaboration, which has been under discussion over the last three months, will see travelers embarking on a culinary journey that spans multiple vineyards within Tuscany's wine country.

"Travel is about immersion and connection—not just to place but also culture," says Emily Rivera in her promotional video for the fall season, released last Thursday at La Vite'Sale during a charity dinner celebrating their latest vintage of Chianti Classico. "I want our guests not only to taste incredible food that tells Tuscany’s story but also feel they are becoming part of it.”

The guest experience, which will run from September 15th through November 30th and accommodates up to fifty travelers per night on a five-night stay, promises an escape into authentic Italian life where guests participate in vineyard tours before sitting down for the dinner served by Rivera. As part of her commitment to sustainability, Emily ensures that all dishes include locally sourced organic ingredients and are seasonally appropriate—even if they involve unconventional local flavors like Tuscan chanterelle mushrooms or aged Balsamico di Modena.

One of the guests who attended a recent tasting session shared her thoughts on Rivera’s vision, "Emily's approach is refreshing—it makes you taste more keenly and appreciate not just flavors but also traditions that go into them." The collaboration between chef Emily Rivera and Michelin-starred Pasquale Russo underscs the growing trend of gastronomic tourism, where food becomes a gateway to cultural immersion. 

Experts on travel suggest that culinary experiences like these could become more common as destinations vie for attention in an increasingly saturated market—especially within regions known for their rich cuisine and agricultural heritage such as Tuscany, Italy’s wine-growing heartland. Travel industry analyst Luca Bianchi commented on the rising popularity of localized gastronomy: “Gastro tourism is growing because people want more authentic experiences that connect them deeply to a place's culture and history."

Rivera, who earned her stripes by working with renowned chef Massimo Batali before opening her Tuscany-based restaurant in New York City last year, brings an unparalleled expertise at integrating regional dishes into modern culinary narratives. Rivera’s newest project comes on the heels of a successful run that attracted not
