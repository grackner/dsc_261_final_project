Amid escalating tensions in Hong Kong as protesters rally for democratic reforms and Beijing stands firm on its "one country, two systems" policy, the United Nations has decided to send a high-level envoy to China this month with an aim of facilitating dialogue between pro-democracy activists and Chinese officials. The UN resolution was passed yesterday after weeks of discussions among member states concerned about potential violations of human rights in Hong Kong as political unrest continues.

In March 2021, UN Secretary-General António Guterres expressed his concern about the situation unfolding in the Special Administrative Region of China. The SAR's chief executive Carrie Lam has been widely criticized for allegedly using police brutality to quell protesters advocating more transparency and democracy since 2019, a year marked by massive demonstrations against Beijing’s attempts at imposing greater political control over the city.

The United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC), which currently holds its session in Geneva on human rights issues around the world including Hong Kong's democratic movement, had already raised concerns several times during previous sessions of this year that Beijing’s sweeping national security law has cast a long shadow over basic freedoms and political reform efforts within the city. The UNHRC then adopted resolution on September 5 to dispatch an envoy after weeks-long discussions among member states, which called for dialogue aimed at promoting democracy in Hong Kong while respecting China’s sovereignty over its SAR.

Ms. Zhang's mission will begin this month and she is expected to meet with Beijing officials as well as representatives from civil society organizations, human rights groups, academic institutions, and professional associations based in Hong Kong for consultations about ways forward on the future of democracy while promoting peaceful coexistence. She has a history of working closely with government leaders including President Xi Jinping during her time at UN Development Programme where she served as Assistant Director-General for Africa from 2014 to August this year before taking up position in Geneva.

“I look forward not only discussing democratic reforms and human rights, but also ways we can promote more open dialogue between pro-democracy activists across Hong Kong while respecting Beijing’s sovereignty,” Ms. Zhang told reporters today as she arrived in China after completing a trip to mainland Chinese cities that included Tianjin and Shanghai, where she visited government offices for talks with officials responsible for human rights issues including Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of National People’s Congress Liu Hongcai. 

“The world needs more dialogue not only on ground but online as well,” added Ms. Zhang who expects to visit democracy advocates in various corners across China while touring Beijing, Xinjiang and Tibet this week for talks with relevant officials including Vice President Liu Dongdeng of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Central Committee’s Discipline Inspection Commission.
