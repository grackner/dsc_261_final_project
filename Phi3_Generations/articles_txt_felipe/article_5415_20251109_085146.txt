"Atlanta Braves' star pitcher Mike Foltynewicz was suspended for violating MLB's drug policy last night in Miami," reports CNN Sports Journalist David Smith. The incident occurred during the All-Star break as part of a routine doping control test mandated by Major League Baseball (MLB).

"After extensive investigations and consultations with medical professionals, Foltynewicz was found to have violated MLB's policy on performance-enhancing drugs," said Dr. Samantha Greenfield, an expert in sports medicine who spoke exclusively to CNN from her office at the University of Georgia Medical Center.

The 30-year-curveballer has been with the Braves since joining as a first-round pick out of South Dakota State College back in 2015 and was considered one of MLB's top prospects for several years before making his debut on July 8, 2017. His career statistics have included an impressive win rate with a record of 43 wins against just 9 losses throughout the season so far; however, this latest revelation is casting a shadow over Foltynewicz's accomplishments in baseball.

MLB Deputy Commissioner Dan Hittington commented on the case during yesterday's press conference saying, "We are deeply disappointed to see that someone as talented and promising as Mike has chosen not to comply with our policy." The All-Star break is an important time for players where they get a chance to rest while also participating in exhibition games. This suspension will be served during the Braves' offseason, which typically runs from December 15th through February first when teams are given significant downtime before their spring training commences on March 20th and regular season resumes with Opening Day a month later on April 4th in Atlanta.

Foltynewicz was immediately placed under the league's personal catcher, who has spent extensive time working together for over four seasons now, while also providing counsel to him about his future in baseball if he chooses not to take anti-doping measures seriously moving forward from this incident onwards. Foltynewicz himself said during a press conference yesterday afternoon: "I am deeply sorry that I made the mistake of misusing performance enhancing substances, and for betraying my teammates' trust." He went onto say he is ready to take full responsibility over his actions which could not only cost him this season but also damage any future career aspirations within baseball.

Braves owner Liberty Media has been swift in their response with a statement saying, "We stand by our players and believe that they are dedicated athletes who comply with all rules of the game as well as personal morals." The Braves have yet to decide on Foltynewicz's future status within Atlanta. As for fans expressing their reactions towards this disappointing news; a fan club president stated, "As baseball enthusiasts ourselves, we understand that players are human beings and mistakes can happen but the key lies in learning from those errors."

Sources close to Foltynewicz confirm he is planning on seeking therapy as part of his rehabilitation for both himself mentally and physically. Meanwhile fans await with bated breath whether or not this once promising young pitcher will have a chance at being forgiven by the Atlanta Braves community through their decision in due time after Foltynewicz's suspension is completed
