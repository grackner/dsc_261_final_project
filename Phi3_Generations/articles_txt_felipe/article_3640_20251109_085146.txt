**Solution:** 

March 31st saw a notable rise in pre-market activity as the world’s stock markets gear up to reopen after weeks of shutdown due to concerns over health issues, economic downturns and uncertainty. According to market analytics firm TradeTech, early trading indicators show that sectors like technology (with companies such as Apple, Amazon, Alphabet), followed by industrials are setting the tone for a potentially active session tomorrow. 

“This pre-market activity is quite significant compared with previous days when markets have been closed,” said John Doe, an equity research analyst at MarketWatch Analytics. "We're witnessing major tech companies pushing their shares higher.” He further noted that while some sectors are performing better than others, the overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic despite lingering uncertainties about global economic recovery post-COVID."

Meanwhile, several European and American firms have already reported earnings from last quarter. For instance, IBM's (IBM) revenue increased by 7% in the fiscal first quarter while its net income rose to $4.3 billion. Conversely, Netflix saw a drop of about 9% in subscribers during COVID lockdowns but reported an increase this week as more services are returning across regions worldwide.

However, experts warn investors not to overlook the volatile nature of markets amid ongoing global crises and recovery efforts. While it's too early to predict what tomorrow’s session holds for individual stocks or sectors, analysts maintain a watchful eye as financial activities gradually resume from their hiatus due to COVID-19 pandemic concerns at the start of this month.

Tom Hanks, CEO of major technology firm TechGlobal Inc., says that while they are eager for business operations to get back on track after months in lockdown, company executives maintain a cautious approach towards reopening amidst evolving COVID-19 cases globally and potential economic impacts.

The next step includes more firms stepping forward with their earnings reports tomorrow as the pre-market session continues to pick up pace throughout today's trading day, which will provide investors a clearer picture of how major companies are positioned for reopening amidst recovery efforts and economic uncertainties.
