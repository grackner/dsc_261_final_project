A massive travel bubble is set to launch in Tokyo this summer as a unique experiment aimed at reviving domestic tourism and alleviating some of the economic impact brought by pandemic-induced border restrictions worldwide. Japan's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism announced last Thursday that select prefectures including Kyoto, Okinawa, Nagano, Osaka, Hokkaido, Fukuoka, Kanazawa, Okayama, Shiga, and Toyama will participate in the trial bubble. The program is scheduled to begin on June 15th when travelers from within these regions can visit Tokyo without going through additional screening measures or quarantine protocols that are currently mandatory for visitors coming from abroad due to COVID-19 fears, as per sources familiar with Japan'in plans but who were not authorized to speak publicly about it.

"Tourism is one of our pillars in terms of economic growth," said Hiroshi Nishikawa, an official at the Ministry of Land and Tourism (MLIT). "We hope that this initiative will provide a safe space for travelers while also generating new momentum within Japan's domestic tourism industry." The bubble model has been tested in places like New Zealand, Australia, Thailand, Singapore, and Iceland. In those countries, certain regions are designated as 'travel corridors,' allowing residents of other areas to move freely between them with minimal restrictions on entry or exit procedures—provided that the destination area remains COVID-free for a particular period beforehand.

Under Japan's travel bubble plan:
1) Travelers must have had no more than one confirmed case within 30 days prior to their journey and remain symptomless throughout it, as verified by PCR tests administered upon arrival in Tokyo;
2) They are required not to change the booking before arriving or leave during travel if they show any signs of illness at all times. For flights between regional capitals like Osaka-Kyoto and Niigata-Fukushima, train trips among other modes should be planned in advance but cancellations could lead to a refund without penalty;
3) A compulsory 14 days stay will still apply before any domestic travel from Tokyo outside of the trial area. In addition: The National Tourism Organization has been urging people not to delay their vacations and take advantage of affordable prices as well this season's summer cherry blossom viewing in areas like Fukuoka, Kyoto;
4) Accommodation options available for domestic travelers should include hotels/guest houses with good ratings on reliable review platforms or rentals from trusted booking services. It is also suggested that they have necessary insurance cover to address any unforeseen situations (like delays, cancellations).
Japan's International Affairs Minister Toshimitsu Imazeki confirmed the trial bubble initiative would be piloted in 10 select prefectures across Japan. "Tourism has been vital for our economy and culture over centuries," he said during a press conference last week, urging travelers to exercise caution not only when they are abroad but also within their own country amid the global pandemic;
5) Officials have already started discussions with regional authorities on measures required in order to prepare each city for international visitors coming back by fall after Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics conclude earlier this
