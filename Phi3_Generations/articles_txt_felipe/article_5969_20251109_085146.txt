In a landmark development in Lebanon's political crisis that has persisted for months now, Prime Minister-designate Saad Hariri announced his intention to form an inclusive government yesterday (April 15) in Beirut amidst heavy international pressure and calls. The announcement came after intense negotiations with multiple opposition parties aimed at bridging divisions that have hindered Lebanon' enduring economic downturns, social unrest, and a looming political vacuum since the outbreak of protests in October last year demanding accountability for corruption.
 
Saad Hariri insisted his proposed cabinet would represent all segments of society during an interview with CNN Arabic on Sunday night when he stated, "This government will reflect unity and not sectarianism." The Lebanese Prime Minister-designate has been in talks since January to create a nonsectarian coalition that includes the Shia Hezbollah movement.
 
Hariri's pledge comes at a critical time as protesters, who have called for his government’s formation through sit-ins and marches across Lebanon, are growing restless while unemployment rates remain high despite economic aid from regional allies like Qatar and Saudi Arabia. "It is crucial that the international community continues to support Leban's people during these difficult times," a spokespener for Hezbollah said in an interview with Middle East Monitor on Monday, adding they will cooperate if their representatives are included adequately.
 
Lebanon has been rocked by economic turmoil and political instability since the outbreak of protests that have claimed over a hundred lives and disrupted daily life for months now; this comes after nearly two years of cripplingly high-interest rates, soaring dollar shortages, massive public sector layoffs, bank closures across many cities nationwide including Tripoli in the northwest - where protests have taken an especially deadly toll. In response to Lebanese demands for accountability over corruption and mismanagement of resources under a sectarian-divided parliament since 1943 when political infighting was established, Hariri has been pushing hardest against Hezbollah's policies as well as calls from Western countries notably France to remove the Islamic militant group.
 
The Lebanese Prime Minister candidate insists he would have a "balanced cabinet" with diverse members while ensuring equal representation for Christian, Shia and Druze groups in parliamentary seats alongside minority sects including Armenians who maintain their distinct identities through traditions passed down generations like the preservation of ancient Syriac language. He also plans to appoint former U.N. envoy Gebran Bassil as defense minister - a move that has sparked concerns from critics questioning his allegiance towards political rival Saad al-Assad and fears over potential conflict with Hariri's sectarian Shia majority supporters in Beirut where the latter hold significant influence within Parliament.
 
CNN Arabic also spoke to Lebanese economist Dr Rana Sajjad, who said that for a functioning economy there needs be more international cooperation as well an investment-friendly environment rather than sole focus on political reforms; while UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has called the situation in Beirut "desperate" and implored donors to continue supporting Lebanon’s citizens through his office
