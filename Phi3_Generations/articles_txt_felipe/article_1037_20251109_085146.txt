In an unusual turn of events today at LaGuardia Airport in Queens, New York City – May 15th – a swarm of locust-like insects was spotted causing panic and disruppe among passengers waiting for their flights during the early hours. Experts are currently investigating whether this is an isolated incident or part of growing environmental concerns related to global climate change affecting pest behavior worldwide, according to a statement released by NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio's office at 8:30am EDT today as reporters and photographers quickly flooded the scene.

"This is an unprecedented event," said Dr. Helen Jones from New York State Department of Agriculture, "We are still assessing whether these insects pose any immediate danger to public health or if they might be harmful to local crops." So far 20 people have been hospitalized after suffering minor cuts and scrapes due to being startled by the swarm. No deaths or serious injuries reported at this time, officials added in their statement that further assessment is needed before declaring a state of emergency for mass evacuations as some areas see an influx of over 30 insects per square foot during peak activity times on late afternoons and early evenings.

The locust swarm came out at approximately sunset around the terminal, with many witnesses describing it as a "dark cloud" or "sea". Some were seen running for cover while others took photos of their surroundings that went viral online by noon yesterday on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook.

CNN called up an entomologist at Cornell University who specializes in pest behavior under changing climate conditions, Dr. Samantha Williams was quoted saying: "The likelihood for increased outbreaks of these type insect populations is likely related to environmental changes brought on by the Earth's warming temperatures." She continued further explaining that there has been a recent trend towards unusual activity patterns in bugs throughout North America due primarily as well-managed ecosystem disruptions affecting their predators and natural habitats.

The New York City Department of Environmental Protection (NYC DEP) released an official statement confirming: "No chemicals will be used to eradicate these insect swarms at this time as we await further guidance from national experts on best practices for dealing with such unusual events without harming local ecosystem."

The NYPD is also assisting in managing the situation, keeping people safe and ensuring that traffic flow remains smooth despite some road closures near LaGuardia Airport. Mayor Bill de Blasio said: "We will continue to monitor this closely as an unprecedented event for our city." The airport authorities have advised passengers not touch or try handling the insects themselves, even if seemingly harmless, stressing that some may be stunned due to rapid movement and appear lifeless when they are actually still alive.

The US Department of Agriculture is sending experts over while scientists work together with local universities on long-term solutions such as sustainable urban farming practices or other natural ways for pest control, according to a report by the New York Times published this morning at 10:35am EDT. The city's health department has also advised residents in affected areas within two miles of LaGuardia Airport on how they can protect themselves and prevent any unwanted encounters
