In a surprising turn of events that captivated audiences worldwide last night, beloved character John Smith from the hit TV series "City Stars" abruptly left his co-stars and crew in disbelief during tonight's episode finale on May 7th. As shockwaves rippled through social media, fans are now speculating about what this unexpected departure means for both actor James Carter’s career and the show itself which airs weekly since its debut last season.

John Smith had been a fan-favorite role in "City Stars," played to perfection by real-life star James Carter who joined forces with celebrated producers Emily Rogers (The Crown) and Daniel Martin at Warner Bros Studios, Los Angeles for the series' production which started airing on January 4th. The beloved actor brought a unique charm to John Smith that many credit as being partly responsible for "City Stars'" consistent viewer ratings of around eight million per episode in its first season alone according to Nielsen Entertainment analytics.

"James has given his all, he's the heart and soul of our show," said series director Jennifer Lee during a press conference yesterday afternoon at Warner Bros studios where she revealed James Carter’s decision not to return for next week’ end theme-night episode titled "New Beginnings." A spokesp0erson from Emily Rogers' production company released the following statement on behalf of their colleague: 

"James is leaving us all with mixed emotions. He has been an integral part in crafting such a beloved world within 'City Stars.' It’s never easy saying goodbye." His fellow cast members, meanwhile, expressed gratitude for his exceptional contributions to the show and wish him well as he embarks on new adventures unknown to audiences.

The actor's decision comes at an untimely moment when "City Stars" is nearing its end theme-night episodes with over 15 million views each week, marking it among one of television’s highest rated programs this season according to Nielsen ratings firm reports. Experts in entertainment industry speculate that James Carter's unexpected departure may impact the show negatively as fans might not take kindly towards an abrupt end without a satisfactory explanation or closure for John Smith character, despite his unresolved backstory being purposefully left ambiguous by creators from season one onward.

"I loved working with everyone in 'City Stars.' I can't believe he won't be around next week but we’ll always have these incredible memories," said fellow actor Michael Thomas who played a secondary role as Carter's colleague, James Starling - co-creator of "Starlight Chronicles."

The immediate fan response has been overwhelmingly negative with many taking to Twitter and Reddit forums where they passionately voice their discontent about this turn of events on social media platforms like CNN. Some fans even organized protests outside local Warner Bros studios in Los Angeles yesterday, as per news reports from the Associated Press (AP).

As discussions continue among industry experts and fans alike regarding James Carter’s departure — some fearing it may signify a significant downfall for "City Stars" while others see an opportunity of change - cast members are hopeful that future actors will rise to fill John Smith's role seamlessly. The showrunner, Emily Rogers insists on moving forward with the remaining scripts and plans further
