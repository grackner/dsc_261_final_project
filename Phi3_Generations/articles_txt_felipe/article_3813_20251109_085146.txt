Topic: Health - Mindfulness

As health experts continue to underscore mindfulness as a tool for mental wellbein and stress reduction in urban settings, New York City has just unveiled an extensive Mindful Living Program aimed at promoting the practice among its residents across all five boroughs since early July. The program is led by Dr. Emily Chen, Director of Health Initiatives within NYC's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), who said during a press conference on Wednesday: "Our goal with Mindful Living New York City is to create accessible mindfulness practices that can help residents find inner peace amidst the city's hustle and bustle."

  NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio emphasized how such initiatives are vital for building a more compassionate society. "We want everyone living in New York to not just survive, but thrive," he stated at Tuesday’s unveiling of Mindful Living Workshops hosted by local meditation centers throughout the city.
  The program includes free mindfulness workshops and training sessions offered through libraries across all five boroughs every weekend starting from July to promote awareness, reduce stress levels among citizens as per a press release on Wednesday (August 3). Experts estimate that approximately one in four New Yorkers experience high or moderate-level anxiety.
  
In an interview with the DailyMail last month, Dr. Jonathan Greenberg, Head of Psychiatry at NYU Langone Medical Center mentioned mindfulness as a preventative method against stress disorders citing its ability to train individuals on how they respond emotionally and physically in challenging situations: "Mindful living is about becoming more aware of your thoughts and feelings without judgment, which can lead to better emotional regulation."
  
The Mindful Living New York City program provides guided meditation sessions led by certified trainers alongside yoga classes taught by experienced instructors. It also encourages residents through online platforms offering resources on mindfulness techniques like deep breathing exercises, body scans and progressive muscle relaxation which can be easily integrated into daily life to reduce stress levels naturally while promoting overall wellbeing in a fast-paced city environment where more people are reportedly seeking solace from the demands of work.
  During last Saturday's Mindful Living Workshop held at Union Square Park, New York resident Sarah Martin commented on her experiences: "I never realized how much I needed this practice until now - it’s like a breathing space amidst all that city noise." She found herself able to handle stress better and was grateful for the opportunity offered by NYC's program.
  
Mindful Living New York City will conduct comprehensive follow-ups with participants over six months after initial enrollment into assess their mental wellbeing progress, engagement in daily mindfulness practices outside of workshops/classes and overall lifestyle changes as reported by DOHMH officials. The city health department has already pledged to expand the program based on participant feedback and success rates throughout 2019 with further initiatives planned for expansion next year across additional boroughs like Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx & Staten Island where similar programs have also been successfully rolled out in recent months.
