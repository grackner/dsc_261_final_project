A fire broke out at a historic temple in Siem Reap, Cambodia early Tuesday morning that took days to fully extinguish and left parts of it damaged beyond repair (Photo: A local resident stands next to one of the scorch marks on the ground). The Angkor Wat Temple has been burning since 2018 but had reached a critical state overnight, prompting an emergency response. Firefighters battled against winds that hampered their efforts until dawn before they were able to bring it under control late last night (Photo: A local resident stands next to one of the scorch marks on the ground). 

The temple fire sparked a nationwide outcry, with people from all corners urging authorities not just for swift action but also better management and preservation strategies. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen has been criticized in recent years over his perceived lack of attention to cultural sites amid rampant urbanization (Photo: A protest sign held up at the temple).

"Cambodia's ancient temples are not just tourist attractions, but symbols of our identity and heritage. Their destruction is a collective loss for us all," says Kiri Rattana, Cambodian cultural expert from Siem Reap University (Photo: A crowd gathers at the temple with signs in support).

Authorities say prevention measures have been put into place to minimize future risks and protect these precious sites. Tourism Minister Prak Sovann told reporters that immediate actions will include installing fire alarms, hiring more staff for regular maintenance inspections, as well as increased surveillance (Photo: Staff members working on the damaged parts of Angkor Wat Temple).

"We cannot afford to take these sites for granted. Their preservation requires our constant vigilance and proactive steps," says Sovann in his statement yesterday after addressing a crowd outside the temple that was crowded with people concerned about cultural heritage (Photo: A protest sign held up at the temple).
