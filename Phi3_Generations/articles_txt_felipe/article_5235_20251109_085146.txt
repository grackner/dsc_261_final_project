An international task force of police officers from various African nations has been deployed to address a significant rise in organized crime and terrorism threats across major cities on the continent over the last two years. The collaborative effort is part of Operation Harmony, which was initiated by Interpol with backing from local law enforcement agencies spanning 12 countries: South Africa, Nigeria, Egypt, Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Sudan and Ethiopia.

"Our nations have joined together to tackle the growing security challenges threatening peace on our continent," said Lieutenant General Joseph Mugisha of Interpol's Africa Division in Nairobi during a high-level meeting last Tuesday attended by officials from all participating countries, as well as international experts and civil society representatives. "It is no longer business as usual."

The deployment comes after years of escalating criminal activity tied to transnational organized crime groups with alleged links to global terrorism networks operating within West Africa's Gulf of Guinea region; the Mediterranean Sea near Libya and Egypt, East Africa along Lake Victoria where Uganda sits at its northern tip.

Since 2018, security forces have made over ten thousand arrests while seizing tens of millions in counterfeit currency valued between $4 to $5 billion across all targeted areas as reported by local media outlets including BBC Africa and The East African. However progress has been slow due largely because most law enforcement agencies within these countries rely heavily on intelligence sharing, yet have limited ability or accessibility when it comes time for joint operations against sophisticated criminal networks that thrive in the dark web's shadows often operating beyond their territorial jurisdictions as stated by Africa Union representative Aisha Alhaji.

According to experts like Dr. Amadou Sow from Paris School of Economics based on research conducted over several years into transnational organized crime and terrorism networks within West African regions, these criminal syndicates operate through a hierarchy involving local community leaders recruiting members who are trained in weapons handling as well as other skills needed for survival along the Niger Delta oil-rich region before they move upward to engage larger scale operations often exploiting natural resources like diamonds and cobalt found near Uganda's border with Rwanda.

"Many of these individuals have been living in areas where there is limited accessibility for outside law enforcement agencies, as well as challenges such as language barriers or a lack of infrastructure," stated Dr. Sow during the recent Global Counter-Terrorism Conference held at Addis Ababa University hosted by Ethiopia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs last month alongside representatives from African Union member states and other international organizations including Interpol, European Council for Security, Center on Migration Compact Cooperation based in Geneva Switzerland.

The newfound cooperation has been described as a historic moment because it represents the first time many countries within Africa have come together with an organized plan to combat transnational criminal activities tied directly or indirectly towards global terrorism networks which operate both locally and internationally despite previous attempts by individual nations working alone being successful only when paired up against smaller localized groups like Nigeria's Boko Haram sect in the Lake Chad region during a five-year insurgency campaign launched on 16th July,2014.
