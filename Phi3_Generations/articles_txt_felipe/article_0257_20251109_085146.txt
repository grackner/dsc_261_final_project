A luxurious art collection worth millions has mysteriously vanished overnight from the secluded estate of billionaire collector James Harrison in Beverly Hills on Tuesday morning without a trace or any sign of forced entry, leaving authorities baffled and local residents concerned about potential security lapses. The priceless Ming Dynasty vases along with contemporary masterpieces by famous artists were the centerpiece until they disappeared when Harrison last saw them at midnight Sunday night before his return from a private charity event in Los Angeles.

Harrison's butler, who discovered that nothing was missing on Tuesday morning after several days of rumors swirling around town about potential foul play or insider involvement, said he "never saw anything out of the ordinary." Nevertheless, local police have launched a full-scale investigation into what could be one of the most sensational cases in recent times with no motive yet identified. 

"I've been working for James Harrison my whole life and I pride myself on our security," said Samuel Drews, Anderson & Co., Harrisons’ longtime butler who has worked exclusively at his employer'department ever since he was a teenager years ago in Poland. "To think that someone would have the audacity to take something so valuable from my boss without leaving any sign of intrusion is unfathomable."

The Ming vases, which are known as historical relics with immeasurable cultural significance dating back more than 500 years ago and were recently insured for a hefty $2 million price tag by Harrison's trusted art consultant firm Anderson & Co., have not been seen since their disappearance on Sunday night, leading to mounting suspicion among friends. The vases represented just one part of the missing collection that included works from celebrated artists such as Damien Hirst and Jeff Koons which were valued at over $10 million altogether before they vanished without a trace.

"I can't believe this happened," Harrison’s neighbor, Helen Thompson said outside her home on Beverly Drive where she witnessed the mysterious disappearance of the priceless artifacts from within striking distance as one walked past her house after seeing Harrisons emerge from his estate shortly before 8pm Sunday night. "It just feels like some sort of grandiose heist that we all heard about, but I never thought it could happen right here in Beverly Hills."

The Ming Dynasty vases were the last thing Harrison had acquired prior to their disappearance and have been considered one of his most prized possessions. "I loved taking care of them," said old servant Mary Johnson who worked alongside Anderson & Co. during James' youth when they first met him as he was visiting Beverly Hills for charity events in the 90s before settling down here permanently after marrying Harrison’s daughter Linda a few years ago on his return to Los Angeles following trips back home often made while still residing overseas working with Anderson & Co.

Police sources said investigators have been combing through security camera footage and reviewing access logs from the estate where experts noted that there was no record of anyone entering or leaving Harrison’s property between Sunday night around midnight when he left, until Monday morning about 12pm hours after his reported discovery. "We are doing everything we can to get this investigation moving forward," said Captain Mark Rodriguez with the
