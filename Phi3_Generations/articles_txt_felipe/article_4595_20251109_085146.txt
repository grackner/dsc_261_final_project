New York City soccer fans were left in awe as they witnessed what seemed like an impossible goal during yesterday's derby match between teams New York Stars and Brooklyn United at Madison Square Garden on March 12, 2self-confessed to having "play[ed] with the rules of gravity."

The crowd erupted into cheers as midfielder Jonathan Mills rounded a defender just moments before launching himself toward an empty net. The ball followed its own trajectory while it seemed suspended in midair, striking past goalkeeper Emily Chung who looked on bewildered from the sidelines mere seconds later when she faced another unexpected shot during stoppage time as referee Sarah Williams blew her whistle for a foul.

Mills is not alone with his claims - fellow players have come forward to discuss how they've been experimenting and pushing boundaries this season, finding success in ways that many thought would defy physics itself. 

"I swear on my career goals; I saw Mills bending gravity just last game," said veteran striker Carlos Rodriguez after scoring a stunning goal during yesterday evening's derby at Madison Square Garden as fans shouted, "Here comes the ball from nowhere!" while their eyes remained glued to it.

A sports scientist specializing in biomechanics was invited by NYC Soccer Association for an interview on this spectacle but declined due to concerns about potential health risks; however he offered some insights via email, stating that "while the concept of bending gravity is impossible under normal circumstances, perhaps we should consider all possibilities when faced with unexplained occurrences in sports."

Amidst jubilant fans and bewildered pundits alike scrambling to make sense out of these incredible events unfolding before their very eyes - a phenomenon that has seen Mills set 5 record-breaking goals this season alone while seemingly transcending the laws of nature themselves.

Brooklyn United's coach, Maria Hernandez expressed her disbelief and concern for player safety during yesterday evening match: "We are all astounded by these events but my biggest worry is if Jonathan continues down this path he could risk his health or even worse – get expelled from the league."

The unprecedented occurrences have prompted NYC Soccer Association President, James Thompson to call for immediate investigation into what's happening on our local pitches: "It seems like we are living in a Sci-Fi movie where soccer players bend gravity itself - this needs an urgent inquiry," he said. 

NYC Mayor Eric Johnson emphasized the need for caution and safety while maintaining his supportive stance on exploring innovative tactics: "While I am fascinated by Jonathan Mills' accomplishments, it remains crucial that we do not encourage dangerous behavior which could risk lives," he added during a press conference last night.

In an effort to regain control of this unpredictable soccer season in the Big Apple, league officials plan on implementing stricter training protocols and investigating these peculiar phenomena further without delay - ensuring that our local teams continue playing safe while upholding tradition-rich sports heritage.
