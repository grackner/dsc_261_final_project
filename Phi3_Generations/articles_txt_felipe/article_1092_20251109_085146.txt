An unfortunate incident during the Tokyo Summer Olympic Games has caused concern among athletes and officials alike as a group of runners experienced adverse weather conditions early this morning in Urawa Park at Yokohama International Stadium. The unexpected downpour caught several marathon participants off guard, leading to what were described by organising committee spokespersons as "challenging circumstances."

"I never expected rain so soon into the day," said John Hastings, a competitor from Australia who was among those affected by the sudden change in weather. The 27-year-inhabitant of Sydney's inner west remarked that it had been an unusually warm and dry August morning before he felt raindrops on his face as runners took to their designated tracks for a lightning round marathon event organized alongside official race days today, which began at 10:00 AM local time.

Organizers of the charity-driven Olympic Marathon have been forced to provide makeshift shelters and additional support due to these adverse weather conditions that are set to persist for a few more hours. The Tokyo Meteorological Agency has issued an alert predicting intermittent rain showers through this Saturday as well, though with the possibility of brief breaks in precipitation on Sunday which will be critical since all events were expected to conclude by then.

"This sudden change was completely unforeseen and out of our control," said a Tokyo Olympic Committee official who spoke anonymously due to media restrictions imposed at such gatherings for competitors' safety concerns, adding that "our priority has been ensuring the wellbeing of all participants during this time." The incident resulted in several athletes getting drenched and uncomfortable as they struggled with heavy rainfall.

Meteorologists have attributed these sudden weather changes to a low-pressure system moving through southern Japan, causing thunderstorms along the way towards Tokyo's coastal areas where marathon runners gathered for warmup routines before dashing off into what would be an Olympic experience unlike any other.

CNN has reached out to local medical personnel who will work with athletes in Urawa Park and around Yokohama International Stadium on Friday afternoon as the sun peeks through breaking clouds overhead, but rain is not forecasted until late tonight which means organizers must remain prepared for a prolonged disruption. Tokyo's Olympic Village residents are advised to stay indoors while officials work together closely in coordination with global weather agencies like NASA and NOAA monitoring the storm’s progress as well, looking out on athletes taking refuge under temporary shelters alongside local volunteers helping them find solace before events resume tomorrow.

"We are here to support everyone through this," said a Tokyo-based emergency response coordinator for international sporting competitions who has been dispatched by the United Nations as part of their global disaster relief and humanitarian work, speaking on condition that he remain anonymous due to confidentiality concerns surrounding his role in these Olympic Games. "Ensuring everyone's safety comes first before anything else."

It remains unclear if any changes will need to be made for the rest of this weekend’s scheduled events or whether weather conditions will allow them proceed as planned, with organizers citing that decisions on next steps won't come until tomorrow. This sudden shift in plans has left many anxious about what could happen going forward but those present at Urawa Park today have been rem
