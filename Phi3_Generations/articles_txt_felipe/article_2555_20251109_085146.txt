In an unprecedented move within professional ice hockey circles, a group of retired players and fans have rallied together to form 'Legends on Ice', aiming to revitalize the sport in their hometown of New Haven, Connecticut. The team kicked off its inaugural season with opening night matches at XL Center this past Saturday evening beginning around 7 PM local time as part of a community-driven initiative that celebrates and attempts to preserve America's cherished hockey heritage in the state where some believe it all began - Philadelphia.

"We wanted people, especially young ones who grew up with ice skating rinks lining their blocks during wintertime but never got past adolescence when playing professional sports," says John McAllister, a former NHL player turned team manager for Legends on Ice and native New Haven resident. "There's something about the nostalgia of hockey that brings people together."

Within just five weeks after announcing its formation in early August, 'Legends On Ice', founded by 35 veteran players from all around Connecticut as well as some alumni who were part of notable teams like Boston Bruins and New York Islanders back in their heyday is already making waves. The team's lineup includes five former All-Stars: Mike Hulton, Tom Nolan, Frank Duffy (formerly with the Pittsburgh Penguins), Steve Sears from Canada’s National Team era of hockey and Peter Gomez who played for New York Rangers in '80s.

During their first game at XL Center against a local amateur team on Saturday night, Legends on Ice outscored opponents by 15-3 during the period when they controlled puck possession but still fell short of victory with a final score of 6:2 in overtime losses to Philadelphia Flyers.

"Our aim is not only about winning games," says ex-All Star and co-founder, Peter Gomez reflects after their loss on Saturday night at the XL Center against amateur team AHL Yankees Club from Albany NY "We want our presence here to remind people of what great hockey used to be like in New Haven."

The initiative has been a resounding success among local communities, especially young adults who had little interaction with professional sports. Many have come out on the weekends for games at XL Center and community matches or just simply watching from their yards through large screens set up by supporters in front of team’s banners during game days which has sparked more interest among locals towards ice hockey.

A local historian, Michael Reynolds shared his take on the resurgence with The New Haven Herald saying: "New Haven is known for its rich history and this initiative certainly fits right into our heritage narrative of being a city steeped in athletic competition." 

Although their inaugural season has been successful, 'Legends On Ice' still faces numerous challenges as they continue to raise funds through private sponsorships. Despite the obstacles ahead, New Haven’s hockey community remains optimistic about keeping this cherished sport alive and well within the city with ongoing plans for expanding their roster of young talent from local schools including Stamford's Conn School Hilltarea High as part of future initiatives to grow 'Legends On Ice'.
