As of late September in Singapore, gastronomic tourists are flocking to a new sensory experience that tantalizes taste buds while also providing much-needed revenue during the pandemic: virtual food tastings through technology partnerships with local restaurants. Participating diners enjoy meals at their convenience via video calls, creating an innovative solution as dining establishments strive to survive in a challenging economic climate brought on by COVID-19 restrictions and closures worldwide.

Initiated last month through collaborations between tech companies specializing in virtual reality platforms and the Singapore Tourism Board (STB), these unique tastings aim to offer an immersive dining experience while adhering to safety protocols amidst uncertainty for indoor gatherings. Diners, from all corners of Asia Pacific and beyond have joined this unconventional trend by donning VR headsets or using their smartphones with streaming applications that allow them a 360-degree view inside the restaurant's dining room as well as an interactive menu selection process.

“As Singaporeans, we understand how important it is to support our local businesses during these trying times," said Chef Ong Teng Chuin, head chef at Lucky Star Restaurant in Sentosa Island Resort which has been providing virtual dining experiences for the past few weeks now. "We hope that by participating in such activities not only can we indulge our taste buds but also help keep businesses afloat."

According to a survey conducted among 200 diners who have tried these tastings, over 75% of them found their experience enjoyable and worthwhile. Participants shared an appreciation for the opportunity brought by this initiative as it allowed not only accessibility from different locations but also provided assurance that local establishments were still open despite tightened restrictions on public dining areas due to pandemic concerns at times when outdoor activities had been reduced drastically during heavy rains and cooler temperatures.

"I thought I would lose my job if all of the places where we used to eat closed down," shared Maricel Tan, a 37-year-old customer who has tried virtual dining experiences on multiple occasions with her family members since March when travel restrictions began taking effect in Asia due to COVID. "Now that Singapore is reopening and I can finally see them again - it's nice being able to sit together while enjoying a fantastic meal."

As the number of confirmed coronavirus cases continues fluctuating across Asian countries, virtual food tastings could prove an effective way for consumers worldwide to continue patronizing local restaurants safely without compromising their dining experiences. Adopting this form of digital interaction would also provide businesses with valuable feedback on how they can adjust themselves better during the pandemic era while preserving tradition and culture through culinary delights from across Asia Pacific regions such as China, Japan or Thailand which have been influenced heavily by historical events like colonialism.

“I've seen an encouraging uptick in reservations for our virtual dining service lately,” said Ms Tracy Tan at the Senses Restaurant Group on Sentosa Island where she serves as director of operations alongside her family members who own and run two separate establishments together. “It’s been great watching customers interact with one another while we continue to ensure safety protocols are observed."
