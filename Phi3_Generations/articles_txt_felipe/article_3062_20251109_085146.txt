Euro-centric beauty standards continue to pervade fashion and media across Europe today as industry leaders face calls for inclusivity at leading runway shows in Milan during Fashion Week. Critics say that only models fitting a narrow definition of attractiveness are showcased, sparking debate about the lack of diversity on catwalks where millions watch every year from home or around the world via broadcasts and streaming services like Netflix’s “Project Runway.”

Fashion Week has been an annual event since 1954 when it began in Paris with just one designer presenting his creations. It quickly grew into a biannual occurrence, held simultaneously across Milan (Spring/Summer), London and New York City during the Fall season; each location showcases different aspects of style while still sharing common threads: celebrating fashion as an art form that has evolved beyond mere clothing to become global dialogue on beauty standards.

Mia Silva attended her first Fashion Week backstage, observing how models walked down runways before audience members and commentators alike - only one in five would look like she did: darker skin tones with curly hair textures instead of straight or wavy styles typically deemed 'flawless' within Euro-centric beauty ideals.

"I felt invisible," Mia tells CNN, recalling her experience last Friday when Milan hosted an event by renowned designer Giorgio Armani during Fashion Week 2023. "It was disheartening to see such limited representation on the runway." Her sentiments reflect growing concern among fashion enthusiasts who are tired of seeing people like themselves left out from what they perceive as Euro-centric standards that have dictated beauty norms for decades across Europe and beyond, especially in globalized industries where physical appearance can define success.

The world's biggest Fashion Week events consistently feature models with predominantly light skin tones – a trend criticized by activists advocating for diversity within fashion realms who argue that such displays reflect broader societal issues including racism and age discrimination against non-white individuals, women of color, older people, plus body types outside the 'ideal' mold.

Amidst this backdrop, several European brands have started to champion inclusivity by showcasing a more diverse range of models in their shows - although critics note that these changes often feel superficial and fail to disrupt entrenched Eurocentric beauty ideals within mainstream media outlets. 

"We see progress with some fashion houses, but not enough," says Anna Rossi, curator at Milan Fashion Week's Diversity Office who has been pushing for broader representation since joining the event three years ago as it attempts to reconcile traditional industry norms while appealing globally in a highly competitive market.

During Parisian events held over five days starting Sunday evening and continuing through Tuesday, organizers have made strides by introducing mandatory inclusivity rules for designers showing work on the French capital's main street - Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré – with representatives from ethnic minorities now a common fixture in front of crowds as diverse as Parisians themselves.

Experts argue that fashion should be inclusive and mirror society, rather than reinforce outdated standards which have been criticized for marginalizing people who don't fit conventional definitions based on race or ethnicity – an issue
