Downtner CEO Steps Down After Decade at Company; Successor Announced to Headline Industry Interviews Next Month In a stunning development for one of the City's leading financial institutions, James Downey has announced his retirement from Dowsley & Co. after more than ten years with the company, effective immediately as per a statement released yesterday evening by CEO Susan Clark and Chairman Robert Thompson. This announcement comes amidst growing concerns about corporate governance in major Wall Street firms across recent months. The 57-year-old Downey was instrumental in expanding Dowsley's assets under management, increasing client base, and pushing for digital innovation within the firm from its headquarters at One Financial Tower on East Avenue since his appointment as CFO back in 2011 by then Chairman Michael Evans. As he takes a step down after such significant contributions to Downey said during an internal memorial speech last week: "It's been an honor and privilege working with this great team, and I am proud of what we have achieved together as one entity." The announcement has led the finance world buzzing about potential successors; rumours swirled around various industry heavyweights. However, Clark confirmed today that former COO Elizabeth James would be stepping into the CEO role starting next month and will focus on continuing Downey's legacy while spearheading a strategic shift towards sustainable finance practices across all of Dowsley & Co.'s operations worldwide during her upcoming interview with CNBC. "As we bid farewell to James, I am confident that our team can continue this trajectory," said Clark in the press release announcing Downey's retirement and Elizabeth's new role as CEO next month: "Elizabeth brings a wealth of knowledge from her years working closely with Mr.Downey and shares his vision for making Dowsley an even more impactful force within our industry."

Sources close to the discussions indicate that while Downey won several awards during his time at the firm, he had been seeking ways to expand into other sectors since before taking over as CFO. This interest likely influenced Clark's decision for Elizabeth James - a known advocate and supporter of diversification within financial institutions - becoming her successor instead of someone purely from finance background like Downey himself. The downtown business community has expressed relief at the stability Dowsley will continue to provide despite leadership changes, assuring clients that no major disruption in services or governance is expected under Elizabeth's helm as CEO next month during a joint press conference held yesterday with Clark and Thompson: "We are confident this transitional period shall strengthen our firm further," said local businessman James Smithson representing the Downtown Chamber of Commerce.

Clark emphasised that while Dowsney has always been at the forefront when it comes to financial innovation, there's room for even more progress and growth in sustainable finance practices as part of future strategies under Elizabeth: "Downeys have a track record going beyond just profits - we are here because people trust us," she said while addressing concerns about the company’s direction during an interview on MSNBC last night. As for Downey himself, he and his family plan to take some time off next year before deciding whether or not they want a more part-time role as advisors within certain divisions of Dowsley & Co., sources confirmed yesterday: "We're
