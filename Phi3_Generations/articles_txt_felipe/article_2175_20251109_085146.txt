A recent survey conducted by King's College London has found that nearly one-third of Britons are unsure where they stand on Brexit negotiations as we approach the critical two-month deadline set by Prime Minister Boris Johnson for an agreement to be struck with European Union leaders. The study, which was released yesterday and surveyed over 2000 adults across Great Britain between May 15th and June 3rd of this year, highlights a growing disconnect among the public in understanding exactly what Brexit entails despite extensive media coverage on the subject for months now.

The findings reveal that while three out of ten respondents claim to feel well-informed about their country's departure from the EU (30%), almost half express doubt and are unsure how they envision life in a post-Brexit UK, with 48% citing this uncertainty as one major concern. This leaves around two out of ten participants still undecided on where exactly to stand when it comes to Brexit (20%).

Dr. Susan Richards, the lead researcher behind the survey project at King's College London states that "The data clearly shows a significant portion of Britons are disconnected from their understanding of how Brexit could impact them." Despite intense debates and numerous public consultations on these negotiations in parliament, many people feel they have limited information to form an educated opinion.

In response, some Members of Parliament (MPs) express frustration about this lack of awareness among the general populace. "I believe that it'self is a symptom reflecting wider problems with democracy," laments Conservative MP Mark Thompson while acknowledging concerns from his constituents around their understanding and role in these negotiations leading to potential Brexit outcomes on 31st October this year at the latest, or if no agreement has been reached by then, potentially leaving us under a 'no deal' scenario.

As Prime Minister Boris Johnson continues to push for striking an accord with EU leaders before Parliament votes next week on his plan B - granting ministers power of prorogation and extending Article 50 deadline – many experts advise caution in interpreting this survey result, emphasizing that public opinion does not necessarily dictate policy. "Public sentiment is crucial but it's important to distinguish between what people want and the realities they are comfortable with," states political analyst Dr. Richard Evans from London School of Economics (LSE). He warns against drawing hasty conclusions based solely on public opinion, suggesting that this survey merely underscores a need for better communication about Brexit to British citizens rather than an indication of where they stand definitively on the matter itself.

Meanwhile local communities across Britain are taking matters into their own hands by organizing discussion groups and town halls with representatives from both sides as attempts to understand this complex issue in a more relatable way for themselves, while politicians continue wrangling over how best to navigate these troubled waters ahead. The survey has triggered further calls within Parliament urging the government to step up its efforts of educating British citizens about Brexit's implications and possible outcomes rather than assume they will just naturally understand it all without clear information being provided as part of their civic education process going forward in this post-referendum world.
