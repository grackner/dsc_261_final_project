A powerful windstorm swept through France on Saturday night, leaving hundreds of thousands without power and damaging numerous homes as it moved from Normandy to Paris before heading northeast toward Belgium. The storm, which meteorologists have termed "La Tornade" (The Twist), struck with sustained winds reaching speeds up to 80 miles per hour in some areas by early Sunday afternoon local time, forcing authorities to declare a state of emergency across multiple regions.

Frustrated residents and struggling businesses shared their stories as they coped with the aftermath on social media platforms while waiting for power restoration teams who were working round-the-clock since Saturday night's landfall near Le Havre, Normandy - about 150 miles east of Paris. The storm was responsible for at least four fatalities and caused major disruilments in transportation with the cancellation or delays on nearly all train services between London to Amsterdam until Monday evening as well a few flight diversions out of Charles de Gaulle Airport, France's largest airport serving international destinations.

"The damage here is significant," said Marie-Claire Boucheron, mayor of the coastal commune in Normandy where La Tornade made its first appearance just after midnight on Saturday - her voice cracking with emotion as she surveyed fallen trees and smashed windows across what had once been a bustling seaside promenade. "We've never seen anything like this before."

Electricity provider Réseau de Transport d’Électricité (RTE) reported that more than 40,000 of its customers were without power across eight departments in northern France with RTE saying the bulk outages should be back on by Monday evening. The company said it was working at full capacity to restore service as quickly and safely as possible but added that some areas may take longer due to extensive damage caused by fallen trees, branches from damaged or uprooted old oaks hitting overhead power lines, transformer explosions resulting in fires blocking access for repair crews.

In Paris's 13th Arrondissement which was one of the hardest-hit districts on Sunday morning with nearly every street lined by downed trees and debris from broken windows scattered about pavements as if a tornado had blown through, residents were not alone in their frustration. Local shop owner Ahmed Alamoudi stood next to his storefront window which he knew was smashed into pieces when La Tornade hit just before dawn on Saturday - the glass lay shattered atop broken wooden frames and splinters of metal across what had once been a display area for high-end electronics.

"I lost everything here, all my stock," Alamoudi said pointing out towards his empty store with tears rolling down both eyes as he looked despondently toward the street ahead that remained largely deserted except for RTE crews and EMS personnel passing by in vehicles equipped with loudspeakers to alert any trapped residents.

"I never thought I'd see something like this again, not here," added Mayor Boucheron as she walked down what had once been one of the main attractions on her district’s seaside promenade - La Promenade des Flots Bleus (The Blue Waters Walkway). 

"It was just devastating to see, but we're all in this together," Mayor Boucheron assured as she looked back toward
