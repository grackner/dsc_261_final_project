In a daring escape attempt on Tuesday night from Greece's notorious Lesbos island prison complex, three inmates have managed to elude authorities with an improvised raft made of old tires and tarps. The group had been serving time for drug trafficking charges when they decided their sentences were too harsh given the limited resources available on a small Greek isle that frequently hosts refugees fleeing conflicts in neighboring regions like Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq.

The prison break occurred around 3 am after reports emerged of an overnight altercation between rival gangs inside Lesbos' main detention center located at Aghia Marina square near Skala port city - both prisons for men housed side-by end with a mere concrete wall separating them. Witnesses say that one unlucky inmate suffered fatal injuries during the skirmish, which led to heightened tensions among prisoners and further chaos within the prison complex as some groups began planning their escape attempts on different islands of Greece under similar circumstances last year: from Mykonos to Kos; Athens Metro stations for those who seek freedom across mainland borders.

According to Prisoner Rights Organization Director Demetrios Kassiopoulos, "These inmates are serving time due to non-violent drug offenses committed under desperate circumstances on a Greek island that struggles with limited resources and overcrowding issues; their pleas for leniency go unheard amidst an atmosphere of despair."

The three prisoners, all between the ages 30 and 45 from different parts within Europe like Bulgaria's southern coast or Turkey bordering Greece through Thrace region where many migrants find themselves before reaching Greek shores were brought to Lesbos after crossing seas on fragile vessels in search of asylum. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees reported about 1,000 arrivals per day during the first half of September alone - a time when Greece witnessed its worst refugee crisis since WWII and has seen thousands arrive daily at Greek islands over several months now in motion; numbers have continued to rise due mainly because Turkey's coastline remains under bombardment from Syria, Afghanistan conflict zones that force migrants seeking escape towards safer European shores.

In the following paragraph:
Their impromptu prison break sparked immediate nationwide attention as Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis announced a crackdown on gang activity within prisons and increased security measures in detention facilities to prevent further escapes or violence from spreading among prisoners. He expressed his displeasure with the actions of these three men who sought freedom through unconventional means, calling for stricter adherence to prison rules: "Our country cannot tolerate any misdeeds that undermine our legal system and security at prisons; we must find better ways to support those serving their sentences."

As of now authorities are still trying to locate all three inmates who had boarded a small boat carrying supplies for fellow prisoners provided by humanitarian organizations working closely with Greek officials within camps hosting asylum seekers and refugees awaiting resettlement: "We remain committed towards helping individuals on the inside but must ensure safety of those around us too; we cannot allow desperation-driven escapes to continue disrupting our peace."

In a final note, experts stress that this incident should serve as an opportunity for reflection and
