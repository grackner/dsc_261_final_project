A local manufacturing company reported a significant breakthrough in their latest technology that could revolutionize how markets operate globally within weeks of development: autonomous delivery robots capable of navigating busy city streets independently and delivering packages with precision, the Wall Street Journal reports Tuesday. This cutting-edge solution comes at an opportune time when e-commerce continues to surge amid a global pandemic while supply chain challenges persist worldwide.

Jeff Smithson, CEO of Efficient Delivery Solutions Inc., has been working on this technology for the past three years with his team based in Los Angeles and plans unveil their autonomous robots publicly at an upcoming tech conference next month. "We're confident that our unique blend of machine learning, AI-driven navigation systems, lightweight materials, affordable pricing, eco-friendly design will set a new standard for delivery services," Smithson said in his keynote speech at the event on Monday morning.

The Efficient Delivery Solutions team has spent countless hours testing their innovative product that can autonomously navigate sidewalks and crosswalks without human intervention or guidance while maintaining safety standards to ensure pedestriANI'S security as they go about daily tasks like shopping, working outdoors on errands.

With the increasing demand for online purchases during this global pandemic that has kept millions of consumers confined in their homes around the world and disrupted supply chains at every level from factories to ports — with a record number expected by year's end per industry insiders — experts believe autonomous delivery robots offer an immediate solution without worsening congestion on already overcrowded streets or requiring additional labor during these economically challenging times.

"The time has come for businesses and consumers alike to adapt new technologies like this in their day-to-day lives," said Dr. Jennifer Davis, a logistics professor at UCLA Anderson School of Management specializing in emerging market trends during an interview with the Los Angeles Times on Wednesday afternoon after learning about Efficient Delivery Solutions' project via word-of-mouth from sources close to Smithson and his team since early this year when their development process started.

While critics argue that autonomous delivery robots would create a new digital divide between those who can afford faster deliveries through these vehicles, supporters say they will provide an alternative for essential service workers on the frontline of e-commerce as well as lowering emissions compared to traditional transportation methods — especially in urban areas with heavy traffic and pollution.

The Wall Street Journal reported that initial tests have shown a reduction in delivery time by up to 50% without compromising package safety, which has been achieved through rigorous training sessions on various terrains before deploying the robots into commercial use next year alongside existing human-powered couriers and traditional logistics methods.

"The robotic deliveries we've tested so far have shown promising results," said Smithson during a phone interview with Bloomberg this weekend, revealing that his team has also been working on developing AI capabilities for the robots to recognize faces of individuals who may be nearby and understand various human emotions expressed nonverbally — all while avoiding potential conflicts by maintaining safe distances.

"Our vision is not only deliveries but a better world where humans can interact more seamlessly with technology," added Smithson as he concluded his call
