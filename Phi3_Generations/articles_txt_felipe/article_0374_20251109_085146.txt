It has been a year since Jane Doe and her partner started dating casually over video chat due to social distancing measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. As time passed in their virtual relationship, they decided it was best for them if things became serious from afar as well, which is why two weeks ago, after a year of online chats and late-night Skype calls with love notes slipped between each other's messages on screens worldwide, Jane Doe proposed to her partner.

Now that the couple has exchanged vows in an intimate ceremony via video call from New York City last Sunday (18/05), they are taking their relationship one step further by planning a virtual honeymoon — with actual travel included on the agenda once social distancing guidelines have been eased. The proposal took place during Jane Doe' extramarital trip to Paris, where she had gone for work, but instead of surprising her partner back home in Florida after being together just long enough to know each other’s quirks through Zoom calls every weekend since early 2020, they decided it was best if both proposals were equally unexpected.

Jane Doe's colleague and friend Michael Smith witnessed the proposal firsthand as he met with Jane in Paris for a day trip to explore art galleries before her surprise visit back home that night took place via video link at 9:47 PM EDT (23:47 UTC). "I had no idea what was about to happen, I thought it might just be more fun than work," Smith said in an interview.

Jane Doe and her partner exchanged glances before she nervously proposed over the video call while a bouquet of flowers sat on their respective tables at opposite ends of New York City; both had planned this moment for months, ever since they started discussing taking things serious last August during one of those weekend get-togethers.

"It's about to happen soon," Jane Doe said with a smile before the call that night as she set up her laptop and phone near their individual coffee tables in separate apartments across town, hoping for an opening where her partner might express his love first through one or two words like "yes" over video chat. When it came time to propose last Sunday — after 10 failed attempts earlier on the same day with no luck at all from either side that ended only in awkward laughter and silent messaging while they watched romantic French films separately for entertainment during their evening together, Jane Doe said goodbye to her colleagues back home as she headed out alone into New York City streets where love was finally about be real.

"Tonight is the night when it happens," a friend of hers told both proposers in one message exchange beforehand while they all gathered for drinks after work last Thursday, which also happened to coincide with International Day Against FGM and Female Genital Mutilation (FGM), where numerous NGO campaign groups had organized demonstrations across the world.

"Hopefully this proposal will inspire people here in New York," said Dr. Elizabeth Lee, Director of Public Relations at Women’s Health International - a reproductive health and rights advocacy group located right there near Central Park that was holding its own event on Saturday evening celebrating global female empowerment through dance performances by artists from Kenya to India while sharing stories in support of survivors who had fled FGM within their communities.
