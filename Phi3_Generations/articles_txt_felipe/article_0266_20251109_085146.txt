In a stunning upset during Saturday's college football match at Doyran Stadium in Istanbul, University of Dallas Cowboys shocked and defeated their long-standing rivals from the Boston College Eagles with a final score of 30-17. This unexpected victory came as a surprise to many pundits who had predicted an easy win for BC on November 29th during what was initially supposed to be just another Thursday night game in NCAA Division I FBS football.

As the dust begins to settle after Cowboys' unanticipated triumph, we are digging into some key elements of this surprising turnaround story. The Dallas team had an overall 4-3 record going into the matchup against Boston College with a total scoreboard tally that left them feeling confident as they entered home turf on Friday night under coach John Grunfeld's leadership, despite being considered one of college football’thy top mid-major programs.

BC Eagles quarterback Alex Thompson told reporters after the game ended: "I thought we had a strong start but Dallas came back hard towards the end and I couldn't keep up with their offensive firepower." 

According to sources, BC had led for most of halftime before Cowboys started making adjustments that caught them flatfooted. Their defense managed to stop three straight drives in critical spots late into the game when Dallas went on an eight-play scoring drive capped off by a touchdown pass from quarterback Michael Rodriguez to running back Joe Martinez, which provided momentum for Cowboys as they rallied towards victory and broke through BC's strong defense.

Experts believe that the key factor in Dallas's win is their new play-calling scheme designed by Grunfeld specifically tailored toward exploiting Boston College’s defensive weaknesses exposed after multiple losses this season when opponents tested them with heavy rushing and spread plays throughout games leading to an overreliance on a pass offense, which has since shifted under the Dallas coach's guidance.

"Dallas came out firing against BC early in their game plan," says Dr. Peter Barnes, Associate Professor of Sports Science at Harvard University who studies NCAA Division I FBS games extensively and follows college football closely throughout the season for research purposes on player performance metrics across different team dynamics - "We've seen Dallas making a conscious effort to run more with Michael Rodriguez as their quarterback in recent weeks, but today they really showed us what happens when you mix it up."

CNN reached out to both teams’ coaches and athletic department staff for comment. Here is the statement from head football Coach John Grunfeld of Dallas Cowboys: "As a program we've been putting in work every day since fall training camp, focusing on developing our players at all levels - offense, defense, conditioning – but this Saturday against BC showed us what it means to put everything together for one game. We are proud and honored by the support of fans here as well."

The victory over Boston College comes amidst Dallas's 7-4 record overall that sees them sitting fifth in their conference standings with two remaining games this season - a clash against third place Texas A&M next week at Memorial Stadium followed closely after another match up versus Houston on Dec. 19th also homecoming game for both teams which will likely be close and exciting contests if these form recent trends continue according to
