Former Philadelphia Flyers winger Chris Pronger announced today that he has signed a contract to join Team Canada for their upcoming match against Sweden in Stockholm on March 15th at the National Hockey Arena. The defenceman, who played alongside current teammates Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin during his tenure with Tampa Bay Lightning before moving overseas last season, is expected to bring a fierce competitive spirit back into Canadian hockey circles where he left after an eventful but ultimately brief stint.

"I'm thrilled to be playing once again in front of the national flag and my family," said Pronger during today'in press conference. "This game means more than just a match—it represents unity among Canadians." 

Chris Pronger played with Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin as well his former Flyers teammate Ray Emery at Tampa Bay Lightning before moving overseas last season where he helped the Avalanche to two Stanley Cups. His decision notably came after a challenging year on international ice for Team Canada that failed in making it past the Round Robin stage of Group C at the 2021 IIHF World Championship, which they hosted and had high hopes attain due largely because of their strong lineup featuring players like Auston Matthews from Calgary.

The news follows Pronger's return to North America after he completed a season with Avalanche in the NHL last year where his impressive defense skills were widely acclaimed by fans and experts alike, but also drew attention when an on-ice fight led police investigations back home amid reports of domestic violence allegations.

In light of recent years' highs and lows for Canadian hockey teams both domestically as well internationally — from disappointing World Championship outcomes to last year’s NHL successes - Pronger is seen by many fans, players alike eagerly await this match with Canada-Sweden.

"Canada has never faced a player like Chris in recent times," said Toronto native and forward Jesse Puljujarvi who spent the offseason playing for Los Angeles Kings alongside fellow Finnish born Pronger during their time together as teammates at Avalanche, "His physical play is legendary. His return to Canadian ice could change our game forever." 

The match on March 15th will be a rematch of the last meeting between these two hockey powerhouses — in Canada where Team USA narrowly defeated its southern neighbors with Pronger notorious fights back then, and now he's ready to bring his combative style against Sweden. The event promises great entertainment for fans at home watching live stream while being broadcast on television across the country during early evening hours of 6 pm Eastern Standard Time (EST).

In response to Pronger’s return in this match, National Hockey League spokesperson said that they respected his decision and were happy with what he brought back into Canada. Meanwhile former defenceman for Team USA Danny Brière expressed concern saying "I'm a proud Canadian myself but I believe Chris should have used the international tournament to work on better relations between our countries instead of jumping straight from controversy overseas, here we are again."

This match is not only about national pride and hockey glory. It also represents hope for both nations that come out as winners or losers at this event; a chance to
