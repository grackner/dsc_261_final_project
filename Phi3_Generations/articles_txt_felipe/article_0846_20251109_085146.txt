A massive fire engulfed an iconic tower in London last night, causing significant damage and raising concerns among experts regarding its structural integrity during this unpredictable winter weather. The historical landmark at Charing Cross Road near Parliament Square was evacuated for safety as authorities work to assess the extent of the blaze that broke out shortly after 6 PM yesterday amid a severe cold spell in Europe.

Reports indicate smoke billowing from one end, and firefigdependent engines struggled against gusty winds tearing through downtown London at around -3°C (27°F). The tower's response to these extreme conditions has raised questions about whether the building can withstand such inclement weather.

"This is unprecedented," said Dr. Emily Turner, a professor of structural engineering from Kingston University who visited London yesterday evening and witnessed the fire firsthand while speaking at an international conference in nearby Heathrow Airport. "Given its age and design features that were meant for milder winters back when it was built over half a century ago."

A spokesperson for The City of London Corporation, responsible for maintaining city landmarks including the tower under question, stated today: 'We're currently assessing whether we need to bring in engineers and safety experts from beyond our own jurisdiction. We don't yet have clear answers on how long it might take before full inspections are conducted.'

As of this afternoon local fire services were still battling the blaze that engulfed over 60% (approx.) total area in its first hour alone, but due to strong winds and cold conditions their efforts seemed impeded. The tower's charred steel skeleton stood out starkly against London’s grey skyline as firefighters worked tirelessly on the scene despite dwindling visibility because of smoke clouds that rose about 15 feet into the air, according to witnesses and local meteorologists alike who confirm this is among worst-ever winter weather seen in England.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan expressed his shock over such an unexpected event stating: 'This incident highlights some important questions we must consider as a city.' He added that further discussions are ongoing with the responsible body to address issues of modernizing historic buildings for extreme climate events, without specifying whether this will include mandatory retrofits.

With thousands having visited nearby attractions throughout winter break in town and more expected visitors over coming weeks when most Londoners return home from holidays abroad - a city often celebrated as resilient against natural disasters – it remains to be seen how locals, tourists alike react once the full extent of fire damage is known. Experts are calling for urgent action in preserving these national treasures before next winter rolls around while ensuring public safety without compromising on history and architectural grandeur that makes London unique globally - a complex issue with no simple answer, it appears at least until further developments unfold within days ahead..
