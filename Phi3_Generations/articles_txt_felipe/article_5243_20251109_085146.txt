An explosion rocked a crowded marketplace in Dhaka, Bangladesh's capital city on Thursday afternoon local time, injuring more than 30 people and causing panic among shoppers according to witness reports filed with the Fire Department. The blast occurred at around 2:15 pm near Gulshan Square when an unidentified device detonated within a stall selling textiles, sending debris flying through the air for about 30 feet in every direction before collapsing to the ground under its own weight and breaking windows nearby.

Fire Chief Mohammad Ali led rescue efforts as his team rushed into harm's way with sirens blaring against a backdrop of screams, cries from victims caught between rubble and shattered glass pieces on their feet while bystanders attempted to help or run away in fear. Police cordoned off the area surrounding Gulshan Square after receiving multiple 911 calls shortly following initial reports about an explosion near a textile stall selling cheap fabrics, which was known as one of Dhaka's most popular spots for bargain shopping among locals and tourists alike.

"The immediate priority is to rescue all survivors still trapped beneath the rubble," said Chief Mohammad Ali who inspected the area with a growing team wearing full protective suits as thick, like hazmat gear against possible remnants of chemical agents from an explosion caused by possibly incendiary devices. "Our rescuers have extensive experience working in situations just like this one but nothing can prepare you for seeing people suffering so much pain and fear."

Witnesses recounted hearing a loud boom that reverberated throughout Gulshan Square, followed closely after by tremors which sent tables crashing down as glass from nearby storefronts shattered into countless fragments. One local vendor in the marketplace said: "I was just about to serve my customers when something exploded next to me causing a huge commotion that made everyone run outside screaming and crying with fear." 

Several bystanders also attempted helping out amid chaos, despite not knowing much beyond seeing some dark smoke billow up from the stall where it all started. One woman in her early thirties spoke of rushing to offer help once she heard shouts for assistance: "I saw people running towards me and immediately dropped everything I had just picked up-helping them get away safely was my only concern," said Ayesha Khan, who claimed that some bystanders tried throwing their jackets or anything they could find in an attempt to smother the flames.

As of now rescuers are still working under difficult conditions trying not to cause further injuries while continuing efforts for a complete evacuation after more than 10 hours since it happened, bringing many Dhaka locals out on streets fearful about what might happen next or how this incident could impact their daily lives in the long run.

"I just want everyone safe and sound," said Chief Ali as he surveyed through binoculars from an observation tower overlooking Gulshan Square, trying to get a bird's-eye view of all that was still inside his team’s rescue area after more than 14 hours since it happened.

The Fire Department is searching for clues on how the explosion came about and has already cordoned off an approximate perimeter around
