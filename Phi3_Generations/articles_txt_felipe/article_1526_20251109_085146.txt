In an unexpected twist of celebrity life, renowned Hollywood actor Michael Thompson was spotted in Las Vegas this past weekend attending a charity event for local schools where he also announced the launch of his own foundation to support educational programs across Nevada (source: The Mirage Entertainment Network). According to sources familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity, Thompson's presence at such gatherings is not out of character given that education advocacy has become a newfound passion for him following his child’ enduring challenges in school.

The event took place last Saturday evening within walking distance from one of the city's most exclusive casinos and was part of an annual fundraiser aimed at raising money to improve Nevada schools, which face financial constraints that impact student learning experiences across various districts (Nevada Department of Education reports). At around 9:30 pm local time, Thompson took center stage with a rousing appeal for support in the Las Vegas Convention Center's auditorium.

"Every child deserves to learn and grow without hindrance," said Michael as he looked at his young son seated next to him onstage. "My foundation intends to ensure this is possible by fundraising directly within communities where it counts the most." His passionate speech was met with applause from both parents present, suggesting that Thompson's efforts are already resonating beyond just personal connections (Nevada Educators Union confirms).

Since his career began in 2014 and became a household name after starring alongside A-list actors in blockbuster movies like "Dune Riders" and sequels, Thompson has remained relatively private about his off-screen life. However, the charitable undertone of this occasion suggests he's embraced more transparency with regards to personal matters which now includes a growing involvement within social causes (CNN celebrity sources comment).

Michael Thompson did not disclose financial goals for the foundation yet expressed his commitment towards its longevity and success. "We aim to make sure no child is left behind, regardless of their zip code or economic background," he stated during a private interview afterward with local reporters (Nevada's charity watchdog organizations note approval).

Fans and Nevada residents are already showing enthusiasm for Thompson’s new endeavor which has brought attention to not just him as an actor but also his humanitarian spirit. In a tweet, one fan expressed support saying "We can count on Michael's heartfelt efforts; he truly cares!"

CNN reporters will continue covering the early days of Thompson’s foundation and are looking forward to seeing its impact over time both for Nevada education and in his career as an actor committed to making a difference (Nevada Education Foundation spokeswoman details plans).
