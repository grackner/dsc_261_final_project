As global athletes prepare for competition in Tokyo this Summer, there's a new team that has been making waves ahead of these Olympic Games: The All-American Women'in Cycling (AAWC). Representing the United States at their first Olympics since its establishment as an independent nation and non-NGB member two years ago on July 23rd, they have arrived in Japan with a sense of pride for representing their country abroad.

Formed by former collegiate athletes who found themselves without clear representation after departing from the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), AAWC has faced numerous challenges and setbacks throughout its brief existence – not least, securing international competition rights normally given to national federations. However, through sheer determination and resilience in pursuing their goal of competing on an Olympic stage; they have succeeded after years spent campaigning with the support from UCI President David Lappartien since 2018 as well as numerous endorsements along the way including a partnership deal struck last year.

In response to this inspiring feat, USA Cycling Federation CEO Danny McDaid expressed his pride: "The success of All-American Women in cycling is an incredible achievement for women's sports and American cyclists as we continue pushing boundaries."

Another source close by also commented on the situation. AAWC president Jane Doe said, “It’s been a tough journey but every bit worthwhile when I see these talented riders representing our great nation.” She emphasized that they are excited to showcase their skills while acknowledging challenges ahead in establishing themselves independently from NCAA-affiliated teams.

With an ambitious roster comprising Olympic medalists, seasoned professional racers and promising juniors alike; AAWC have been training hard since last spring under the watchful eye of head coach John Smith who stated: “It’s crucial that every athlete is not just physically prepared for this challenge but mentally equipped to take on an unpredictable competition.”

The team will compete in road cycling, BMX freestyle and track events at the Tokyo Games. In light of their achievement; they have now joined a select group like British Cycling's Women Only Team (BCTW) who were also invited to join this Olympics after having won multiple medals throughout history since 1984 but previously represented Great Britain as an extension or subgroup under the NGB umbrella.

In contrast, AAWC is entering uncharted territory without a direct affiliation with their home federation making them distinct among other teams yet again showcasing resilience and passion for representing America on such grand stages of competition at these Olympics in Japan this coming August – truly an inspiring tale to follow. 

Now, it's time for all eyes turn toward Tokyo as AAWC prepare once more for the Games where their journey will unfold with every pedal stroke ahead come August 7th when they take part on that historic stage of international competition: The Olympic Cycling Team Trials held in California last week.
