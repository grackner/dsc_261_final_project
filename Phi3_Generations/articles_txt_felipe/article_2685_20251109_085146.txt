Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa is set to make a much-anticipated return for an NFL preseason game this Sunday against the New York Jets at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida (October 5). It will be his first action since suffering a potentially career-ending concussion injury last season. The Dolphins have been eager to get Tagovailoa back into practice following their loss of star quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick earlier this year and hope that the comeback signals promising future for Tua'sen as he adjusts from his previous playing style to a more calculated offense under new head coach Brian Flores.

"Tua is ready to compete again," said senior wideout DeVante Parker, who played with him previously before being waived this year after the Dolphins chose to move on without Fitzpatrick in their system. "He's back stronger than ever and I think he has what it takes to lead our team."

The news comes as Tagovailoa rehabs his neck injury at a Florida-based clinic that specializes in sports injuries, where former players are training him for the fastest recovery possible. Head Physical Therapist Dr. James Smith commented on Tua's condition: "Tua is making significant progress with each session and he has been more committed to his rehabilitation process than we could have imagined."

However, some Dolphins fans still harbor concerns over the potential risk of another concussion episode while being back in practice. Tua's father, Pita Tagovailoa – who is a former NFL safety and played with Miami from 1985-1987 before going on to coach at Notre Dame - shared his worries: "We have done everything possible for him here but still can't help being concerned about another hit. Football has changed drastically in the past few seasons, especially around safety."

The Dolphins’ Athletic Director is determined not only Tua to be fit enough physically and mentally return as soon as he completes his physical tests next week but also ready for him logistically: "We've been preparing since before Ryan left. We have an established system that we believe will give our offense a chance, so long as the player is healthy," said Dan Mulligan.

The Dolphins organization has already taken steps to make adjustments in their strategies and training methods with Tua's return at heart: "We understand he won’t be going out there right now like any other quarterback, but we think his leadership qualities are as strong as ever," Mulligan added.

With preseason games not affecting regular-season standings or playoff seeds and with the Dolphins' season opener just weeks away on September 14 at home against Buffalo Bills, there is a sense of urgency to return Tagovailoa quickly while balancing his health. The team expects Tua back in full training by late next week after passing off-season tests and will be evaluated based on their performances throughout the preseason games as an indication for how well he's ready come regular season time (September).

"The most important thing is that our player comes out healthy first," Flores stressed. "We need to win football matches, but not at any cost."
