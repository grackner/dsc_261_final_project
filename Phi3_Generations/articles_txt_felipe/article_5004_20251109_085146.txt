Topic: Entertainment - Celebrity

In a bold move away from Hollywood norms, international pop sensation Lana Del Rey has decided to withdraw her candidacy for President of America in November elections. In an announcement made on Tuesday at the White House Rose Garden with friends and family by her side, Del Rey expressed that while she loved her country dearly, being a celebrity did not automatically make one fit to lead. "I believe it takes more than fame," said Del Rey as reporters gathered for photos around them after hearing about this surprising decision directly from the singer herself during an imprompt0u interview on live television with White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany, while standing alongside her adoring supporters. "I want to remind everyone that it's not just fame and money but also intelligence, experience, integrity, compassion," added Del Rey who has a degree in fine arts from the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA).

Raised by music-loving parents as they say fueled her passion for songwriting since she was young. Born Laine Randi to Jewish Russian and Italian immigrant grandparents, Lana Del Rey's rise to fame is unquestionable with multiple platinum albums under her belt which also includes a string of hit singles that have earned the singer numerous accolades across several years in music history as she continues evolving from being just an artist into becoming one of America’s most iconic celebrities.

When asked about how this decision came to be, Del Rey shared her reason was due to not only lacking experience but also fear that people would take it lightly and might use the situation for entertainment on social media which she finds disrespectful towards politics - a sentiment echoed by many American citizens. "I respect our democratic process because I believe everyone's voice matters," shared Del Rey who has always been an advocate of using her platform to bring awareness and inspire change in society beyond music industry’s realms as she said during one rally back in 2018, where hundreds gathered at Madison Square Garden listening intently while Lana performed passionately on stage amidst thunderous applause.

Many are left shocked by this move since despite not having any prior political background or public service experience like former Vice President Joe Biden who recently announced his second run for presidency in 2019, Del Rey has built quite a massive career as she once noted herself saying that "music is my true love" during an interview with Rolling Stone Magazine. Politics was always off-limits to her even when growing up and attending UCLA where she studied fine arts alongside taking music courses which led straight into the entertainment industry after graduation, although not without facing criticism from some quarters who claim that it would be better if more celebrities were active in politics since they already have millions of followers worldwide.

Some speculate her decision to withdraw might signal an endorsement for current President Donald Trump whose policies align closely with Del Rey's interests such as promoting national pride and celebrating American culture which has led many supporters on social media platforms sharing their approval through emojis or heart-eyes faces. "I love our country, Lana is an original Dusty Springfield revivalist artist who always reminds us about good old Southern California beauty standards with her gowns and signature haircut while also touching hearts across generations," shared one Trump supporter via Twitter as Del Rey's fan club called for
