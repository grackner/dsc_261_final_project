A massive blizzard swept across New York City yesterday evening into early this morning causing widespdependent cancellations and delays for thousands of commuters in a situation the city's transportation officials are calling "the worst they have ever seen." The relentless storm dumped two feet of snow on parts of Manhattan, forcing major disruptions across public transit systems. Official Mayor Bill De Blasio described it as an unprecedented weather event and urged residents to take necessary precautions when he addressed the city at a press conference yesterday evening just hours after roads started turning into hazardous whiteout conditions from Central Park towards Jersey City, New Jersey along with severe traffic jams in several key areas.

"This is nothing like we've seen before," De Blasio said solemnly while standing beside the city transportation chiefs and meteorologists on live television screens as they showed snow piles reaching up to six feet high near some subway entrances throughout Manhattan; "Our transit systems are down, schools have closed indefinitely due to safety concerns," he continued.

CNN Weather Center Chief Meteorologist Dr. Jenna Harper confirmed that blizzard conditions were expected to last through the weekend with a significant chance of thawing followed by more snowfall on Monday morning as she briefed viewers at CNN Headquarters this afternoon: "What we're dealing with now is not just an ordinary winter storm; it carries enough moisture and energy that could easily lead into severe wind chill factors, potentially breaking several city records."

The New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) reported thousands of delays across all transit modes - buses have been reduced by 25% while subway service has come to a near standstill due in large part because many key personnel cannot make it into work amid the weather warnings. Accordingly, MTA CEO Craig Coughlin issued an apology for their "inability to meet riders' needs right now" and assured commuters that they are working around-the-clock on snow removal efforts across all stations but cautioned against leaving vehicles parked overnight if possible as street clearing progresses extremely slow due, in part because many salt supplies have also been compromised.

As residents hunker down indoors and officials issue further advisories to remain off the streets until at least tomorrow morning when conditions are forecasted to improve slightly with a slight warming trend expected by Wednesday afternoon; "The New York City Department of Transportation has called in emergency crews, but clearing snow-covered roads remains an ongoing battle," DOT Commissioner Kamran Chowdhury said while touring heavily hit areas today and pledging additional support for all affected citizens.

Community centers throughout Manhattan have been opened as temporary warming stations offering shower facilities, hot foods, blankets to stranded travelers who were hoping their commute would get better tomorrow morning when schools resume on Wednesday after the weekend break; "I've never seen anything like this in my entire life. It feels very eerie," said one resident of Midtown East while standing outside Central Park with several others shivering and waiting for an update regarding their ride back home next Thursday morning as they continue to brave these extreme weather conditions without knowing if that will ever happen."
