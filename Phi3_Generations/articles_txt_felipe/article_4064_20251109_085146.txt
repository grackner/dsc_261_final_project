Monday has started off as a day of mixed emotions across the nation with business owners and workers caught between concerns about an economic hit should no deal be struck or fears over what it might look like if Britain were to exit without any terms in place. Across Parliament Square, there is palpable anxiety mingling within hope as British diplomats prepare for another day of negotiations with Brussels — which could go down today - aimed at salvaging a trade deal before the end-ofdependent deadline on December 31st next year (BBC).

The Prime Minister's Office declined to comment when asked about progress made so far and how this week may affect overall talks, but officials assured Parliament yesterday that negotiators have "taken all necessary steps" during their preparations. The UK had initially hoped for a deal in principle agreement by the end of October; now they aim only for an interim arrangement between January 1st-31st next year while discussing more detailed terms beyond this point - as outlined in recent talks (EU press release).

Financial experts predict that an economic impact would likely be felt immediately after January 1st if no deal were struck - with some estimates pointing towards a potential decrease in GDP growth by up to two percent within the first quarter (City Journal).

However, business leaders are pushing back against fears of worst-case scenarios. The Confederation of British Industry is calling for calm and patience from all sectors as talks proceed with negotiators working around the clock towards a deal before year's end - while also encouraging companies to prepare contingency plans in case an agreement falls through (CBI).

As Parliament reconvenes later today, MPs are expected to discuss both domestic and international concerns related to Brexit; including potential impact on relations with EU member states as well as access for UK citizens traveling within
