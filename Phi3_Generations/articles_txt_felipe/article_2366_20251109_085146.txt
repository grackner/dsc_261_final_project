In a remarkable display of nature's force, an unprecedented weather phenomenon hit Louisiana last Thursday evening as powerful wind speeds reached up to 105 mph in St. Mary Parish (CNN). The event brought significant structural damage and led authorities into action with search-and-rescue operations still ongoing a week later, according to the local National Weather Service office's latest updates this Monday.


"We've never seen anything like it," said meteorologist Dr. Elizabeth Harding at LSU Hurricane Research Lab in Baton Rouge, who added that atmospheric pressure readings were unusually low before landfall but the reason behind such intensity remains under investigation by scientists worldwide. 


Several towns within a radius of about 50 miles from Bay St. Louis bore witness to this hurricane's strength as it made contact with Louisiana's warm waters on Wednesday afternoon before veering inland just past sunset, reports local weather correspondent David Sánchez for the DailyMail Live blog.


"The damage was extensive," said Mayor Ronald Boudreaux of St. Mary Parish after surveying his community early Thursday morning post-storm when he reported 80% power outages across town and an estimated $15 million in damages to infrastructure, according to the latest figures released by Louisiana's Emergency Management Agency (LEMA).


Emergency services launched a massive response effort that saw over 2,000 personnel deployed for rescue operations immediately following landfall. Volunteers and first responders worked through Friday night into Saturday with only marginal improvements in power restoration by Sunday morning as they continue to recover from the catastrophic weather event (DailyMail).


Officials have warned that while skies cleared up on Monday, there is still a long road ahead for full recovery and community support. The Red Cross estimates over 10,000 households are displaced with more than half of those in the hardest-hit areas requiring temporary shelter (CNN).


"This was not something we could prepare ourselves against," said Boudreaux to CNN News on Monday about rebuilding efforts. "We'll need all hands, hearts and minds as a community going forward."
