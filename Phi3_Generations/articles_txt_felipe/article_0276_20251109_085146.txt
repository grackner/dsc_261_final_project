Downtner Inn, a once-popular bed and breakfast in rural Pennsylvania, has faced financial turmoil for years due to declining tourism numbers since local factories closed decades ago (December 2023). Now under new management with the promise of revitalization, this historic inn hopes to recapture its lost glory.

Nestled among picturesque farmlands just outside Williamsport — an area renowned for outdoor activities and family-friendly attractions like Wildwood Lake Park (former factory town turned sports hub)—the Downtner Inn has struggled with a mix of aging facilities, competition from modern chain hotels offering luxurious amenities at lower prices, and the recent economic downturn.

New proprietor Sarah Johnson purchased the inn last year after extensive research into revitalizing small bed-and-breakfast businesses throughout America (CNNMoney). "I fell in love with this place; it has so much character," she said at a press conference held on Tuesday, November 10.

Downtner Inn was built circa 1830 and originally housed local families before transforming into an affordable lodging option for travelers heading to the Poconos Mountains (a popular region offering ski resorts like Bear Mountain), attractions such as bustling arts festivals in Williamsport, or even historic sites dating back hundreds of years.

According to city officials, Downtner Inn was once one of three bed-and-breakfast establishments providing lodging services within a five-mile radius (source: City Directory). But over time many hotels opened up outside downtown Williamsport while the local factory industry shifted towards tourism and service sectors instead. "There's still an untapped market here for those seeking unique, locally owned accommodations that truly reflect our town," said Deputy Mayor Thomas Harris (CNNMoney).

Sarah Johnson is bringing a fresh approach to Downtner Inn by updating guest rooms while preserving their historic charm. She plans on incorporating sustainable practices and emphasizing local products in her new menu items as well, such as using locally-sourced organic fruits for breakfast offerings or offering special deals partnering with nearby vineyards (CNNMoney).

"It's all about reconnecting people to the area through hospitality," Johnson said. "We want guests not only staying at Downtner Inn but also supporting local businesses as they explore downtown Williamsport and beyond." 

A representative from Pennsylvania Tourism, Mary Connors, commended Sarah's initiative while adding her organization is working to promote regional tourism more widely. "As we focus on reinvigorating our statewide economy by supporting small businesses like Downtner Inn," said Connors (CNNMoney).

Downtner Inn has started attracting guests who appreciate the uniqueness of historic bed-and-breakfast accommodations, offering a more authentic and personalized travel experience.

Local residents have expressed enthusiasm for the revitalization project after witnessing years of decline firsthand; however, some worry about gentrification and loss of affordability for local families who previously relied on rent from guests staying at the inn. "We
