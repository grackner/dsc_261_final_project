A powerful nor'easter brought a historic snowstorm to Boston on March 15th, with record-breaking accumulations that left thousands stranded and disrupted the city for days. The National Weather Service reported more than two feet of snowfall in some areas around Jamaica Plain neighborhoods by late afternoon hours Wednesday evening into Thursday morning.

Boston Mayor Michelle Wu said during a press conference, "We've never seen anything like this before; our city is resilient and united." As she surveyed the whiteout conditions outside City Hall, her determination to see Boston through these trying times was evident among officials across departments working together as one.

Commuters were told not to travel Wednesday morning when a snow emergency was declared at 9:30 am EDT on Route One in Cambridge towards the Massachusetts Turnpike due to extreme weather conditions rendering roads impassable and unsafe for driving; meandependent officials emphasized that motorists should use mass transit or avoid unnecessary trips.

Meteorologists from ABC News explain, "The strength of this storm was unprecedented given its location over the Atlantic Ocean coupled with a strong high-pressure system blocking other weather systems." This combination led to frigid temperatures and wind gusts exceeding 50mph in some areas.

Residents like Sue Thompson, who lives on Beacon Hill where she says several inches had already accumulated by early afternoon Wednesday before things only got worse from thereon out "It's been hellish," adds the mother of three as piles stretch up to 6ft high outside her home. At Boston Medical Center which reported a surge in snow-related injuries, chief medical officer Dr. John Connor says they are treating mostly fractures and hypothermia cases but he reassured that patients can expect full recovery with proper care stating "our team is up to the challenge".

Several shelters opened across Boston overnight providing accommodation for those without heat or power, according to Mayor Wu's office who noted many elderly citizens and families displaced during this extreme weather event. The city mobilized thousands of snow removal equipment workers working round-the-clock clearing critical routes like hospitals access roads along with residential streets where it deemed most necessary for people stuck inside their homes unable to safely leave due to deep drifts blocking cars from even moving an inch off the ground which has forced a citywide curfew between 9pm and 5am.

Governor Charlie Baker urged residents throughout Massachusetts not only Boston area but all of New England as well "we must come together during times like these" he implored via Twitter last night evening while adding it's crucial people stay home unless absolutely necessary or they risk serious danger due to treacherous driving conditions caused by the heavy snowfall; Baker himself is seen in a video briefing from his State House office wearing thick woolen clothes, gloves and hat as he addresses reporters outside alongside other officials working on relief efforts.

As for what's coming next after an extended period of cold weather conditions which can cause further complications such as frozen pipes within homes; experts advise homeowners should insulate exposed sections where running water lines enter the house at exterior walls using specialized materials like pipe sleeves that offer better protection against freezing temperatures while authorities remind everyone to stay vigilant and be prepared for potentially more
