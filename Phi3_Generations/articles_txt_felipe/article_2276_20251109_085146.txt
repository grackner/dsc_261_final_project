A new study has found that a lack of sleep may increase the risk of heart disease and strokes by as much as twice compared to those who enjoy full night's rest. The researchers examined over five million individuals in Japan, with findings suggesting consistent shortage of shut-eye can lead to significant health deterioration starting from middle age onwards (Health Daily News).

Dr. Hiroshi Tanaka, the leading cardiologist who spearheaded this investigation into sleep deprivation and heart disease risks, warned that if one were not getting enough rest even once in a while, they might as well be living with insomnia (CNN Health News). The study's findings also indicated an alarming trend of disrupted nocturnal activities leading to obesity and diabetes.

"People need at least seven hours sleep for their health; less than that starts increasing the risks substantially," said Tanaka (Health Daily News). He added, "It's not just about quantity but also quality of rest." The study took into account factors such as age, sex and lifestyle habits.

In addition to Dr. Tanaka’this investigation has led him to call for further research in this field with a push towards national sleep guidelines (CNN Health News). "It is high time that we pay more attention on the importance of good quality rest," he said, pointing out how often society undervalues proper slumber as an essential aspect of healthy living.

According to Dr. Tanaka's research: 60% of people aged between 35 and 49 in Japan do not get enough sleep; this increases by a quarter among those over the age of 65 (Health Daily News). These findings come at an alarming time as recent surveys show that Japanese adults are averaging around six hours per night, well below recommended levels.

Experts caution that while genetics may play a role in sleep disorders such as insomnia or obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), the majority of these cases can be addressed with lifestyle changes and medical intervention if diagnosed early enough (CNN Health News). "Sometimes, simple solutions like adjusting one's daily routine or using a comfortable pillow are all it takes," said Dr. Reiko Sato, an expert in sleep disorders at Tokyo University of Medical Science.

"However, for those who have chronic conditions exacerbating their lack of quality rest - such as anxiety and depression - professional help is advised to establish a tailored approach towards therapy," Dr. Tanaka stressed (CNN Health News). These findings highlight the importance of seeking medical advice if one experiences persistent sleep problems or feels tired after minimal shut-eye time each night, he cautioned: "Do not dismiss this as 'just an occasional lack of rest' since it can lead to long term health complications."

The study was conducted by Japan's National Institute of Sleep and Neurological Disease (JISND), with funding from the Japanese government, on 5.4 million people aged between five and ninety years old who had participated in nationwide sleep-related surveys since 1980. Data collected included physical examinations, interviews regarding nightly routines and lifestyle choices as well as self-reported levels of rest (JISND).
