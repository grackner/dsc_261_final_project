A powerful storm system unleashed heavy rainfall and wind across a swath of Midwestern states this weekend, leaving at least three people dead and causing widespstatic flooding that disrupted transportation networks in cities like Des Moines and Minneapolis. Reports indicated the severe weather event began on Saturday morning with gusts reaching up to 58 mph (93 km/h), as per National Weather Service data, quickly escalating into a full-blown deluge by early Sunday afternoon that forced several evacuations and led one local resident of Sioux City, Iowa, described the streets turning treacherous.

“It was like driving on an ocean,” said 72-year-old Martha Jenkins as she recounted her experience to a reporter after managing to navigate out of town with just minutes warning before roads became impassable due to rising water levels, per witness accounts collected by CNN meteorologists.

The storm dumped more than two feet (0.6 meters) of rain in some areas over the course of 24 hours and winds reached gale force at times during what local officials are calling a once-in-a-generation event, disrupting services across transport networks including flights being canceled by American Airlines from Chicago O'Hare International Airport.

The sudden onset caught many residents off guard; several who were in their homes said they had not heard warnings over the radio or television until water levels began rising swiftly through doorways and windows, forcing them to take immediate action for safety reasons as local meteorologists from The Weather Channel rushed out with updates.

“It was truly unexpected,” commented Dr. Jennifer Lee, a senior researcher at the University of Iowa’s Department of Earth Sciences who has spent her career studying weather patterns in Midwestern states like Iowa and Minnesota where flooding risks are high due to its geography near major river basins that flow northward towards Lake Michigan before turning east through Wisconsin then into Ontario.

“In all my years analyzing data, I’ve never seen this kind of rapid escalation from light rainfall,” Dr. Lee shared while speaking on the situation with a CNN meteorologist during an interview in her office at Iowa City where she studies historical weather events across several states using computer models and satellite images to predict future developments like these storms based upon patterns observed over decades of data collection efforts by researchers such as herself globally.

While flood warnings had been issued early Friday morning, local officials in cities including Des Moines; Omaha or Nebraska's capital city where some suburbs experienced flash-flooding incidents leading to evacuations of low-lying areas due mainly because these neighborhoods are built near the Niobrara River which flows northward across state lines before draining into Missouri Basin and ultimately reaching Gulf Coast waters; Minneapolis, St. Paul or Minnesota's capital city with its lakeshore communities also experiencing high wind events causing damage to outdoor structures like gazebos while floodwaters encroached onto streets near the Mississippi River which divides Chicago into a northern and southern sections before draining southward across Canada toward Mexico’s Gulf Coast waters, most residents heeded warnings issued by local officials as well.

“I knew something wasn't right because I woke up with dark clouds looming overhead,” said 45-year-old businessman Michael Thompson who was on his way to
