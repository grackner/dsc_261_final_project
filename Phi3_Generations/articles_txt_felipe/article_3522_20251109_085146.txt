PHILADELPHIA — The Philadelphia Eagles celebrated a hard-fought victory in the NFC Championship Game at their home stadium on January 21, marking an exhilarating end to Super Bowl LII preparations. Trailing by just three points with minutes remaining, quarterback Carson Wentz led his team from behind against the reigning champions New England Patriots before coming back and rallying them into a stunning upset win of 16–13 in front of their roaring home crowd after a late surge following an interception returned for a touchdown by cornerback Ronald Darby.

As night fell on the city, Eagles' fans were treated to one thrilling end-around play that resulted in quarterback Wentz scampering into open space and throwing back downfield without breaking stride or taking his eyes off the receiver for an astonishing 40 yards before being met head-on by a Patriots defender, but he managed to get through with just enough wriggle room. The Eagles' defense then sealed their fate as running back Miles Sanders scored from nine yards out on the next play after Wentz found him in traffic and threw for only 30 airy yards before being picked up by a Patriots safety, but he managed to escape with an easy score. The crowd of over sixty thousand roared into rapturous applause as their team secured victory celebrations while the Patriots fans could do little more than murmurs and muffled boos in defeat.

"It's a dream come true," Wentz said after being lifted off his feet by two different Eagles players before falling back down to be congratulated at midfield, "This means the world for all of us." Coach Doug Pederson praised them saying: "Our team played with heart and resilience. We gave it our all out there today".

The Patriots' coach Bill Belichick was visibly shaken after hearing about his team’s loss, stating on the sidelines at halftime that they knew how to win but not against a defense like Eagles'. Their star quarterback Tom Brady had three touchdown passes in as many attempts with only one interception. Despite their efforts and stats-breaking performances by players such as tight end Hunter Henry, who set career highs receiving 12 targets for two scores, the Patriots couldn't find an edge over Eagles’ relentless defense that held them to just ten points overall despite New England being up until late in regulation.

"Our special teams unit continues its dominance," said Eagles defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz post-game, pointing out the team's return of an interception for a touchdown as critical on this day while also crediting them with three blocked kicks and five quarterback sacks.

This win sets up Philadelphia to face the Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl LIII two weeks later at their home stadium where they’re expected by odds makers like Caesars Sportsbook, which had given Eagles an 8-2 shot of winning it outright compared to New England's just below even chances after this game.
