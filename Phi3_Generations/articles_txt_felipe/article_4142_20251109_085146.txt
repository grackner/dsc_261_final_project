A recent study conducted by Johns Hopkins University reveals a potential breakthrough in Alzheimer'selk treatment using stem cells derived from human amniotic fluid. The researchers found that transplanting these lab-grown neurons into the brains of patients with early-stage Alzheimer's can help improve their memory and cognitive function for up to two years after surgery, according to results published today in Nature Medicine.

Researcher Dr. Elizabeth Thompson said: "We are witnessing a remarkable development that could change lives across the globe." The study took place at Johns Hopkins' prestigious Brain Research Center located just outside Baltimore where 12 patients with early-stage Alzheimer's disease received injections of amniotic stem cells harvested from placental tissue and cultured into neurons.

These individuals underwent a delicate two-hour procedure lasting three months over the past year, which involved drilling small holes within their skulls to place these lab-created nerve fibers directly near damaged areas of the brain responsible for memory formation and retrieval - hippocampus. While it is too soon to claim a complete cure, many patients experienced significant improvement in daily activities that demand mental agility such as remembering names or following directions while performing chores around their homes according to Dr. James Greenwood who led the study team alongside Thompson: "In some cases memory function has improved so much after surgery our loved ones were able return back into full-time employment".

However, there are potential risks associated with this innovative procedure which include infection and bleeding postoperatively but these instances occurred less than 1% of the time throughout trials conducted at Johns Hopkins University's Brain Research Center led by Greenwood. "We do understand that every surgery carries some risk, however we believe it is worth taking because life after Alzheimer can be very difficult for both sufferers and their families," stated Dr. Thompson emphasizing the importance of continued research before such a treatment becomes widely available: 
"Currently our focus rests on expanding this study size to include more patients while working closely with FDA officials who are actively reviewing these results in hopes of accelerating approval procedures once all necessary data sets have been collected." The next phase for the team at Johns Hopkins University involves a larger clinical trial which will take place overseas as well and continue testing this groundbreaking treatment that offers hope not only to patients with Alzheimer's but also their families.
