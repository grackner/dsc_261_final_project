Flooding in Queensland has left over a thousand homes underwater following torrential rain that hit south-east Australia last weekend. In what is being described as one of the most devastating floods to strike this part of the country, up to 20 inches (51cm) of rainfall was recorded in just hours by meteorologists on Saturday evening at Townsville's main weather station located near Palm Beach.

The severe downpour caught many residents off-guard and led to widespdisruption as the Brisbane River swelled beyond its banks, overflowing into residential areas in North Queensland townships including Beenleigh and Logan City. The Bureau of Meteorology has issued a flash flood warning for affected regions that is set to remain in effect through Tuesday evening at least due to forecasted continued rainfall which may further swell river levels, with some parts expected to see up to another 10 inches (25cm) this week.

In Beenleigh alone, dozens of streets are underwater and scores more could be compromised as the floodwaters make their way downstream towards Sydney Bay where thousands live alongside businesses vital for regional commerce along the Logan River which runs through several suburbs before emptying into Brisbane. Police have issued evacuation orders but some residents, like 62-year old Margaret Simpson and her husband John both refuse to leave their homes despite being advised by emergency workers that they face imminent danger: "We've been here for over forty years - this town has always survived floods before so why should we panic now?" said Ms. Simpson while holding onto hope amidst the rising waters around her property; she added later, however, “The water’s gotten really close to our doorstep and I am concerned about when it'll start coming into the house."

CNN reports that local authorities are struggling with limited resources as they work tirelessly alongside floodwater rescue crews attempting evacuation operations amid ongoing rainfall. Logan City Mayor Jenny Talent expressed her distress at how quickly things escalated: “We initially thought it would be bad but this is something I've never seen before,” she stated during an interview yesterday with local ABC radio reporters who were also seeking refuge in a nearby hotel after arriving on the scene earlier that day, "Our priority now must to ensure everyone’s safety and support those affected through these difficult times."

A flood management expert from Griffith University commented: “These types of events are becoming more common as global weather patterns change. We need a long-term plan with both local communities understanding their risks in such disaster situations while also ensuring authorities have the resources necessary to prepare for, and respond quickly when faced with these emergencies.”

The Australian Red Cross has mobilized volunteers across impacted regions offering immediate relief services including providing blankets, food, bottled water along evacuation shelters established at local schools such as Taringa State High School that opened its doors to displaced residents overnight last weekend. However with emergency workers already stretched thin due to a massive bushfire crisis gripping the west and north of Australia simultaneously ongoing this year, authorities say they are pleading for international help in managing these disasters concurrently: “We have never seen anything like it," said Brisbane Lord Mayor Graham Quirk yesterday.
