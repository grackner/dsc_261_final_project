On Wednesday night at Madison Square Garden in New York City, an exciting playoff basketball game between teams from Boston and Brooklyn took a turn for the unexpected as both players were ejected simultaneously due to on-court altercations that quickly escalated into violence. The dispute started when star player Jordan Harris of the Bruins challenged point guard Kyle Brown's refereeing call late in the third quarter, leading to an intense back and forth between teammates as well as players from both sides attempting to break up heated disagreements on court before matters took a dangerous turn.

CNN New York Bureau Chief Mike Sestak reports that while tensions had been high throughout tonight's game already, witnesses say things reached boiling point in the final minutes of play between two players who are well-known rivals within their respective teams - both have won MVP awards and hold longtime records for steals.

In a baffling move that has left fans across New York reeling with disbelief, officials ejected Jordan Harris from the game at 10:52 PM EDT before pulling Kyle Brown off of the court just five minutes later as fights broke out between teammates on both sides. The commotion quickly drew security guards and additional staff into play to help restore order in what has become an increasingly rowdy atmosphere, said officials who spoke privately after Sunday night’s game with no immediate comment from either of the two teams or franchises involved yet public statements have been made by a few members.

“It was just something you didn't want your kids to see,” says local spectator Jennifer Smith as she watches her three young children on hand after hearing about incident reports coming in during halftime break between both teams, “I’m not sure if they knew what it would lead up too.”

According to officials interviewed by the New York DailyMail Sports Desk and players themselves (who are seeking their own statements for public release but have yet been heard from), two former college teammates found a way of continuing rivalry outside basketball without first realizing how quickly things would spiral out-of-control due to misunderstandings leading back into the game.

“They thought they were just having fun with each other, when in reality it was disrespectful,” says college player Kevin Jackson about his former teammate now playing on Boston's roster and fellow MVP award winner Daniel Brown who plays for Brooklyn but is also a graduate of the same school as Jackson.

“It all started over an argument at home after one night’s bar-tastic celebration that led to misunderstandings, unintended taunting during games among friends on both teams which then escalated into more than just disrespect - it turned heated,” adds Daniel Brown as the two sit down for separate interviews.

“This kind of confrontational attitude between players isn’t new in our league but when fans start to feel unsafe or concerned about their safety while coming out on court then something needs an immediate fix.” Says NBA commissioner Adam Silver who has been requested by teams involved since the incident occurred, he says all parties are being cooperative thus far as well.

Sources say both players were ejected and could face fines or even suspension depending upon league disciplinary review of video evidence along with other penalties which have not yet been decided for final disposition by NBA officials but will be issued to their respective teams if found
