In a remarkable turn of events at this year's Women'in World Cup Final in Lyon on Saturday afternoon, Liverpool FC faced Manchester United with an unprecedented match where neither side could score despite the game stretching into extra time. As the final whistle blew after two full hours without goals following normal play and additional 30 minutes of overtime at the Groupama Arena, it left fans questioning if this will be remembered as a magical non-goal or simply an uncharacteristic draw in women's soccer history.

The pitch was set ablaze with anticipation yesterday evening when Liverpool drew Manchester United to start their group stage fixture on Thursday night at 20:30 CET local time, hoping for a triumphant win but instead finding themselves locked into another enthralling encounter that saw both teams exhibiting strong defensive tactics. The referee initially gave the match full ten minutes of additional playtime after normal injury-time elapsed without scoring from either side before resorting to penalties as an alternative decision, much like what happened in previous encounters between these two fierce rivals but never quite reaching this level of impasse within a single game.

Despite the lackluster scoreline at 0-0 and with each team standing strong defensively from start to finish during normal play as well throughout extra time, coaches on both sides acknowledged their unparalleled display in soccer history while also admitting that it might not be indicative of future performances. Liverpool head coach Phil Patterson remarked at the post-match press conference held backstage beside his team's bench inside Groupama Arena after exiting through its main entrance: "This was a unique match, and our players showed great discipline in front of goal as well."

Echoing similar sentiments came from Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer who addressed reporters alongside his team later that day during their journey back to the airport for departures on Aer Lingus Flight 123. "We knew we had a tough game ahead of us," he said, acknowledging Liverpool's unbeaten record in Champions League qualifiers dating back to March this year while also expressing gratitude towards their players and coaches: "I commend our team for staying focused throughout the match despite no goals being scored by either side. We look forward to facing them again."

Both teams will face off against each other once more during Round 3, which is scheduled take place on Friday night at the Groupama Arena in Lyon with local time of 20:45 CET where Liverpool FC and Manchester United must find a way around this peculiar draw scenario to prove themselves among top contenders for European glory.

As spectators grapple with how such an event could even happen, one expert on women's soccer tactics has weighed in regarding the uncommon occurrence: Dr. Emily Jones, professor of Sports Science at Oxford University and former Women's FA player comments that although it may be considered rare within men’s leagues as well given their tendency towards higher scoring matches than what is seen often on women-led fields for various reasons including tactical play style differences or simply due to the competitiveness level of individual teams at this specific time.

Despite these unexpected developments during one of football's most celebrated tournaments, fans across Europe continue showing unwavering support and passionate cheers each match day as both Liverpool FC & Manchester United
