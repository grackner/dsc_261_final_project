Topic: Style - Beauty

A beauty influencer is sparking controversy in Los Angeles this week by turning away clients who don't adhere to conventional gender presentations and expressions. Alex Jordan, a prominent local hairstylist with over five years of experience known for transformative looks, announced the new policy on social media last Thursday evening after facing backlash from their usual clientele concerned about inclusivity in beauty spaces.

"I've always been an advocate for diversity and self-expression," said Jordan during a live discussion with followers earlier this weekend. "But as I grow, so does my understanding of who needs to feel welcome at our salon."

The new policy has divided the LGBT+ community in Los Angeles which prides itself on being an inclusive city for all identities and expressions. Some see Jordan's decision as a step towards making beauty spaces more comfortable for people with non-binary or genderqueer presentations, while others view it as gatekeeping by someone who does not understand the spectrum of human expression in its entirety.

"It feels like Alex is shutting down an open door," said Morgan Smith (pseudonym), a longtime client and LGBT+ activist from downtener Los Angeles, "The beauty industry should cater to everyone."

Jordan has since hosted workshops on non-binary representation in the fashion world but continues to face criticism over whether these initiatives go far enough. Some see this as a positive step towards progressive changes within traditional spaces while others believe that more radical approaches are necessary, citing Jordan's recent comments about transgender individuals needing "more help" than cisgender clients during consultations and appointments at the salon.

The incident came amidst growing conversations around inclusivity across industries in Los Angeles with advocates calling for change after numerous reports of discrimination based on gender identity, race or sexuality surfaced over recent months. The city's reputation as a safe haven has come under scrutiny prompting calls from community leaders and organizations like the Southern California LGBTQ+ Alliance to re-evaluate policies across sectors including beauty salons where clients often feel comfortable expressing themselves freely without fear of judgement or exclusion.

"This isn't about creating divisions," said Taylor Lee, co-founder of Rainbow Faces Clinic which provides inclusive services for transgender individuals and queer people in Los Angeles.", "It's essential that spaces like this are welcoming to everyone so they can feel safe expressing their authentic selves."

Moving forward would require Jordan - who has over 50,000 social media followers - as well the wider beauty industry to engage more deeply with these conversations and listen carefully without judgment. "It's time for all of us in this field to reflect on how our actions affect those around us," Lee added before concluding their thoughts about a broader shift within society towards acceptance, understanding that progress often comes through dialogue rather than unilateral decisions made by individuals with influence over public discourse. 

Jordan has pledged to continue learning and listening but maintains the belief in setting boundaries for professional conduct at their salon while recognizing its unique position as a creative hub within Los Angeles' diverse communities where conversations about gender are increasingly mainstreamed through art, music and fashion - something they hope will ultimately inspire further growth towards genuine inclusivity.
