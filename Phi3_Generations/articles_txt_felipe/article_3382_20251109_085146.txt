Health experts warn that despite national efforts to encourage fitness among American teenagers, a new report suggests they are becoming more inactive than ever before. The study found significant declines in physical activity levels over the past two decenkades and links this sedentary lifestyle to rising rates of obesity and other health issues across schools nationwide as reported by CNN Health on Thursday, October 15th.

In a comprehensive survey conducted among students from various public high schools in New York City, researchers discovered that physical education classes are being underutilized with only half the teenagers participating regularly. The decline is consistent across other major cities like Los Angeles and Chicago according to data collected by the Centers for Disease Control between 1990-2020.

Dr. Samantha Rowe, lead researcher at Columbia University Medical Center's Department of Pediatrics says, "The decrease in physical activity among teenagers is alarming and correlates strongly with poor health outcomes including obesity." Experts speculate that an increase in screen time combined with less access to parks or recreational facilities contributes largely towards this trend.

"Technology has become the go-to solution for entertainment among teenagers," says Dr. Rowe, noting a significant shift from outdoor activities such as sports and cycling during her 20 years of practice in pediatric healthcare at Mount Sinai Hospital NYC starting back in April 2021. She adds that changes to dietary habits also play a crucial role: "Increasing consumption of fast food is another significant contributor."

The American Heart Association released similar findings last month, highlighting the need for immediate intervention by local governments and community organizations across all states but with special focus on underserved urban communities. A spokesperson from this organization confirmed plans to launch a series nationwide campaigns aimed at improving physical fitness through fun activities like dance workshops and sports clinics scheduled throughout 2022, in addition to educational programs about the importance of regular exercise for teenagers' health on school campuses.

Further efforts by non-profit organizations offering free or low-cost accessibility to fitness classes have shown promising results within New York City alone since January this year when funding increased due to a generous donation from prominent philanthropist and avid cyclist, John McNealy. "This investment has been instrumental in creating positive changes among local youths," says Liz Smith, the director of 'Healthy Youth' non-profit organization who worked closely with schools across Brooklyn to implement cycling clubs on school premises within just six months after securing this donation.

With these collective efforts and continued awareness among parents, educators, healthcare professionals as well as teenagers themselves about the importance of maintaining an active lifestyle from a young age; experts hope to reverse current trends in national youth fitness levels over time by 2030.

"We need everyone's support," says Dr. Rowe, "not just government bodies but also communities and families themselves." The first step starts with education on the risks of a sedentary lifestyle combined with accessible facilities for physical activity right in their neighborhood schools starting from this fall to encourage teenagers back into sports clubs or even forming interest groups like hiking
