A sudden surge in demand for electric vehicles has caused a spike in prices across Europe overnight as dealers scramble to keep up with orders. The unexpected rush came on Wednesday when Germany announced plans to phase out gasoline and diesel cars by the year 2035, fueling excitement about cleaner transportation options among environmentally conscious consumers.

Dealerships in Berlin reported that prices for popular EV models like Tesla's Model Y have risen upwards of $1,000 within hours since news broke out around midday on Wednesday due to limited stock and soaring interest levels among buyers seeking eco-friendly alternatives. "We never saw anything quite this fast," said Lars Müller, manager at Berlin's Green Wheels Car Market.

Müller added that he had received over 50 inquiries about EV options since the announcement was made by Germany Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy Robert Habeck earlier today but only enough vehicles to satisfy half of these requests were available on hand at his store's inventory, which left customers facing steep price hikes.

Electric vehicle manufacturers are struggling as well: Volkswagen CEO Oliver Blume said that the company has been trying its best "to ramp up production and secure more batteries" while keeping prices competitive to avoid losing ground in this rapidly growing market segment, but his confidence seemed unsure when asked if VW was able to meet current demand.

Industry experts are warning about possible long-term repercussions of these price surges on both businesses and consumers: "We're currently seeing a temporary disruption in the electric vehicle market due to this unexpected spike in demand," said Dr. Maria Klein, Director for EV Analytics at Berlin University of Economics and Business Studies last Thursday during an economic forum discussing sustainable transportation trends across Europe organized by Deutsche Bank & Co.. "But if we don't take steps now to address this imbalance in supply chains as well as educate consumers about their options, such price spikes could become more common and permanently disrupt the growth of a crucial industry for our future."

In response to these developments today (Friday), Minister Habeck called on manufacturers working with his government's green initiatives plan - "Electro-Mobility 2.0" -to expedite efforts in increasing output while maintaining affordability: "It is essential that we ensure our customers are not priced out of this promising sector," he said during a press conference on Wednesday evening, urging companies to avoid exploiting demand by charging exorbitant prices.

Several EV manufacturers quickly assured the government they're doing everything possible to address concerns about access and affordability: Mercedes-Benz Group AG CEO Ashok Ashokwaria today issued a statement saying, "We understand our customers are eager for greener transportation options; hence we pledge not only to meet this demand but also aim at keeping prices within reach. We're expanding production capacity and investing more into R&D with the goal of achieving sustainable growth."

Müller from Green Wheels Car Market echoed his sentiments about consumers wanting affordable EV options: "We share Minister Habeck’s vision for a greener future, but we also urge car manufacturers to provide
