During a sold-out charity screening of "Avengers: Endgame" at Los Angeles' iconic Kodak Theatre on Sunday evening, an unprecedented incident occurred when the sound system abruptly shut down halfway through Tuesday Night Football. Over two thousand movie and sports fans were left in a state of confusion as they waited for hours before any explanations surfaced.

As night fell over Los Angeles, eager moviegoers made their way to the historic Kodak Theatre on March 15th — anticipating an unforgettable evening immersing themselves into Avengers' world and witness a much-nedependent high-definition broadcast of Tuesday Night Football. "I was really looking forward to this; I think everyone here is too," said one regular patron, Jillian Baker from Los Angeles suburb of Van Nuys as she stood in line before the event started at 7:00 p.m PT.

However, shortly after two hours into the movie when most guests had been treated to an uninterrupted run-time on Avengers and were preparing for football kickoff, a sudden power outage occurred across half of Kodak Theatre's seating capacity that resulted in cutting off audio from "Avengers: Endgame." The screen remained blank while the venue buzzed with murmurs.

"This is certainly not what we expected," said an exasperated event coordinator, Mark Robinson who had just finished announcing via microphone before hearing nothing but silence after his voice faded away inaudibly to thousands of disappointed fans. "We are working on it and hope things get back up soon."

As hours passed with no resolution or clear communication from the management about what was going on, people's frustration started mounting as they shared their experiences on social media platforms such as Twitter where hashtags like #KodakPowerOutage began trending. 

One particularly vocal attendee and Tuesday Night Football fanatic Chris Rodriguez from Los Angeles said he was "deeply upset not only because I couldn't see Avengers, but also for missing my chance to watch football." He continued sharing on social media about how the power outage had disrupted his plans.

On March 15th at around midnight PT, a temporary fix managed by Los Angeles Department of Water and Power restored limited audio from "Avengers: Endgame" which allowed fans for another hour or so before completely cutting it off again as darkness fell over the Kodak Theatre complex with no further resolution.

The next day's media outlets are trying to delve deeper into what caused this unexpected disruption, while attendees continue voicing their anger and frustration towards management for ruining an evening of entertainment without proper explanation or compensation. 

With "Avengers: Endgame" now a rare experience shared by only those who managed the power outage fortunately not others as well but some are speculating about what to do next if similar situations arise in future screenings, with suggestions ranging from better emergency contingencies on part of event organizers or even moving high-profile events such as this one online when necessary.

In the meantice past few years while Los Angeles and other entertainment hubs across United States have been experiencing more power outages due to various factors including increasing demand, climate change impacting infrastructure, experts advise a proactive approach from organizers who plan events where live
