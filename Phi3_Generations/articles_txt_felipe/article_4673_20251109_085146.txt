In a surprising turn of events during this week's college football season opener at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas on Thursday evening, Notre Dame quarterback Ian Smith threw three interceptions within the first five minutes alone. The stunning performance came as one of the nation’s top recruits set his sights high upon winning a national title with Coach Brian Wallace'selite program next year but struggled to adapt at this critical stage, throwing for just 40 yards in the loss by Texas Tech University on Thursday night.

"I think we underestimated Ian's ability to face pressure," said one source close to Notre Dame who declined further comment citing privacy concerns about young players being involved with national media coverage of their performances, reports CNN. 

Notre Dame head coach Brian Wallace expressed his concern after the game stating that "it’s clear Ian needs additional support as he adjusts from high school football to college-level competition," per DailyMail.com exclusively reporting on its findings in Texas this weekend with permission granted by Notre Dame officials for access and commentary regarding their players' experiences, coaches interviews, and team analysis after the Cotton Bowl game concluded at 9pm ET Thursday night local time as expected to be viewed across all seven continents.

The start of Ian’s freshman year was met with great anticipation from fans, supporters alike eagerly following his progress on social media platforms since he joined the Fighting Irish last fall semester amidst high expectations surrounding him and Notre Dame's rich tradition in producing championship-winning quarterbacks. However, after three interceptions within five minutes of playing time against Texas Tech University that cost them dearly as they fell behind 14–0 before halftime with Ian throwing for just a measly four passes totaling only 56 yards on the night but causing headaches and concern among Coach Wallace'selite teammates.

Notre Dame senior running back Mike Ross, who has helped propel his fellow players up through successes this season already remarked during Friday morning interviews about Ian’s uncharacteristic struggles saying "Ian needs to work on understanding the offense better and managing time more effectively between plays," while Coach Wallace acknowledged that “it will take some adjusting for him but he's talented enough to do it.” 

One former Notre Dame quarterback who spoke with DailyMail.com after attending both games this season stated, "Ian has the talent and work ethic needed at this level which is evident from his play throughout high school - wherein we saw him become a two-time state champion as well." The current senior recruit was born in San Francisco but grew up across town with an older sister who also played quarterback for her high school before pursuing college football elsewhere. She joined Notre Dame's scholarship program last fall semester alongside other freshman classmates and has since been actively contributing to team meetings, practices as well as community events like the homecoming celebration on Oct 31 at Alumni Field with alums invited for tailgating festivities.

Coach Brian Wallace commented after Friday's win over Alabama State University that "we’ve identified Ian as one of our key playmakers, along with several other freshmen and upperclassmen," per DailyMail.com interviews published earlier this week in Texas alongside reporting from Notre
