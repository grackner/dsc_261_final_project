Topic: Travel - Lodging and Hotels

As winter sets in across New York City on Friday evening, a major snowstorm threatens to disrupt travel plans for thousands of holiday shoppers and tourists alike - with some hotels forced to cancel bookings as they grapple with staff shortages caused by the storm. The National Weather Service has issued a winter weather advisory warning that up to 12 inches (30 cm) of snow is expected in areas including Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens and Long Island starting at around 4 p.m., peaking during late-night hours before tapering off by the early morning hours on Saturday as temperatures dip below freezing throughout New York's five boroughs; this forecast has led to a flurry of cancellations from stranded travelers who are now facing an uncertain return trip.

Hoteliers and airport staff across NYC say the impending snowstorm, which follows three mild winter days prior, is already wreaking havoc on their normally bustling businesses; one operator tells Eyewitner that he had to cancel 50 rooms within hours as guests arrived after noticing an increase in cancellations. According to the National Weather Service's prediction modeling for New York City, snow accumulation is expected at rates of up to 2 inches per hour (around half a centimeter) during peak intensity and temperatures will remain around freezing point throughout the day; this has led hoteliers to take preventative measures by sending staff members home early ahead of schedule.

"We've gotten in touch with our employees at all locations across NYC, letting them know that due to an imminent snowstorm we are asking you guys to head back home as soon as possible," said Mike Donovan, a general manager for the Hilton Garden Inn on 34th Street & Seventh Avenue. "We have around seven rooms left today and these cancellations will happen very fast if more guests start arriving later tonight."

As airlines brace themselves to face massive flight delays in all major NYC hubs, travelers are being advised by the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey not only to check-in early but also carry necessary supplies such as food and blankets for their potentially lengthy stays. Official statements from both the MTA (Metropolitan Transportation Authority) have urged commuters against travelling in or out due to hazardous road conditions, while Mayor Eric Adams issued a travel advisory recommending people stay off of NYC streets during peak snowfall hours between 4 and 8 p.m. local time; the city's already shuttered restaurants will not reopen on Sunday as planned in order to accommodate for extra shift workers needed at transportation hubs, grocery stores and emergency medical centers - further complicating matters amidst a global pandemic that has restricted travel movements since early 2020.

"We are doing everything we can during these unpredictable times; every department across the city is working together to ensure everyone's safety," said Port Authority spokesperson Liza Rodriguez in an exclusive interview yesterday afternoon, adding that there will be free WiFi hotspots set up at various train stations and bus stops for those who need assistance navigating their way back home.

Sarah Thompson of Queens tells Eyewitner her hotel was fully booked even before the snow started falling but as she approached midnight last
