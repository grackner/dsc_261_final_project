"Australian authorities are investigating a severe hailstorm that struck Sydney on Friday night with unusual frequency and intensity," reports CNN International. The storm brought large stones as big as soccer balls to the bustling metropolis, causing power outages across multiple suburranies and disrupting traffic in central areas of New South Wales (NSW).

Residents were caught off guard by sudden darkness when lightning bolts flickered through a clear sky. Within minutes, thick white hail began pelting down upon the city at speeds up to 85 mph, prompting people to seek shelter immediately as they tried to protect themselves from potential injuries caused by falling debris and broken glass shattered on impact with surfaces below zero degrees Celsius.

"We have never seen anything like it here before," said Mayor of Parramatta Council Elizabeth Haines after assessing the damage in her jurisdiction along Sydney's outskirts where hailstones up to 8 inches wide were reportedly found lodged into fences and roof tiles, causing structural damages that might take weeks or even months for repairs.

Emergency services have been working around-the-clock since Friday evening when the storm hit with little warning; roads are now cleared while traffic is slowly resuming after rush hour has passed early today amidst continuous assessments of infrastructural damage incurred across various locations within Sydney's sprawling urban area.

A meteorologist from Bureau of Meteorology, Dr. Alex Turner spoke on Saturday morning about the record-breaking hailstorm: "What we witnessed last night was unprecedented - no other city has experienced such a heavy downpour and large ice pellets in history." According to official weather reports released shortly after sunrise today by NSW's Department of Environment, Science & Energy (DESE), temperatures across Sydney dropped drastically overnight due mainly to an intense low-pressure system that rolled into the region on Friday evening and produced significant hail as a consequence.

The storm has left at least 10 people with minor injuries who were seeking shelter during its peak intensity while several cars also sustained damages, requiring replacement parts or full replacements altogether depending upon individual assessments of cost-effective solutions provided by local garages and workshops specializing in automotive repair. Power remains out for thousands throughout the metropolitan area as utilities continue working tirelessly to restore service across affected regions amid frustrated residents who are now demanding answers about possible future occurrences similar in nature or severity that could further impact their livelihoods and quality of life here on Australia's east coast.

Official responses from Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison arrived shortly after mid-day local time today as he issued an apology over the unfortunate situation unfolding across Sydney during his scheduled trip to New Zealand for talks aimed at strengthening diplomatic ties with Kiwi authorities amid shared Pacific Island nation interests.

"I am deeply saddened by what I have seen in photos and videos of this hailstorm devastating parts of our city yesterday," said Morrison during an interview broadcast live on national news channels last night, calling for "extraordinary measures to help affected residents recover from damages sustained while simultaneously bolstering efforts aimed at mitigating risks associated with such severe weather events in future."

State Premier Gladys Berejiklian echoed similar sentiments during her morning press conference today
