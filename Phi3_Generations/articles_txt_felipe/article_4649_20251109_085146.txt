A major diplomatic row has flared up in recent days as tensions escalate between Israel and Palestine over West Bank settlement expansions, with sporadic violence erupting along the borders of East Jerusalem on Friday evening. The Israeli government announced plans to expand a controversial settlement complex near Al-Eizen al-Masjid mosque in Ramallah last month without prior consultation from Palestinian authorities, causing international condemnation and sparking protests across West Bank cities including Hebron and Nablus. According to Israel's ambassador to the United Nations Lonnie Grotheerich III, "Our rightful settlement expansion is a response not just in defense but also for our national security concerns." 

The international community has strongly criticized these actions as they are seen to undermine efforts towards peace and prosperity between Israelis and Palestinians. The UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres stated, "This latest action by the Israeli government only deepens mistrust on both sides of this protracted conflict." In response to the expansion plans' announcement last Thursday night, dozens of local demonstrators in East Jerusalem peacefully gathered outside Palestinian Authority headquarters demanding justice and an end to settlements. 

However, violence broke out during a confrontation between protesters and police at around midnight on Friday near Al-Eizen al-Masjid mosque resulting in two fatalities from both sides amid chaotic scenes of tear gas deployed by Israeli forces against Palestinian civilians. The conflict quickly drew the attention of world leaders, who voiced their deep concern over Israel's settlement policies and its impact on regional stability during an emergency session at United Nations headquarters this weekend in New York City. 

Palestinian officials have called for international intervention to halt further expansion activities while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu emphasized the security needs of his country amidst growing threats from neighboring countries and extremist factions within Palestine itself. UN Special Envoy Tor Wennell stated, "The situation on this ground calls us all - nations involved in peace talks as well as observers - to redouble our efforts towards a lasting solution." In the wake of these developments, world powers including France and Germany have urged both parties for renewed dialogue aimed at resolving issues surrounding Jerusalem's status while respecting international law. 

The Palestinian Authority has called on Israel to immediately halt settlement construction within occupied territories pending a return to direct negotiations between Israeli officials and the newly elected government of Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah, headquartered less than two miles away from Al-Eizen al-Masjid mosque. Netanyahu responds that any resumption or expansion plans would not be done unilaterally but with continued commitment to dialogue toward a peaceful solution and acknowledgment of Israel's right as an established Jewish state for security reasons amidst continuing threats from radical elements within Palestine itself, including Hamas militants. As tensions continue along the divided city lines near Jerusalem’s Old City walls between Israeli soldiers enforcing curfew orders against local protestors demanding freedom and civil rights alongside Muslim pilgrims visiting sacred sites in Al-Eizen al-Masjid mosque, world leaders urge both sides to pursue peaceful means of resolution.
