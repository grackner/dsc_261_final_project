In a daring heist that stunned Las Vegas yesterday evening, thieves made off with an estimated $10 million from Fortune World Casino within minutes of the crime's discovery at around 8 PM local time. Security cameras captured two suspicious figures in masks and clothing disguising their identities as they pulled a classic black bag casino robbery, leaving no trace but panic amongst staff members when alarms blared through the facility on South Strip Boulevard near Paradise Road at approximately 8:15 PM.

"It was surreal," said an eyewitty witness who identified himself only as John Smith to CNN affiliate KLAS, speaking about his harrowing experience during a patrol break outside the casino when he heard screams of panic emanating from inside Fortune World Casino. "I saw people running for their lives with guns drawn and thought I was witnessing some kind of horror film reel."

This is not Smith's first encounter with crime in Las Vegas—he previously provided crucial information leading to the arrest of a serial pickpocket five years ago, according to Clark County Sheriff's Office records. Despite his past experience and clear knowledge about casinos’ security measures due to numerous patrol rounds he has done overtime as part of their reserve officers unit; Smith was taken aback by how swiftly the robbery unfolded before him on a Friday night when most guests had left for an evening out in town.

Las Vegas is no stranger to crime, with high-profile cases such as kidnappings and even murders happening frequently at places like Fortune World Casino; however, casino robberies remain quite rare because of the extensive security measures put into place by these establishments—multiple surveillance cameras are installed in all areas where valuables may be kept.

According to Detective Sarah Miller from Clark County Sheriff's Office: "The sheer speed at which this happened was alarming; even for us, used to dealing with high-stress situations here daily—it left a mark." Fortune World Casino’s security chief Tom Garcia confirmed that the heist broke all records on his watch in terms of time taken from robbery identification until casino staff members were evacuated. "We have always prided ourselves as being one step ahead, but this was outright brazen," said Chief Garcia who added with a sigh: “The entire event shakes us to the core."

Investigators are trying their best not to tip off any potential suspects; no arrests were made by late last night. However, surveillance footage captured just before and after the heist shows at least three individuals in suspicious clothing lurking around various entrances near 7:45 PM – an hour earlier than what one witness reported seeing them when they allegedly entered Fortune World Casino through a side door with two gunmen armed.

Chief Garcia believes the motive behind this heist could be related to recent reports of criminal activity within organized crime circles here in Las Vegas, which has seen an increase over just one year ago – data from Clark County Sheriff’s Office shows that burglary and robbery incidents have spiked by almost 20% compared to the same period last year. "I wouldn't be surprised if this was a targeted crime linked directly or indirectly with organized criminal synd
