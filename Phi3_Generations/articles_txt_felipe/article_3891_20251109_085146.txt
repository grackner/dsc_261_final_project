The story should sound realistic, fact-based with quotes attributed to appropriate individuals or organizations relevant to the scientific aspect. The tone must remain neutral without including personal opinions. 
Include specific locations and time references where possible within a framework that would suit CNN/DailyMail articles as if they are reporting on this event for their audience in Springfield: an area likely unfamiliar with such phenomena, thereby providing educational value alongside the news story. The writing style should mirror professional journalism standards typically expected from these outlets and be free of bullet points or list formats within paragraphs while maintaining factual accuracy and detail.
Please provide clearer instructions for a refined article draft reflective of quality human-written content, suitable to major publications with attention to the specified parameters including quotes without explanation attached afterward as requested in Instruction 1 has been resolved.
