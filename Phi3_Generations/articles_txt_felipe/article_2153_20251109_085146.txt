A recent outbreak of bed bug infestations has hit luxury hotels across Los Angeles County with surprising frequency over the past year, drawing attention to pest control and lodging standards in one of America's most popular travel destinations for business people and tourists alike. According to data from county health inspections conducted since January 2021, there have been a reported increase of bed bug cases at numerous five-star establishments within the area—a trend that hoteliers are struggling to contain as they work with extermination companies specializing in pest removal.


In an effort to regain customer trust and meet safety expectations, many hotels have revamped their cleaning protocols or reconsidered guest policies when it comes to bookings following previous infestations at competitors. "It's critical for us as hoteliers that we maintain the highest levels of hygiene," says Marissa Alvarez, General Manager of The Regal Los Angeles Resort & Spa (TRLARS).


Recent inspection reports have found bed bug infestations at four different five-star hotels: Ritz Carlton Beverly Hills on July 20th; Waldorf Astoria Monaco, Pasadena on August 5th; Hotel Zenith, Venice Beach during the September tourist season; and The Four Seasons Los Angeles in November just weeks before Thanksg0-day travel. "We've seen an increase of around 30% over last year at this time," says Dr. Emily Sanchez from County Health Services regarding bed bug detections across hotels, while acknowledging that the rise could be a result of more frequent inspections or simply increased reporting by guests and staff who are now better educated on how to identify these pests.


"No business wants their customers walking out with bad experiences due to something entirely preventable," states local exterminator Joe Thompson, whose company has been called in multiple times this year for bed bug treatments at luxury hotels throughout Los Angeles County. 

Hoteliers and health officials are working on increased education campaigns around pest control as they navigate the unfortunate reality that even with stringent cleaning practices some establishments can still fall victim to infestations, especially during high tourist seasons when occupancy rates soar beyond usual capacities. 

Affected hotels have been urged by city officials and experts alike for visitors to verify if their accommodations were bed bug-free before arrival; while others are investing in new pest control systems or reassessing partnerships with extermination companies, aiming at preventative measures rather than just reactionary responses.

"We're confident that our proactive strategies will not only protect guests but also elevate the trust and quality associated with staying here," asserts Alvarez from TRLARS regarding their comprehensive new pest-control initiatives which include enhanced staff training, frequent professional inspections by certified exterminators, high-tech monitoring systems in bedding areas, and immediate action upon any report of infestation.

The local lodging industry is hopeful that these measures will mitigate the impact on their reputation while ensuring a comfortable stay for all guests without giving room bugs uninvited stays themselves—a sentiment echoed by other hoteliers in the region expressing support and solidar0-ity to maintain high standards of cleanliness.
