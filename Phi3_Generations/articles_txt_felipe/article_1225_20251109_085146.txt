In an unprecedented decision that shocked fans and experts alike across Tampa Bay on Sunday afternoon during Week 12 of NFL play, coach Mike Tomlin announced the suspension of star quarterback Patrick Mahomes following his inadvertent physical altercation with a reporter from ESPN at last night's postgame celebration.

"I wanted to clarify that this incident was out-of-character for any player," said Commissioner Roger Goodell after meeting separately earlier today, adding the league takes such issues very seriously and will conduct its investigation before making further decisions."This has brought up concerns about safety in the locker room which we as a league are committed to addressing,” he continued.

The incident occurred when ESPN's Jay Glazer was asked for an interview at Sunday’s practice, during which NFL players had gathered after their team victory over Atlanta Falcons on Thanksgiving Day. Tensions seemed high among the Browns squad as they celebrated before taking flight back to Cleveland following Monday night's departure from Sun Life Stadium in Miami Gardens Florida; and a heated argument ensued between Glazer, Tomlinson who is also an ESPN contributor, along with several other players present.

During that exchange of words reportedly about national anthems being sung by NFL teams after winning on Thanksgiving Day—a long-standing tradition in the league and one which has been criticized as unnecessary bloat to game time excitement--an altercation led Mahomes, who had just thrown for 329 yards throughout his playoff run this year alone according to Pro Football Reference data; rushing out of earshot. He then engaged with Glazer directly in what witness said was a physical tussle that ended when the Browns head coach stepped in and separated them," an insider who saw everything unfold told ESPN.

In response, Tomlin's statement read: "We need to respect each other on-and-off the field as professional athletes representing not just ourselves but our city." 

Tommy Reese, Glazer’s teammate at ESPN and a Browns player; said that he had seen Mahomes shaken up by their exchange. “Patrick has always been such an elite competitor-he'd never put anyone through for something like this.” He suggested to reporters his fear of the fallout from today’s events, including whether Tomlin would stick with him as a teammate and what impact it may have on Mahomes. 

The NFL is expected to make their decision by Wednesday following an investigation into Friday's altercation; while Glazer has since apologized for his part in the exchange claiming he got emotional because of how hardworking these athletes are who dedicate so much time and energy towards football, as well some other unrelated topics such as gun control.

"I believe Patrick Mahomes is a great player," said Glazer after being questioned on Sunday about his views regarding suspension or any further punishment for him; he added that it was never appropriate to address personal matters outside of work and urged everyone involved take some time off the field, as well.

The incident has led sports commentators across various media outlets including ESPN's Dan Graziano who opined on Twitter: "It’s hard not see this behavior by MMAHoMes players...but I can understand how he must feel to be accused in public and have things said that just aren’t fair or
