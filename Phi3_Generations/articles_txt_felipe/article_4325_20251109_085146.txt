A powerful storm system has swept through Central America on Thursday morning, causing widespinning floods and landslides in Nicaragua with at least three fatalities reported as of now. The National Meteorological Institute (IMN) says that rainfall reached up to four inches per hour overnight, leading to unprecedented water levels on rivers across the region especially around Managua, Honduras' capital city and a hub for commerce in Nicaragua.

The storm arrived unexpectedly during what had been forecasted as dry weather by meteorologists from Central American nations’ respective National Meteorological Services (NMS), with no signs of tropical activity predicted beyond the end-of-week. According to Dr. Maria Gomez, a senior researcher at NMS and renowned climatologist in Nicaragua, "It was an anomaly that left us scrambling for response plans."

"We had not expected such heavy rains," said Daniel Rodriguez of the Honduras Red Cross as emergency personnel arrived to assist local residents. He recounted how several nearby villages were evacuated and now face a grim future if relief efforts don’t improve quickly. "Every minute counts, we are dealing with so much devastation," he said in distress.

Rescue operations have been hampered by damaged infrastructure including bridges washed out from the deluge-trigger landslides and flooded roads that cut off many remote communities within a 20-mile radius of Managua, making it nearly impossible to reach some affected areas for days at a time.

The Central American Network (CAN) reports there are more than three thousand people in shelters or with nowhere safe left due to the flooding and damages from landslides that swept away homes and farmlands across Nicaragua's major urban hub, Managua – a city of nearly two million residents.

The UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reports thousands more homeless in surrounding departments such as León where rainfall reached up to three inches per hour overnight on Wednesday night with similar conditions developing across parts of Honduras and Guatemala including the Maya Mountains.

With a forecasted storm coming later this week, authorities are calling for urgent international aid funding while also ramping-up search efforts in Nicaragua amidst an increasing number of landslides trapping people inside homes that remain standing but seemingly abandoned as debris piles up around them. The Government of Honduras has declared a state of emergency with the nation's military deploy to affected areas alongside health officials, volunteer rescue teams and humanitarian aid providers from several countries including Canada who arrived by helicopter yesterday evening for ground operations once weather permits next weekend.

"We need urgent assistance," said President Alvaro Medina of Honduras in a press conference today as he toured one of the hardest-hit districts, Cordelia with flood waters that have not receded since last night despite efforts by local authorities to drain them off through natural and manmade channels. "This will require significant international aid funding for infrastructure repairs before we can even begin a comprehensive recovery."

The UN Development Program (UNDP) has set up an emergency response team while calling on governments worldwide alongside private donors to contribute financially by Friday, December 21st. "We need
