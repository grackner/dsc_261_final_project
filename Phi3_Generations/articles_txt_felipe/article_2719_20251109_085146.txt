Researchers in California have made a groundbredependent discovery that may hold promise for reversing early signs of aging and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's. A team from the Buck Institute on Aging, based near San Francisco Bay Area, identified an enzyme called BMK1 which could be key to developing a new generation of drugs aimed at promoting cellular rejuvenation and brain health in older adults living with early signs of cognitive decline.

Dr. Elizabeth Blackburn from the Buck Institute on Aging, who led this study alongside senior researcher Dr. David Lindquist announced their findings today during a press conference held at Stanford University Medical Center where they will present further details about BMK1 and its implications for future drug development in aging-related diseases like Alzheimer's disease later next month, December 3rd of this year.

"It has long been established that as we age our cells begin to experience stress which leads not only to deteriorating physical strength but also cognitive decline," Dr. Blackburn said at the press conference alongside Stanford President Prof. John Hennessey-Silvent, M.D., Ph.D. "But what if there was an enzyme that could help our cells fight this natural aging process? This is where BMK1 comes into play."

The scientists found a connection between increased levels of the protein p27 and reduced activity in neurons among older adults with mild cognitive impairment during their research. Further study indicated that boosted expression of enzyme-modifying proteins like BMK1 could reverse these negative effects on brain function, providing hope for millions suffering from age-related decline worldwide today and beyond into the future as well."

Dr. David Lindquist elaborated further at a later stage in their press conference saying: "Our findings suggest that by enhancing BMK1 activity through medication or lifestyle changes such as exercise, nutrition-rich diet etc., individuals may be able to delay age-related cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's Disease."

A recent study by the Buck Institute on Aging estimates that around 20% of people aged over 65 experience some degree of mild cognitive impairment leading to progressively worse memory loss, slower thinking speed and difficulty with tasks requiring planning or organizing. The global prevalence is estimated at nearly one in ten individuals older than the age of 40 having signs consistent with early onset Alzheimer's Disease alone today as well based upon statistics reported by worldwide health organizations like World Health Organization (WHO).

However, Dr. Elizabeth Blackburn believes this discovery brings a beacon of hope for millions around the globe suffering from age-related cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's Disease: "Our findings could change how we perceive aging as it relates to our brains, opening new doors in terms not just treatment but prevention too."

CNN Health experts comment on the study with cautious optimism. Dr. Robert Adams from Stanford University School of Medicine told CNN: "This is an important step forward and we must investigate further into these mechanisms before moving toward human trials, which could be 5-7 years away."
