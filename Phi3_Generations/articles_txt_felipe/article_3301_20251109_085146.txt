In an unprecedented move in television history, CBS has announced tonight'seldest original series finale—an hour-long special entitled "Farewell to Friends." Airing on September 12th at 8 PM ET from the iconic Studio B of CBS Television City located in Hollywood, this unique format brings together a select group of beloved characters for their swan song.

Longtime fans and industry insiders alike are buzzing about tonight's unforgettable event that promises to conclude an era spanning 15 remarkable seasons since its debut on September 24, 2007. As the anticipation builds up towards "Farewell to Friends," we had a chance to speak with some of those who have been instrumental in bringing this iconic series into existence and shaping it over years.

When asked about their feelings regarding tonight's special, executive producer Marion Dougherty said: “This has been the most extraordinary journey for us all - as directors, writers, performers, we have spent decades creating unforgettable moments on screen that continue to resonate with audiences today. We are eternally grateful and humbled by their loyalty.”

The unique format combines monologues delivered directly from the heart of each character about pivotal episodes in which they played, intimate one-on-one discussions between characters on past experiences that defined them as people beyond being merely actors/actresses, a series finale episode set at significant real locations throughout New York City—their home for most seasons.

Director and showrunner Laura Smith expressed the intention to encapsulate not just an hour of television but decades-worth experience in this special. “It’s been my privilege over fifteen years on 'Farewell to Friends' being part of such a diverse, talented ensemble cast whose chemistry is undeniable," said Laura Smith. "With each episode we created memories together that only strengthened with time. Tonight, our aim was not merely ending the series but celebrating all those moments while looking forward."

Critics and audiences worldwide eagerly await tonight's special as a touching tribute to this enduring legacy in American television history—and many are already sharing memories of favorite episodes with loved ones or posting on social media about how they remember the characters from 'Farewell to Friends.'

In true tradition, cast members will be reunited at CBS Television City following tonight's special for photos and an exclusive discussion regarding their journey together as well. Fans can also catch a glimpse of what’s next during reruns scheduled later in the week on CTV Canada (US viewers tuning into Reelz, AMC or encore-network will need to watch archives online).

As Marion Dougherty aptly put it—“When we created this series together five years ago as a group of young actors fresh out of school who had no idea where life would take us next but wanted to make something great, I never imagined in my wildest dreams that one day here could be.”

It's an evening not just about closure for "Farewell to Friends" fans but also a momentous occasion celebrating the enduring spirit of storytelling.
