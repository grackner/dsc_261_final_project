"New Orleans Saints' All-Pro wide receiver Drew Brees announces retirement with immediate effect." New Orleans will be home to a somber event this Sunday when former NFL star and three-time MVP, the renowned quarterback of Louisiana Superdome, officially hangs up his cleats. Brees made the decision following what he described as 'a tough season' plagued by injuries that affected not only himself but also key teammates on both sides of the ball.

"Everyone knows I love playing football and giving back to my community, so when it came time for me to make a choice between health concerns or continuing with this incredible journey at 42 years old was quite difficult," Brees admitted during his announcement yesterday. The New Orleans Saints signal-caller has been one of the most successful players in team history and is loved by many loyal fans who followed him for over two decades, from when he became an undrafted rookie with San Diego to leading Chicago's victory against Indianapolis 24 years later.

The news came as a surprise on Friday afternoon after Brees appeared ready to continue his career at Saints Meadowlands Arena during the first preseason game of training camp, where he threw touchdown passes and dashed downfield for easy gains himself before pulling back into offense-changing plays with incredible precision. He said goodbye as if this was something more than just a test run on his way to greeting family members at halftime during the Saints' next home game, an occasion that will be tinged by sorrow and bittersweet memories of triumphs won together both in-game play and offseason charity work.

"No one wants to see their teammates hurt on this level," said former NFL coach Mike Tomlin today as he reflected back on Brees' time with Pittsburgh Steelers, where they clinched Super Bowl victories under his leadership while playing together in 2013 and again four years later. "But I understand that at the end of the day you have to make tough calls for yourself when it comes down to personal health."

Former Saints star receiver Terrell Owens offered an emotional response from Houston, where he was attending Sunday Night Football as a guest analyst: 'I've been in this league long enough and played hard myself back home with Dallas Cowboys.' He couldn’t help but draw parallels between the two talented quarterbacks of yore who had called Louisiana their second homes.

"We need to honor our champions like Brees by continuing his legacy off the field in helping us grow together as a city," said New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell during today's City Council meeting, where local officials expressed gratitude for all that he accomplished while representing them on national television screens. 

CNN NFL Insider and former quarterback Jim Nantz shared his own reflections yesterday evening: "When I think about Drew Brees as a player – how dominant was he? And then you see him now in the Saints' ownership group, trying to do what it takes for New Orleans kids by running business deals that give them internships and jobs. It just speaks volumes of character."

As word spread across social media platforms throughout Friday night about Brees calling his career with the San Diego Chargers in 2003 when he signed as an undrafted rookie one final time before moving on to
