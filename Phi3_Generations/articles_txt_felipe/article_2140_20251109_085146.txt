In a daring rescue operation carried out overnight on March 15th in the heart of Nairobi, Kenya's capital city, authorities successfully rescued six school children who had become trapped under debris following an unforeseen landslide triggered by recent heavy rains. The incident occurred just outside Muguruni Primary School at around 3:00 AM local time when the ground gave way as a result of continuous downpours that have led to flash floods across multiple regions in Kenya this season, reports CNN Africa Bureau Chief John Doe.

"It was one hellish night for these children," said Reverend Peter Ndungu from Muguruni Community Church where the families often gather after school activities and before attending church services together. "We could hear screams echoing down below, their cries were desperate as they clawed away at the rubble that threatened to swallow them whole."

The children had been playing in a nearby field when disaster struck; within minutes of feeling the ground shaking and hearing thunderous roars overhead. The local community quickly rallied around, with many running towards Muguruni Primary School where teachers acted swiftly as first responders, guiding people to safety while waiting for reinforcries from emergency services which took time due to weather-related disruptions in transportation networks throughout the city and beyond.

"I remember looking out my window just before midnight feeling like something was terribly wrong," shared Mrs. Muthoni Agena, mother of one rescued child named Peter Njuguna who sat beside her as she waited anxiously outside with other parents in their neighborhoods until the rescue operation concluded around 8:30 AM local time on March 16th when all children and staff were found unharmed. "Seeing them emerge from that darkness, battered but alive—it was nothing short of a miracle."

As Kenya battles increasing occurrences of natural disasters linked to climate change including drought-induced famines in the arid regions near Lake Turkana and escalating conflict over dwindling resources which displaced thousands since 2016, this latest tragedy underscores how vulnerable communities across East Africa continue to face unprecedented threats from Mother Nature.

A representative of Kenya Red Cross Society who flew into Nairobi yesterday morning for an emergency meeting with officials said: "We've been working tirelessly in flood-affected areas trying desperately recoup lost homes and rehabilitate those whose lives have changed forever, but now we must focus our efforts on ensuring no child faces these dangers ever again."

Kenyan government spokesperson Charles Omondi told reporters that emergency infrastructure improvements are being planned along vulnerable riversides prone to flash flooding with input from engineers already drafting the new designs, though he noted challenges in securing additional funding amidst other pressing national needs.

"We will also be examining how we can better integrate traditional disaster response systems used by local communities into our own strategies moving forward," Omondi added while promising to continue working closely with affected families and support groups during this difficult time, as well as in partnership with NGOs like the Red Cross who remain an essential part of providing relief services across Kenya.
