A last-minute endorsement could sway a closely contested Senate race in Pennsylvania this November as former Vice President Joe Biden threw his support behind Democratic challenger Pat Sullivan against Republican Rick Huncke, Politico reports. The development comes amid claims from the Trump campaign that Democrats are "trying to steal" an election and ahead of Tuesday's primary vote in a state with 20 electoral votes at stake on November 3rd alongside local elections across the country.

Pennsylvania is known as a battleground state where both parties have won presidential elections, but it has leaned Republican over recent decades when awarding senators — although there are several races this year in which control of either chamber could shift red or blue depending on voter preferences. In the Senate race'in Philadelphia County,' Sullivan appears to be holding his own against Huncke after he secured 35% support from registered Democrats and Independents through an informal poll conducted by Voter-Vitals, a political data firm that works with news organizations nationwide.

"Joe Biden's endorsement could tip the scales in this closely contested race," said Democratic strategist Mark Pack at Political Futures Research Group as he explained why national figures matter so much to local elections like these,' reports Politico, citing a source knowledgeable about Huncke and Sullivan.

In his formal announcement for Pennsylvania on Friday evening, Biden stressed that voters must decide their next senator based solethemselves without any interference from President Trump or other political figures, saying: "We all know how hard the last four years have been — but we still got to get through this election together. We’ve already had more than a few disputes over whether democracy itself should even exist.”

“But right now I want you guys just to focus on getting your vote out, because there are going to be people trying everything they can do that might keep some of us from voting." He continued: “I urge all Americans — Democrats and Republicans alike —to get up in November. Please take this time off work or anything else you’ve got coming at the same minute.”

The development arrives as President Trump has repeatedly made false claims about voter fraud throughout his campaign, allegations that have no evidence to back them,' notes Politico referencing an ABC News poll last week finding 40% of Americans don't trust election officials. "Trump is going after Biden for taking a shot at him on the Senate race," said Jennifer Rubin, senior White House correspondent and Fox Nation host as she discussed why national figures matter so much to local elections like these.'

Meanwhile in New York state where Democrats are running several candidates up against Republicans this November including five congressional races. The party faces tough challenges ahead after suffering a string of losses over the last decade or so,' CNN reports, citing research from FiveThirtyEight Political Analyst Nate Cohn and University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato as they predict two to three seats could flip this November based on pre-election polls.

"New York's history tells us that when Republicans are in power, Democrat candidates often perform well," said former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg at an event held last night by the Alliance for Responsible Voting with other donors to help promote their mission and fundraising efforts going forward into T
