Bali's once-popular night markets are set to close temporarily due to recent safety concerns and growing competition from new entertainment options in Bali city, as local authorities announced this morning (June 15). The decision follows the surge of tourists visiting Balinese cultural sites after an uptick in global travel.

Bali Tourism Authority official I Wayan Swastika says: "We are temporarily closing down these markets because they no longer align with our vision for a safe and sustainable experience." The night markets, which have been popular among tourists seeking an immersive Balinese culture experience since 2018, will remain shut from July to November this year.

The news comes after several incidents of pickpocketing, petty thefts, and fights broke out last month in these night market areas during peak hours when tourists thronged for authentic Balinese street food experiences. In one such incident on May 10th at a popular Tikus Beach Night Market stall selling handcrafted souvenirs, five individuals were caught stealing items worth $5,00in total by security guards before escaping in the night without being identified.

A local entrepreneur and market vendor named Made I Wayan shared his thoughts on how new entertainment options have impacted foot traffic at these markets: "I've seen a significant drop-off over the past year as more tourists are opting for modern shopping experiences, live music venues or even nightclub outings instead of visiting our traditional street food stalls."

Additionally, Balinese officials have voiced concerns about environmental sustainability. Deputy Mayor I Ketut Suki said: "The excessive plastic waste generated by these markets and the tourist-driven consumption culture is becoming alarming for us as we aim to maintain our natural heritage."

CNN, contacted at their office in Denpasar yesterday (June 16), confirmed that Balinese officials have been closely monitoring safety issues within night market areas since last year. Officials say the temporary closure provides a vital timeframe not only for assessing risks but also to enhance security measures before welcoming back visitors post-pandemic era restrictions relaxation in December this year.

The city council plans on collaborating with local community leaders and business owners, as well as tourism experts from neighboring Indonesian islands like Java or Sulawesi where similar closures have proven beneficial during past years of economic slowdowns due to global travel disruharmonies. 

Reactions among Balinese locals towards the news are mixed; some understand and support this decision for a better, more sustainable tourism industry while others fear losing income from market stalls that heavily rely on night-time foot traffic. However, many see it as an opportunity to pivot their business models or explore other alternatives like online sales channels amidst changing trends in the global travel scene towards responsible and immersive experiences beyond conventional sightseeing spots within a destination country's borders.

The Balinese Tourism Authority will hold several workshops on safety protocols, market security enhancement strategies including CCTV cameras installation across all stalls as well as providing financial aid for small-scale vendors to make necessary adaptations until the markets can reopen in November this year. 

This decision has caused ripple effects beyond Balinese borders; neighboring islands like B
