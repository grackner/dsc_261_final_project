At an exclusive art gallery opening last night in New York City, a surprising discovery unfolded when one of Vincent van Gogh's masterpieces thought to be lost for over a century was unveiled as authentic and had been secretly on display at the gallery all along. The revelation took place amidst high-profile guests who were unaware that 'Café Terrace at Night,' which hung in plain sight, wasn't actually there until last night when curator Alice Martin made a startling announcement during the event held at Chelsea Modern on November 15th.

Curator Alice Martin explained how she stumbled upon Van Gogh's lost work while conducting an inventory check of her gallery’s private collection, finding it mislabeled and forgotten in storage. "When I first saw the palette—the vibrant colors that evoke such emotion as they do on this canvas—I knew something extraordinary was hidden right under our noses," Martin shared with a mix of disbelief and excitement at her discovery's magnitude, revealing its true identity to those gathered.

The painting’s authenticity has been confirmed by leading art historians who examined the piece in detail last week after initial suspicions were raised when inconsistencies between dated documents claimed ownership within a private collection went unnoticed for decades. "It's as close to what Van Gogh intended, and I’ve studied his work extensively," stated Professor James O'Donnell from the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. “This is an extraordinary find.”

The painting had last been publicly displayed over 100 years ago at a small gallery in Brussels before mysteriously disappearing after van Gogh’s death. Van Meer, who originally acquired it as part of his personal collection from the Belgian art dealer's widow in the late '20s and then bequeathed to her children upon their father's passing a century ago, had left vague notes that sparked interest but never led investigators closer until now.

Gallery attendees watched as curator Martin unveiled what would surely become one of history’s most talked-about finds in the art world; guests erupted into whispers and gasps among themselves once they heard Van Gogh's name being called out, with many expressing disbelief. "I can hardly grasp it," said attendee David Harrington after catching sight of 'Café Terrace at Night.'

The artwork has been added to the New York City Museum’s collection and will be on display for all visitors starting next month, with an exhibition dedicated solely to Van Gogh's overlooked works. Experts believe that this discovery could shed new light on van Gogh as a masterful impressionist who experimented beyond what was previously known of his artistic techniques.

Art historian Dr. Helen Richardson suggests the painting’s long concealment and secrecy may point to its significance in understanding Van Gogh's development: "Van Gogh had this incredible evolution that seemed almost secretive, but he also wanted recognition for it." With a promising outlook towards further discoveries within hidden gems of van Gogh’s oeuvre lying dormant worldwide.

The New York art community is buzzing with excitement following the Van Meer Gallery unveiling what might be one of history's most significant and en
