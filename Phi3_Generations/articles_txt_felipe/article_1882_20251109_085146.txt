A sudden drop in temperatures has led to a remarkable tourist surge as visitors flock to Alaska's Tracy Marine Park for an early winter adventure this month. The National Weather Service reported that the annual average high temperature at Seward, where the park is located approximately 120 miles southwest of Anchorage along Cook Inlet and open ocean coastline on the Gulf of Alaska's southern shore near the Kenai Peninsula Borough has plummeted to an early seasonal low.

As a result, local authorities have seen double or more visits than during traditional winter months like December through February when temperatures average around 34 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius). On some days in late November alone, the temperature dipped below freezing with highs rarely seeing above 50°F.

The park offers activities such as whale watching and kayaking; officials say these are among top reasons for visitors' sudden interest amidst mild Alaskan weather conditions before winter sets in full force later this month or early December when temperatures average around the same highs of 34°F. In recent years, Seward has seen an influx each November due to its proximity from major cities like Anchorage and Seattle which make it a perfect stop for last-minute winter getaways before Christmas travelers depart back home or move on southward after the holids season concludes around New Year's Day.

"This year is different, though," says Seward Chamber of Commerce President Tom Davis who adds that his business experienced a nearly 60% increase in call volumes seeking reservations compared to last November with little drop-off since October when temperatures were mildly cooler yet not extreme enough for many tourists considering Alaskan winter adventures.

"Visitors are coming from all over the Lower 48 and Canada looking specifically at our park which normally gets more traffic in March," says Davis who expects next season's influx to continue as local news reports shared stories of families taking advantage of discounted cruise packages offered by operators like Delta Airlines that include stops at several destinations along Cook Inlet coastline.

Tracy Marine Park Superintendent Jim Bennett said the unseasonable warmth and mild temperatures have made it difficult to maintain regular tourism schedules but acknowledges some benefits too: "While we've had challenges with staffing levels due in part because people prefer not travel during these hotter periods of our traditional winter season, visitors are happy that they can enjoy whale watching and kayaking despite the odd weather."

Bennett adds park officials have been working diligently to accommodate an unprecedented number of guests while ensuring visitor safety on icy waters. "We've had some near-miss incidents this year with tourists venturing out onto frozen inlets without proper experience or gear which is concerning, but so far everyone involved has been lucky enough to walk away unhurt."

Experts at the University of Alaska Fairbanks say that climate change likely contributed significantly as well. "The overall warming trend across much of North America's West Coast region continues due primarily because oceanic waters warm earlier in springtime with subsequent effects felt throughout fall into winter," says climatologist Dr. Sarah Jones who adds further research is being done on this year's anomalous pattern and its potential impact to local ecology along Cook Inlet
