In a shocking turn of events this weekend in New York City, tourists were stranded at JFK Airport due to an unexpected blizzard that blanketed the city with heavy snow on Friday afternoon and evening (March 5-6). As predicted by meteorologists earlier last month as merely a possibility during their forecast for mild winter conditions in January, Mother Nature had other plans. With temperatures hovering around freezing point at minus two degrees Celsius to one degree above zero Fahrenheit and humidity levels dipping below 30%, New Yorkers were braced as the snowflakes began their descent earlier than usual on February's end, leading up to a sudden drop in atmospherin temperature from plus ten to minus fifteen degrees Celsius overnight.

Visitors and locals alike found themselves caught off guard when nearly 30cm of freshly fallen snow accumulated at the airport by early Saturday morning; as reported on CNN, this unforeseen weather anomaly caused flight delays or cancellations for up to 14 hours in a row. Amid these disruptions and frigid conditions inside JFK's Terminal A were more than two hundred international travelers from various nations including Canada, Germany, China, India, South Africa, Australia—and the USA itself which was under no different snowfall circumstances given its geographical location outside of typical blizzard zones.

A representative for TSA told CNN that they had already implemented extra screening measures at security checkpoints and are working closely with airlines to resume normal operations as soon as possible while keeping everyone safe on site: "We understand the inconvenience this has caused our travelers, but we want them to feel assured about their safety in dealing with these exceptional weather events."

Flight delays have since extended through Sunday and into Monday morning causing a ripple effect throughout other major airports across Northeastern cities including Philadelphia International Airport (PHL) located around 60 miles west of JFK; Boston Logan National Airport felt the impact even further north near coastal Massachusetts as well. American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines have all issued statements apologizing to their customers for extended delays or cancellations spanning thousands over multiple continents while urging patience during these trying times: "We are doing everything in our power to get everyone back on track quickly but weather conditions may persist beyond today."

As temperatures continue dropping throughout Sunday night before rising slightly into early Monday morning, travelers have been advised not only of potential delays and cancellations at other airports across the region including Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) located approximately 30 miles away in neighboring state-of92/NJ; LaGuardia International Airport further uptown is yet another hub grappling with similar complications due to winter weather: "This situation has been incredibly challenging for all involved parties, but we will work together diligently moving forward."

Experts stress that the frequency and severity of these unpredictable events appears more common as climate change continues its steady march across our planet - not only causing significant disruptions within air travel industry worldwide. An MIT Climate Scientist commented to CNN: "These extreme weather occurrences are becoming increasingly frequent due primarily to rising global temperatures caused by human activities; this is likely indicative of future patterns we can expect if greenhouse gases emissions aren't reduced
