In an unprecedented turn of events in television history, a beloved sitcom based on New York City'deep-dish pizza scene is set to move its entire production from the Big Apple back eastward. The decision comes as CBS has announced it will bring "New York Minute" to Los Angeles beginning with Season 3 after two successful years in Manhattan since September of last year, reported CNN Hollywood Reporter on Tuesday.


After discussions between CBS executives and the show's producers led by creator-director Michael Catlin (The Ellen Show), a shift to Los Angeles has been agreed upon for both logistical ease and potential growth in viewership – as indicated by an internal poll of current fans, 60% showed more interest watching episodes filmed away from the city.


"We're excited about this next chapter," said Catlin during a press conference at CBS studios yesterday afternoon (March 27). "The magic has been here for years and our success shows that we can take it to new places." He added, "New York is not going anywhere but the show will always cherish its roots in New York City. We're looking forward to this exciting opportunity with L.A., home of Hollywood."


The transition has been met with mixed feelings among fans – some eager for change while others express nostalgia over losing iconic Manhattan landmarks and scenes that made the show a classic staple in TV lore, according to DailyMail articles from last weekend's fan meet-up event. Fans expressed: "I loved how New York was part of 'New York Minute.' The city is our heartbeat," said longtime viewer and East Village resident Sarah Klein during the gathering at Madison Square Park, moments before CBS announced their decision to relocate production.


However, others see potential growth for "New York Minute" in Los Angeles' expansive film industry which offers diverse creative opportunities – including expanding into new genres beyond comedy as part of the network’s commitment towards diversity and innovation: Executive Vice President Bob Smith told reporters at a press conference on Tuesday, "The move to L.A. is an investment in our series' growth and longe0vity."


Next steps for CBS involve scouting suitable film locations within Los Angeles starting this fall season as the show prepares to shoot its third year beginning 2025 with a full cast, crew -and fans eagerly await their return. In conclusion, "New York Minute" stands at an exciting crossroads – leaving behind beloved New York scenes for promising horizons in Los Angeles as CBS moves ahead confident that this will only fuel the show's enduring success and cult-following appeal across America."
