A historic moment unfolded in Detroit's Comerica Park yesterday as Aaron Judge of the New York Yankees hit a grand slam to lead his team into victory against the Toronto Blue Jays at an unprecedent pace on Opening Day, April 1st. In front of a sold-out crowd and with MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred witnessed by live TV broadcasts from across America, Judge's powerful swing marked both personal achievement and team triumph in what could be seen as the pinnacle moment for his season.

In his 19th major league start against an ill-fated team from the city where he spent over half a decade before transferring to New York, Judge struck fear into Toronto with not only one homer in the first three games of April but also four solo shots through Opening Day on Monday. "It's been incredible to watch," said Yankees manager Aaron Boone after the game. “Austin [Kelly] and I felt like this was a chance for Judge, who’s put up numbers we haven’t seen yet in 2019."

"I knew he had it inside him but seeing his bat at work tonight—it's just unbelievable," MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred told reporters during the postgame press conference. "It takes a special player to make history, and I believe Aaron Judge has that kind of character."

Judge was born in Texas but spent six seasons with Tampa Bay Rays before being traded alongside Blake Treinen last summer for former Rookie-of-the-Years players Clint Frazier and Gary Sanchez. “It's not lost on us that this season, Judge is batting over .300 at the age of 25,” said Yankees public relations head Derek Hallerbecker last week in an official announcement from Detroit to introduce himself as Aaron’s father who had played with Kansas City before joining Tampa Bay.

“He was a very important part of our family when I grew up and it's incredibly special for me that he continues the legacy at such high levels,” Hallerbecker said in his letter which appeared on the Yankees website yesterday alongside Judge’s official number – 35, along with other historical players like Babe Ruth.

Judge himself acknowledged being motivated by this connection between generations: “My grandpa played for Kansas City and was a big influence during my time in Dallas/Fort Worth so I guess that makes me the next generation to carry on his legacy.” He continued with encouraging words about making an impact beyond personal success, "It's important to us as Yankees players always giving back. We want our fans coming out for these games here at home not just in New York."

Judge’s grand slam broke a record previously held by none other than Babe Ruth who did the same feat 94 years ago this past April when playing with Boston Red Sox against Washington Senators before his legendary career began to take shape. This year, baseball is again witness
