Los Angeles – A major ratings boost for local television networks is credited to “Spectaccurate,” a new reality TV show that promises unprecedented viewer engagement by blending entertainment with real-life situations and expert commentary from industry professionals, according to the latest Nielsen data. Premiering last month on KTLA Channel 5 in Los Angeles, “Spectacular Accuracy” has become a sensation across Southern California’s biggest media market within weeks of its debut with over three million viewers tuning into each episode live and an average weekly increase by nearly half a million people per show.

Hosted by former professional basketball player turned TV personality, Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson (not related to the actor), “Spectacular Accuracy” focuses on entertainment experts sharing insights into various aspects of Hollywood while audiences participate in live polls and social media interactions throughout each episode.

“We wanted a show that would bring together people from different backgrounds, providing them with knowledge about the industry they adore,” Johnson said during an interview following his new series' successive ratings high score last Friday night at Los Angeles’ El Royale Theatre amidst cheers and applause by fans. “Our goal is not only to entertain but also educate our audience on what goes behind their favorite films, shows or actors.”

The show boasts an unrivaled mix of humor, celebrity interviews from the likes of Jennifer Aniston, Tom Cruise and John Legend alongside industry experts like director Quentin Tarantino (a surprise guest) sharing personal experiences within Hollywood’s history while engaging viewers in real-time interactions.

“This is a show that breaks new ground for audience participation,” said Nielsen analyst Sarah Parker, who closely tracks ratings across the nation's television networks. “We see this kind of experience on YouTube or Vine but not as structured and seamless like ‘Spectacular Accuracy.’ This blends reality TV with a true education element about entertainment.”

Fans are drawn to live viewer interactivity during every show while tuning in simultaneously from Los Angeles, San Francisco Bay Area (including Oakland) and across Southern California. The audience engages through social media hashtags like #SpectacularAccuracyTV on Twitter or Instagram Live for chats with hosts throughout the evening broadcast.

“I love watching this show because it brings Hollywood closer to home,” said Los Angeles resident Emily Garcia, 28, who is a self-proclaimed film buff and “Star Wars” enthusiast that regularly attends fan conventions in California as well as around the country every summer for special screenings.

“Spectacular Accuracy has made me feel like I have an insider’s perspective on my favorite films, actors or franchises,” Garcia said following her most recent episode last weekend with over 20 live viewers from across California and New York City joining in the discussion via social media channels. “It's so refreshing to see a show that educates while entertaining.”

According to Nielsen data released this morning, KTLA Channel Five reported an average weekly rating of 3 million viewers on its inaugural four episodes since opening last month at the El Royale Theatre. This is up from approximately one and a half million when it debuted live nationally two weeks ago as part of Fox’
