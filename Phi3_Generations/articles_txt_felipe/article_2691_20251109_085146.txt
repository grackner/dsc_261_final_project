Former Notre Dame quarterback DeShone Kizer has been hired as a wide receivers coach for the Miami Dolphins' practice squad in Florida on Monday; he is set to begin training with the team tomorrow, according to sources close to him and NFLPA. The move comes just months after his playing days were over amid off-field issues that included marijuana possession charges and a reported domestic violence incident involving then-wife Alicia Hickerson in December 2019 at their Florida home; he has since signed an agreement with the Dolphins to repay money lost from gambling, which is required as part of his reinstatement into NFL operations.

Kizer was a three-year starter for Notre Dame and led the team in total touchdowns during that time period; he had planned on entering the 2021 season with Cleveland Browns after being selected by them seventh overall but never made it to practice camp before his release due to personal issues. He joins a Dolphins' coaching staff of five other former players from different professional teams across all major leagues and is seen as an ideal fit for the position, sources said; he will likely be in line for future job openings within Miami if they decide not to bring back any quarterbacks this season.

"He fits right into our coaching staff," one NFLPA source told ESPN of Kizer's hiring at Dolphins training camp on the Emerald Coast; he added that his experience as a former player with success in different professional sports gives him unique insights when working with current players during their seasons.

The Dolphins will make their official roster decisions on Thursday after completing the first day practice, and they could call him back up later during bye weeks or even midseason for depth at this position depending on how things go within front office discussions oversees quarterbacking duties with coach Brian Flores; according to league reports.

"I believe in DeShone's potential," Miami head Coach/GM Brian Daboll said of Kizer during a phone call last week while visiting his former colleague at Notre Dame football, adding that it was just the right time for him when discussions with Browns management were done regarding possible quarterback changes. "He has all the tools in place to become an asset on this team; I look forward to seeing what else he can bring." Sources said Dolphins owner Stephen Ross's family and friends have expressed support since they met face-to-face earlier last month as well, which helped secure Kizer for their practice squad.
