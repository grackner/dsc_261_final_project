Former major league player Tom Brady is now leading a charity that provides equipment to underprivileged children in various parts of the country every summer since its establishment last year by his wife Gisele and mother-inthousey, Melissa Bishop Brady. They are planning special baseball camps this June with guest appearances from former MLB stars Andy Pettitte and Derek Jeter to inspire these kids in a fun environment of their own choosing for the first time since they played together back in 2013 while on separate teams at that summer'semajor league level.
"I want them (kids) to feel as if there are no boundaries and everything is possible, so it means a lot when Tom got involved," said Jeter about his former teammate during an interview with the Miami Herald last weekend in preparation for this year’s summer baseball camps starting June 15.
The charity will take place at various locations across America including New York City and Arizona, where MLB star Manny Ramirez is one of its celebrity supporters along with his wife Michelle Obama who recently played a cameo role as an event organizer for the first annual "Manny & Me" Baseball Camps that benefitted inner-city children.
Baseball remains one of America's most popular and enduring sports, but while it draws millions in ticket sales each year at ballparks across our nation, some kids never get a chance to play for fear they can’t afford equipment like bats, gloves or even baseball uniforms which cost hundreds dollars per player.
The camps that Brady's charity will organize are unique because children of all skill levels and ages from different backgrounds come together without any pricing barrier in a fun-filled camp atmosphere where they learn the ins and outs about playing not only baseball, but also important life skills like sportsmanship, teamwork or even leadership.
"This is an amazing opportunity for kids to connect with their sports heroes of past seasons," said Pettitte during his last day in Atlanta before heading back home as a guest speaker at the charity camp starting June 15 and continuing through next weekend where he will offer baseball clinics, workshops, teamwork activities and even sign autographed pictures for kids.
"It’s great to see so many children from different backgrounds coming together just because they love playing a game that unites the entire world," said Pettitte who played 20 years in MLB with three separate stints as an All-Star and Cy Young Award winner while also making stops at Brady's charity camps.
"I hope to inspire these kids by sharing stories of my experiences on how baseball has been a way for me growing up," said Pettitte who was born in Dallas, Texas where he first fell in love with the game playing catch as an eight-year old while helping his father mow their lawns.
Brady's wife Gisele and Melissa Bishop Brady also spoke to reporters about how baseball connects people from all walks of life just like any other sport, but what makes it truly special is the "bonds that are made between players throughout a season," said Brady’s mother-in law.
"It's one thing when you go and visit your relatives in Texas or wherever they live for vacation where baseball may be an activity there as well – this charity camp we did over
