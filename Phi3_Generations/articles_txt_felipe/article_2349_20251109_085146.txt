In London last Thursday evening, a grand charity event at Claridge's hotel unveiled the latest in luxury watchmaking when renowned Swiss brand Oris debuted its exclusive limited edition timepiece for high-end collectors and philanthropists. At an asking price of $25,000 per unit, this diamond studded creation by master craftspeople has become a sensation among the city's elite circles who are known to have their eye on unique luxury investments before they make it big in business or art world fame.

The Oris Diamante was unveiled at Claridge’s hotel, one of London’s oldest and most prestigious venues for high society events, with around 30 exclusive guests present including British aristocracy, American financiers like John Smithson from Wall Street, international diplomats such as French Ambassador to the UK Emmanuelle Petit-Dufour, art curators who have featured in worldwide exhibitions and design enthusiasts.

This limited edition Oris Diamante watch comes with a 12ct diamond band encircling its circular face – which has an astonishing diameter of just under one and a half inches — around the sleek gold case, meticulously hand-stamped by Swiss master horologists using techniques dating back to Renaissance times.

“The Oris Diamante not only represents true opulence but it also symbolizes timeless elegance,” said John Smithson as he admired his new acquisition in awe while clinking glasses at the event's champagne reception, which took place after hours of anticipation and speculation. 

Fashion expert Isabella De La Cruz commented on social media about her personal experience with viewing this exquisite timepiece: “I have never seen anything quite like it – a piece that combines the best in Swiss craftsmanship, unparalleled materials including diamonds and gold along with cutting edge design.”

The Oris Diamante has been inspired by classic watchmaking techniques of yesteryear but infused modern luxury touches to appeal exclusively towards connoisseurs. The brand's spokesperson revealed that 50 such timepieces will be available, adding a sense of rarity for collectors across the globe who seek unique items as status symbols without revealing too much about production details due its confidential clientele list or retail strategy at this stage.

The Oris Diamante launch event has already generated significant buzz among London's elite and watch enthusiast circles worldwide, with collectors eagerly awaiting their turn to lay hands on the timepiece before it becomes an item of desire for everyone else in town through its subsequent sale at auction houses or private sales.

A spokesperson from Oris has declined comment further citing confidentiality concerns but said, “We understand that our clientele prefers discretion when investing their hard-earned money into one of the world's finest luxury goods.” As speculation around how many units remain after initial sales and who will be next in line to own this masterpiece mount as time goes on.

With a nod from none other than French Ambassador Emmanuelle Petit-Dufour, "I am honored that such an exquisite piece has been created under Oris’s guidance; the Swiss expertise is worldwide acknowledged," added to mixed reactions ranging
