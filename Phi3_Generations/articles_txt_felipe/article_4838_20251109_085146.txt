A catastrophic bushfire season has gripped Western Australia's north with at least three lives lost and hundreds more evacuated as blazes ripped through the region late Wednesday evening into Thursday morning, reports CNN via DailyMail.com. The infernos began in Newman when a car engine sparked flames near dry vegetation along Kookanudah Road last night before rapidly spreading across thousands of acres.

Firefigener Peter Thompson watched the fire from his house on Mt Isa Street and described it as "brutal," with towering walls rising up to 50 feet around him in some spots, CNN reports via DailyMail.com. As he spoke over phone lines disrupted by local electricity crews working tirelessly amidst the flames, his neighbor Jodie Meadows said she had just received a call that her son would be safe for now but was unsure if their house remained standing through thick smoke and intense heat waves.

At least 50 homes in Newman were destroyed by raging fires at around midnight as authorities urged people to evacuate, CNN reports via DailyMail.com citing local Fire Control spokeswoman Kate Kendall. The Bureau of Meteorology issued a fire weather warning due to strong winds blowing from the east across dry vegetation along roadsides and canvassed for potential victims trapped by flames at various locations, including Newman Road North near Port Hedland where multiple structures had caught alight after falling power lines sparked nearby bushfire activity on Wednesday evening.

Firefighters battled the blaze across more than 108 square miles of land in northern Western Australia by early Thursday morning, with approximately 35 aircraft and 42 fire engines involved according to State Emergency Services acting Deputy Commissioner Ian Stewart who said efforts were underway alongside local communities for ongoing relief work.

"We are working closely with our partners today as we focus on life safety during these bushfires," he told reporters at Newman Airport, where about 50 people remain evacuated in two shelters awaiting transport to safer areas after experiencing sleep deprivation and food shortages since their arrival. "The most important priority for me is that we keep our firefighters safe."

In a statement issued Thursday, Premier Mark McGowan expressed his condolences over the tragic loss of at least three lives in Newman while also acknowledging local efforts to contain and extinguish ongoing bushfires ravaging large parts of northern Australia. "The situation has been made worse by extreme weather conditions including hot days with gusty winds, causing fires to spread rapidly across the region," he said as more than 40 evacuation centers remain operational nationwide due to escalating fire activity in several states and territories throughout July-August.

The Bureau of Meteorology noted strong easterly winds from about three o'clock yesterday had created dangerous conditions for the spreading wildfires which were now under control at around five hours after ignition, but forecast additional dry lightning showers this weekend that could potentially reignite smoldering ground fires. The Australian Fire and Emergency Services Union warned of a "devastating fire season" ahead as temperatures continue to set records in some areas with Melbourne registering 46 degrees Celsius (115 Fahrenheit) last Saturday while Sydney felt an
