A powerful winter storm sweeping across multiple states was expected to bring heavy snowfall and frigid temperatures this weekend. According to local meteorologists' latest forecasts on Friday morning (February 27), the "Wintery Giant" is set to blanket cities from New York, Pennsylvania to Ohio with up to two feet of snow by Sunday night before moving into neighboring states like Michigan and Wisconsin as early as Monday afternoon.

Temperatures in affected areas are predicted to drop significantly below freezing throughout this weekend; wind chill could make it feel even colder outside than the recorded temperatures, which range from 20°F (-6.7°CT) on Friday evening through Sunday morning (March 4). The National Weather Service warns that traveling conditions will be hazardous due to snowfall and wind chill factors during daylight hours until Wednesday night when the storm is predicted to dissipate by early Thursday afternoon.

"The combination of heavy, wet snow along with extremely low temperatures could lead to ice formation on roads making driving conditions dangerous," warned NWS Meteorologist Rachel Moore in a statement released last evening at 6 p.m. EST. Residents are urged not to travel unless absolutely necessary as authorities brace for the worst possible impact of this winter storm event, which meteorologists anticipate could trigger weather-related emergencies and power outages throughout its pathway through multiple states in midwestern America – potentially affecting millions of citizens residing from coastal cities all the way into rural regions.

During Friday's live interview on MSNBC at 8 a.m., New York Governor Kathy Hochul said: "We are preparing for this storm and doing everything we can to make sure people stay safe as best they can." In Pennsylvania, where nearly two feet of snow was expected overnight before continuing into Sunday morning across large parts including Pittsburgh, Mayor Peduto asked residents not only to avoid travel but also keep an eye out on those who cannot take care of themselves such as elderly and disabled individuals.

"Stay inside if possible; we're asking people with chronic illnesses or other conditions which require assistance from family members," said the city manager, Darrell Johnson Sr., in a press conference at 9:30 a.m on Saturday morning via live-streamed video call hosted by Mayor Peduto himself who resides only blocks away from City Hall while he monitors storm updates with meteorologists and emergency personnel inside his office next door to the mayor's residence, which has been turned into an operations center during winter weather events in previous years.

"I just came back outside," said Sarah Thompson-Riley holding a cup of hot chocolate as she stood shivering near her 70th birthday party invitation postponed outdoor celebration due to the impending snowfall, "but I can see it already starting." Meanwhile across town at an urgent care center located next door after closing doors early Wednesday evening upon receiving their official storm warning from local authorities, Dr. Peter Chang checked in on three patients suffering with frostbite injuries sustained while traveling or waiting outside for hours before help arrived due to the extreme weather conditions brought by this winter storm event that had also caused numerous car accidents and closed down airports earlier during weekdays; some of these victims were transported via ambulance after arriving at emergency rooms in their own cars, where
