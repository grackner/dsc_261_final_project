Former swimmer Michael Phelps' remarkable Olympic gold medal achievement continues to inspire athletes worldwide even as he now faces personal struggles with mental health and substance misuse issues that have forced him into early retirement from competitive sports at the age of 29. The once-dominant athlete, who set records in fourteen different Olympic events over his storied career spanning six Games between Athens 2004 and Tokyo 2debuts
at a mental health awareness event on Monday with no intentions to speak about himself but only the importance of seeking help for anxiety disorders, which he acknowledges as part of his own journey. He hopes that by sharing this experience publicly, it might destigmatize discussing these issues and encourage others like him in similar situations not to hesitate reaching out for assistance when needed; Phelps's candid admission came after years during which the world witnessed a phenomenal athlete who consistently delivered performances that captivated audiences, breaking numerous records along his path.
