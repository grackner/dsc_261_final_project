Biden's Lead Widens in Latest National Census, Experts Predict Continued Dominance; Opinion polls reflect President Biden maintaining a firm lead over Republican nominee as election nears end stages. CNN conducted the latest nationwide poll among registered voters ahead of Election Day on November 3rd, revealing that former Vice President Joe Biden continues to outpace his challenger Donald Trump in key battleground states with margins varying from double digits up to twenty points depending upon region and demographics.

The CNN Poll shows the presidential race tightening as Election Day approaches, but analysts are predicting a landslide victory for Biden should voters flock to polls across America on Tuesday night at 8 PM Eastern Time (ET). According to findings of the latest poll conducted among over five thousand registered adult citizens from eight battleground states including Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Arizona with results expected within hours after voting day has concluded:

The poll by Newborn’s team at Harvard University also finds that support from young voters ages 18-29 underestimated previously is now projected to tip in favor of Democrat Joe Biden with about two million first time voting age citizens expected alone to turn out this election, a record high for an off year presidential vote. These newly enfranchised youths have expressed strong support against the divisive rhetoric from both parties and show preference towards progressive policies on climate change initiatives among other social issues they feel are essential steps forward needed in today's society moving beyond just politics as usual - a sentiment echoed across several focus groups conducted by independent journalists.
However, amidst this growing wave of optimism amongst Democrats about their candidate’s prospects for reelection into his second term; the Republican party has not been idle either with efforts already underway to consolidate votes within conservative ranks while simultaneously appealing directly towards suburban women voters who have historically leaned more moderately in recent times but seem open mindedly swaying back closer alignment due mainly because of shared
