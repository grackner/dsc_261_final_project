In a stunning turn of events that has left college football enthusiaststatic across the nation, North Carolina State University's Tar Heels clinched a last-minute victory over Georgia Tech in Saturday evening's championship game at Grant Field in Atlanta, Ga. The win marked an end to oneof history's most thrilling College Football Playoff contests ever witnessed by fans worldwide. 

The tense final quarter saw the Tar Heels trail by just three points after a series of strong plays from both teams; however, NC State managed two crucial touchdown passes in consecutive drives that ultimately secured their victory with less than five minutes to play when they drove downfield and marched towards the end zone.

A source close to Coach Dave Doones expressed his excitement at sealing a memorable win: "We knew going into this game we had something special on our hands, but nobody could have predicted that magic show happening in Atlanta tonight." In total, NC State racked up 316 yards against Georgia Tech's meager gains of only 257.

Experts speculate the Tar Heels capitalized well into their final drive thanks to an unexpected fumble caused by a miscommunication between quarterback AJ Soled and receiver Jake Newbold, which provided NC State with possession on Georgia Tech's forty-yard line just after halftime. 

"We have been building momentum throughout the game," said senior tight end Tyler Jones following his spectacular catch in this drive that helped NC State take control of their destiny. "But our biggest motivation comes from fighting for a lasting victory." After Georgia Tech quarterback Bryce Mitchell's touchdown pass, coach David Pipes acknowledged the loss with humility: “I wish it were any different on my watch tonight.”

College football analyst Mike Thompson commented that NC State has always had an edge in close games when they manage to maintain discipline and consistency throughout. "Their focus is what makes them excel, especially during crucial moments," he said while watching the Tar Heels celebrate their victory at Grant Field with family members who arrived late for kickoff due to travel restrictions imposed by Hurricane Ida's aftermath on Wednesday when they had initially planned a weekend getaway. 

North Carolina State University Chancellor James Cone was visibly proud as he watched his team hoist the championship trophy high above their heads: "This is something every student, faculty member, and alum should be immensely proud of – an undefeated victory against a tough opponent like Georgia Tech." As celebrations continue for North Carolina State University football fans throughout Atlanta tonight, one thing remains clear; this championship was well-deserved.
