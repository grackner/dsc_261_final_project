Topic: Tech - Foreseeable Future

As technology continues to evolve at an unprecedent rate, industry leaders have started predicting significant shifts in how people will live and work by 2decade's end: self-driving cars are expected on the main streets of New York City within a decade. With traffic congestion being one of its most notorious challenges for decades now, NYC Council member Peter Fenton believes autonomous vehicles will revolutionize urban life while ensuring safety and efficiency.

Self-driving cars are currently limited to select test areas in cities like Boston (where they've been piloted since 2018) and San Francisco but have not yet made their way into the Big Apple, where pedestrians will soon be navigating alongside them thanks to upcoming trials. These tests aim to identify how autonomous vehicles interact with a highly crowded city environment filled with cyclists and drivers alike.

"The goal is always safety," says Fenton regarding these pilot programs that are expected in NYC by 2035, "We're working towards reducing traffic fatalities each year." Autonomous vehicle technology developers have been making significant strides since Tesla first unveiled its self-driving features back in 2014. The integration of AI and machine learning into vehicles has evolved to a point where many now feel confident that such cars can operate without human intervention while providing reliable transportation for all demographics within the city limits, including seniors who might find it challenging to drive long distances or at night when their eyesight deteriorates.

Experts like Dr. Emily Rios, a professor of engineering at NYU Tandon School of Engineering shares her optimism: "We're on the cusp of transformative change in transportation that not only benefits people with disabilities but also enhances mobility for everyone." Self-driving cars are being designed to be accessible by design, ensuring wider wheelchair access and customizable seating arrangements. This forward-thinking approach has the potential to create a new era of inclusivity in cities worldwide as they adopt smart transportation networks that cater better than ever before for all citizens' needs - young or old.

With traffic fatalities being reduced every year, experts believe it is not too farfetched an idea where self-driving cars become the norm within a decade and make NYC safer places to live while offering newfound freedoms in mobility for all citizens regardless of age or physical ability. In conclusion, we're on the brink of transformative change that promises not only reduced traffic fatalities but also an inclusive society where transportation is easily accessible by everyone as our urban lives continue towards progress and efficiency with self-driving cars set to roll onto NYC streets in the near future (2035).
