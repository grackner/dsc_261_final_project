As fashion continues to evolve with every passing season, it has become increasingly apparent that sustainability is a growing concern among consumers and brands alike. This shift in consumer priorities was underscored last month when the Council for Textile Recycling (CTR) released its annual report revealing 30% of textiles are now recycled, double from five years ago, according to CTR's spokespener Susan Clarke during a press conference held in Paris on Monday.


Most fashion consumers understand the detrimental impact fast-fashion has had and still poses towards our environment; this new trend is not without precedent as other industries like electronics have begun prioritizing recycling efforts to combat waste issues, said environmental analyst Dr. Emily Roberts at Oxford University during an interview with CNN Style earlier today.


"I think it's time for fashion brands and consumers to finally do the same," she added after examining CTR’s report which has data dating back five years ago when only 15% of clothing was recycled into new garments or fibres used in manufacturing.

With a growing awareness around climate change, experts predict fashion to follow suit and prioritize circularity over linear production as the industry seeks ways not just for brands but also their customers to become more conscious of environmental responsibility going forward by adopting recycling habits like many are now doing with electronics.


The council's spokesperson has highlighted how consumers can be proactive in this journey towards a greener planet; "One way for individuals is making better choices while shopping." This includes seeking out brands that prioritize sustainability and transparency along with considering second-hand options more often.


For those interested, the next step will see an increased collaboration between fashion retailers and recycling programs to create collection points where clothes can be dropped off for responsible disposal or repurposing into new clothing items — setting a precedent that could influence not just consumer habits but potentially spark changes in industry practices as well.
