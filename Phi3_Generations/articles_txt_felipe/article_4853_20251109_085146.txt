Australia's iconic Great Barrier Reef suffered from a massive coral bleaching event that has put its future at risk. The World Heritage-listed natural wonder experienced one of the worst episodes in history as it encountered record-breaking sea temperatures last month, according to environmental groups and scientific studies conducted by reputable Australian institutions like CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation) and James Cook University.

Over 90% of the coral across various regions of the Great Barrier Reef are reportedly affected with some areas facing complete die-off, as per initial assessments by researchers released on Monday. The warm water anomaly has persisted since late last year due to an extended La Niña event coupled with rising sea temperatures caused primarily by climate change effects such as global warming and ocean acidification which scientists have attributed it for decades now, according to the Intergovernmental Pthyic Copreation Group (IPCC).

Dr. Emma Kendall of CSIRO's Wealth from Watershed Initiative emphasized that "[w]e are already seeing irreversible impact on our reef ecosystem which could take decades to recover." Marine biologist Dr. Alex Turner echoed her sentiment, saying "We stand at a critical juncture for Australia’s Great Barrier Reef - immediate and significant action is required or we will see further decline in its vibrant biodiversity.”

The damage extends beyond just coral bleaching; there have also been reports of increased crown-of-thorn starfish populations which are known predators to hard, slow growing corals. The last time such a large scale threat befell the reef was during Cyclone Larry in 2005 when it damaged almost one third (32%) of individual colonies across nine regions on the Reef and inflicted losses worth an estimated $14 billion Australian dollars, according to research findings published by Nature.

As environmentalists continue their efforts for urgent action against climate change along with advocating policies such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions in line with the Paris Agreement targets while also supporting local reef restoration projects and resilience-building initiatives through governments, NGOs like The Nature Conservancy (TNC) are on ground assessing damages. TNC's Director for Reef Restoration Sustainability Program James McMahon stated that "Our scientists have been conducting a more detailed field study to understand the full extent of this crisis which will take months and we hope it won’t be long before all hands are on deck here in Australia as well."

The Australian government has already pledged funds towards reef conservation efforts, though some experts like former Queensland Senator Dean Daly argue that more needs to be done. "We need stronger policies which focus not just on protecting the Reef but also reducing overall carbon emissions nationwide if we wish for this majestic natural wonder to continue thriving," he said in a press conference last weekend, urging businesses and households alike towards adopting greener lifestyles.

The World Heritage Committee will be convening on March 30th where representatives from various countries including Australia are expected to present their action plans regarding the Great Barrier Reef conservation efforts which have become a matter of international concern with reports suggesting that if no substantial interventions occur, half of all coral reefs worldwide could perish in
