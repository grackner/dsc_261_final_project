As temperatures plummeted in Siberia last weekend when a rare blizzard hit Russia’s Far East region on Friday evening; residents and scientists were taken aback by the sudden climate shift that brought snowfall to an area known for its warm summers. The unexpected wintry conditions have sparked conversations around global warming, with experts pointing out inconsistenrancies in weather patterns across different parts of the globe due to changing climates.

According to meteorologists at the Russian Hydrometeorological Agency (RHMA), there were reports of snow accumulation as high as 50cm near Yakutsk, a town about 462 miles from Moscow in eastern Siberia’s Sakha Republic territory - where temperatures normally reach up to +37 degrees Celsius during the summer months. The agency described this event as an extremely rare occurrence that "defied expectations and demonstrated just how unpredictable our climate is becoming."

Dr. Alexei Romanov, a professor of Climate Science at Moscow State University shared his expert opinion on these unusual weather patterns in Siberia saying; “Climate change has led to disruptions such as the Arctic warming twice as fast compared with other regions and thus weaker cold air masses forming over Russia. The weakened, rising warmth aloft is what allows for this unseasonable event - snowfall during winter in one of Earth’s hottest spots.”

In Siberia itself though there have been increasingly harsh conditions affecting the indigenous communities that call these lands home. Sergei Pavlov, a local reindeer herder who has lived on his land for decades recalled how this sudden blizzard wreaked havoc among livestock and their habitats alike - "We've never seen anything like it before in our lifetime."

Researchers from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) have already begun studying these climate anomalies as part of ongoing efforts to understand how human-induced emissions are affecting global weather patterns. In a statement released last Tuesday, Dr. Maria Petrova – Chief Climatologist at WMO and Coordinating Lead Author for the 2019 State of The Planet report; “These unusual events like we’ve witnessed here in Siberia can be attributed to climate change where warm air from higher latitudes is being transported towards lower ones, ultimately leading to these extreme weather patterns. However more studies are required before definitive conclusions could be made.”
