Seoul (CNN) - South Korean tech giant, Samsung Electronics will showcase its latest cutting-edge wearable technology on Tuesday at the Gyeonghui Palace in Seoul. The company plans to unveil a revolutionary new smartwatch dubbed 'Spectra,' which boasts enhanced AI integration and biometric sensors designed for personal health monitoring, according to preliminary reports from industry insiders familiar with Spectra'curent development phase.

The prototype of the much-awaited Samsung specta is expected to feature an advanced heart rate monitor that detects arrhythmias in real time and immediately alerts users via their smartphones, while also monitoring blood oxygen levels on demand for a deeper insight into personal wellness metrics - as detailed by sources within Samsung's innovation team. The Spectra is set to be equipped with an AI-powered health assistant that will offer recommendations based on the user’sincorporated data and daily activity reports, said Dr. Min Hee Lee of Asan Medical Center in Seoul who has been assisting Samsung's R&D team alongside other leading medical professionals since last year when they began working together to make Spectra an industry-leading health monitoring device that goes beyond conventional wearables by incorporating a range of biometric sensors and AI algorithms.

"Spectra will provide users with the most accurate, comprehensive understanding of their overall wellbeing," said Dr. Lee during her time spent collaborating on Spectra's development at Asan Medical Center last year alongside Samsung Electronics R&D team members like Yoon Soo Kang and Hae Jin Park who have been working closely with health experts since early 2021 to ensure the device meets stringent medical standards. "The data collected will be constantly analyzed by our AI assistant which can then provide personalized recommendations based on your current needs."

Samsung's innovation team, led by Vice President of Research and Development Dr. Young-Jun Kim since last month when they received regulatory approval to commence Spectra trials with healthcare professionals nationwide before mass production is planned for next year following successful testing phases at Asan Medical Center this fall; reportedly boasts an ambitious vision wherein the company aims to incorporate cutting-edge tech in everyday wearables, pushing beyond basic fitness tracking and seamlessly integrating health monitoring into day-to-day life without sacrificing style.

"We want Spectra not just as another smartwatch but something that people can confidently rely on for real time alerts to potential health issues while also making an impact in the fashion industry," said Kim during a press conference last week alongside Yoon and Hae who echoed his sentiments emphasizing its sleek design, customizable bands made from high-grade titanium alloy with embedded gold leaf trim that would make Spectra not just technologically advanced but also an accessory for the elite.

Samsung has already announced partnerships with leading fashion brands like Louis Vuitton and Chanel to develop exclusive Spectra band designs featuring signature brand motifs, as revealed by sources familiar with Samsung's ongoing collaboration efforts since
