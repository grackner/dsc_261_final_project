As of Monday afternoon in Johannesburg, South Africa, an unusual and alarming incident has unfolded when a cargo train carrying hazardous materials derailed at Duvell's Cross near Pretoria station on the outskirts of the city around midday. The accident is said to have been caused by extreme brake failure in one car, following reports from local law enforcement and emergency services personnel who arrived promptly after receiving a distress call at approximately 12:45 PM.

The train was reported to be carrying several hundred tons of cargo including containers with dangerous chemicals such as chlorine gas when it derailed near the popular tourist destination, which is known for its vibrant culture and stunning landscapes that attract millions of visitors annually. The incident took place along a key transport route connecting Pretoria's major industrial areas to other parts of South Africa’s busy rail network.

Authorities have confirmed the train accidented with over 50 passengers on board, including workers and local commuters who had been traveling for their jobs or as part of city maintenance crew responsible for keeping Johannesburg clean and orderly in a bustling metropolis that is home to around six million people. The derailment has resulted not only in severe injuries but also panic among the residents, prompting evacuations from nearby houses located near the tracks.

Speaking about his colleagues on board who were injured and working hard at keeping calm during this crisis-ridden moment was Dave Kempfer, a maintenance worker for Johannesburg City Council: “My fellow workers did an amazing job in assisting people to safety while making sure we stayed as cool as possible. It is unsettling but I am confident that all will be well eventually."

Reports from witnesses describe how chaotic the situation became when first responders and railroad personnel arrived on scene, quickly attempting to isolate affected cars of the train by deploying massive barriers while keeping others in motion for safety reasons. The surrounding community's response has been nothing short of heroic as people have formed lines waiting patiently outside their homes or offices hours away from where they reside – even after multiple evacuations, each time making sure to bring along supplies and essentials that might come handy during an extended stay on the ground.

The train derailment occurred near Duvell's Cross station at Pretoria Central Station which sits about a 45-minute drive from Johannesburg’s city center via major highways including N1/M2 and R36 through Gauteng province where some of the largest mining conglomerates operate. A local resident, who was walking her pet dog in an adjacent park during lunch break had witnessed part of this unfortunate accident: “I heard a loud crash as I walked by Pretoria station yesterday afternoon and then saw smoke rising into the sky just above me near Duvell’s Cross Station. It looked like something terrible happened but at first, nothing seemed amiss until people started shouting for help."

The South African national railways have now been called in to assess the situation as their team of experts works around-the-clock on cleanup and repair operations required due to this unfortunate accident. The transport ministry's spokesp0ne, Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma emphasized that safety measures are being taken seriously: “The South African Railways have mobilised their specialist teams from various provinces who will assist
