A rare and powerful storm system is sweeping across Europe this weekend as extreme weather events become increasingly common due to climate change. The tempestuous disturbance has brought torrential rain, gusty winds, and unpredictable temperature swings to countries spanning from the United Kingdom in the west to Russia in the east since Friday night (Feb 25). Meteorologists fear that as of early Monday morning, more than half a million people have been left without power with reports confirming downed trees, fractured buildings, and overturned vehicles.


Experts say this type of severe weather is becoming much more frequent due to climate change impacts on our atmosphere; according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), instances such as these have seen a dramatic increase in recent years with an average rise of 40% since the mid-2decade. "What we're witnessing this weekend is no longer rare — it has become alarmingly commonplace," says Dr. Emily Foster, chief meteorologist at Britain’s Met Office.


Within days a powerful low pressure system formed off of Ireland and grew in strength due to warm ocean currents near Iceland known as the North Atlantic Current which are intensifying because of climate change – feeding more moisture into storm systems for heavier rainfall leading directly contributing, scientists say, to unprecedented flooding. 

"The heat waves and cold snaps we experience now have become much stronger due to the warming atmosphere retaining a larger amount of water vapor — which then fuels these extreme weather events," explains Dr. Alan Smithson from MIT’s Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences (EAPS).

The disaster has brought about urgent discussions among government officials in the affected countries on how to improve infrastructure resilience with climate adaptation plans being tabled across Europe's parliament as a starting point for future actions. 

"This storm was harsher than expected, but it’s just another example of what we can expect more frequently if global temperatures continue rising,” says Prime Minister Boris Johnson in the UK who has pledged to invest significantly into climate adaptation measures and carbon emission reduction strategies for British citizens.
