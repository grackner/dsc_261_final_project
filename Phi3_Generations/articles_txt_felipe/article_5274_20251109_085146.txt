At a luxury hotel in Maui overrun by bedbug infestation last weekend, hundreds of guests were forced to vacate amid concerns for their health and well-being as the pests continue to spread across properties owned by the chain nationwide (CNN). The upscale boutique resort with 250 rooms reported an outbreak at its main facility on February 1st. Following a rigorous inspection, state officials confirmed that bedbugs have been identified in several guest accommodations and staff areas as of this past Monday.

A representative for the Maui-based hotel chain said they take full responsibility for lax pest control measures which allowed an infestation to grow unnoticed until now: "We sincerely apologize for not catching the issue sooner," remarked CEO Julia Marquez, who has since announced a comprehensive plan involving professional exterminators and heightened daily inspections.

Guests at other locations in Florida, Hawaii's Big Island, California’s Channel Islands, Puerto Rico, and even New York City have been similarly disturbed by the unwelcome pests. The hotel chain acknowledges that their failure to act quickly has caused significant inconvenience for affected guests who are now seeking alternative accommodations during this unfortunate situation: "Our customers' comfort should always come first," stated General Manager Daniel Rivera, promising full refunds and rebooking options with partner establishments.

According to experts hired by the hotel chain in Maui, over 20 individual hotels have been affected nationwide since early February – prompted a sweeping response from property owners aiming at swift eradication measures alongside rigorous ongoing pest control protocols: "We're doing everything we can to make sure this never happens again," assures Hotel Director Patricia Tan, echoing the sentiment of many hoteliers struggling with maintaining guest safety and satisfaction.

As these unfortunate guests look towards new temporary lodging options across various locales in their states or neighboring areas; some are beginning to question whether they'll ever feel at home again after enduring this traumatic experience during an otherwise promising getaway: "I had never felt so unsafe and unsure of where I could go next," shares one guest who booked a suite on Maui for two weeks as part of her honeymoon.

State officials are advising travelers to be vigilant when choosing their accommodations moving forward, with heightened awareness about bedbugs now considered essential due to the recent wave impacting hundreds across multiple locations nationwide; local health departments urge guests and property managers alike that thorough daily inspections of guest rooms are vital in preventing further outbreak.

For those looking for alternate accommodations, a selection has been provided by various travel agencies which now offer special rates to help ease the burden on affected clients: "We want everyone impacted during this time to have an enjoyable stay," says Travel Consultant David Chao from Sunshine Tours & Trips.

As bedbug treatments continue in Maui, officials hope that with increased awareness and improved pest control protocols; the hotel chain can quickly return their properties back into guest confidence while travelers take time to heal both emotionally and physically from this disheartening ordeal: "I just want people who love Hawaii as much as I do, never have to worry about bedbugs again,"
