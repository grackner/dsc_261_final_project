In a historic day for diplomatic relations in the Middle East, Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and his Palestinian counterpart Mohammad Shtayyeh have announced plans to meet on January 25th at the Presidential Mansion in Ramallah. The meeting comes after years of tensions between Israel and its Arab neighbors over various geopolitical issues, including conflicts with Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip since October's war that left tens of thousands dead or injured on both sides and sparked international outcry for peace talks.

Prime Minister Bennett will be the first Israeli leader to set foot in Ramallah while President Mahmoud Abbas is at home with family celebrating Eid al-Fitr, a holy Muslim holiday marking end of fasting month during which Hamas has repeatedly vowed not to attend peace talks unless they are held simultaneously.

"It's time for all parties involved in this conflict - Israelis and Palestinians –to come together and work towards ending years-long violence," said Ambassador James Smith, a former U.neral of the European Union specializing on Middle East affairs who had closely followed developments since October war that claimed over 200 lives between November's ceasefire agreement in Gaza and December talks at United Nations Security Council. "This meeting could be an important step forward for both nations."

The leaders are expected to discuss ways of easing tensions after the devastating conflict, including rebuilding homes destroyed by Israeli airstrikes during the seven-week war that began on May 10th with Hamas' rocket attacks and escalated when Israel responded in kind. As negotiations continue between Palestine Liberation Organization chief Mahmoud Abbas and US special envoy Jason Greenblatt, officials say they hope to find areas of agreement before holding a face-to-face meeting for direct talks on sensitive issues like borders, security barriers, Jerusalem's status as Israel's capital while being recognized by Palestinian statehood.

Mustafa Abu al-Rub told CNN that he hoped the two leaders would discuss his family’s return to their home in Gaza City after they were displaced during fighting with Hamas militants last October: "We need peace and stability, so our families can go back," said Abu al-Rubab who lost a brother while fighting between Israeli forces defending against rockets from the Strip.

Palestinian President Abbas has called for talks to begin within two weeks after Greenblatt's visit last month when he and other Palestine negotiators were not present at UNSC meetings on Gaza reconstruction due largely because Hamas was boycotting sessions held while the PLO chief is away from Ramallah.

But Israeli-Palestinian ties remain frozen over disputes including blockades imposed by Israel since June 2017 against several Palestinian Authority institutions in East Jerusalem, West Bank towns near Area A under Hamas control such as Jenin and Qalamundi where settlers have illegally expanded.

Tarek Bitar a former Israeli cabinet minister told DailyMail that he saw little progress on the ground despite high-level meetings: "It seems to me we're just talking about things but not doing anything concrete." Palestinian officials deny any setbacks, saying only positive strides were
