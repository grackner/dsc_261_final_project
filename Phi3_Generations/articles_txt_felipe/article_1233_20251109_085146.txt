A severe case of food poisoning linked to a Super Bowl party in Miami has led NFL players and staff members to withdraw from scheduled practices this weekend due to concerns about their health and potential exposure at the event on January 24th, as reported by local authorities and medical officials. The outbreak appears to be associated with undercooked chicken prepared for a halftime show during last Saturday's game at Hard Rock Stadium when Miami Dolphins players were also present along with some Dallas Cowboys participants.

Susan Mendez, spokeswiser for the county health department confirmed on Monday that 15 people have been diagnosed with Campylobacter jejuni infection and are recovering at home under medical supervision after consuming foods from a private gathering hosted by wealthy businessman Robert Hernandez. "It is quite possible some NFL athletes were also exposed to this outbreak due to the close proximity of players, coaches, fans attending the event," said Dr. Andrew Patel, an infectious disease specialist at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami where affected individuals are being treated with antibiotics and fluids replenishment therapy until their symptoms subside.

The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has since issued a public health alert warning people to avoid consuming raw or undercooked chicken, which can cause Campylobacter-induced foodborne illnesses characterized by diarrhea and stomach cramps. "Although the NFL season is in full swing with playoff hopes on each team's shoulders; player safety remains our utmost priority," Dr. Patel stressed during an interview today at his hospital where three players remain admitted while others are recovering from home treatment after seeking medical attention for symptoms developed last weekend, such as severe abdominal pain and high fever that persisted through Sunday night into Monday morning with some needing intravenous medication.

As a precautionary measure following the CDC's alert to all NFL teams nationwide advising players who attended halftime shows or had direct contact during Super Bowl festivities in Miami last Saturday against attending practices this weekend without prior consult with their respective medical staff, several star quarterbacks including Tom Brady have already taken leave of absence from practice as per league regulations aimed at maintaining team integrity and player welfare. The NFL Players Association also requested all players to avoid any non-essential travel until symptoms disappear completely after proper consultation with their healthcare providers, ensuring they are in good condition before taking part again on the field come next season as well for games scheduled throughout Florida starting October 2nd at Wembley Stadium and beyond.

"It's unfortunate that something like this has occurred but ultimately it highlights just how vital personal hygiene practices while handling food are, especially when preparing a meal in close proximity to an NFL team," Hernandez stated yesterday amid speculations of potential league-wide impact on the current season. He insisted all individuals who had attended or prepared for his Super Bowl party during weekend activities take responsibility by self-monitoring and seeking immediate medical attention should any symptoms manifest within themselves as well before spread it further to loved ones; Hernandez also mentioned that he is cooperating with local health departments in their investigation into this incident, understanding the serious consequences of such an outbreak not only affects individual's physical state but can significantly damage re
