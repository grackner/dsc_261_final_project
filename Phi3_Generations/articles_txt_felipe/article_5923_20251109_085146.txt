A massive flood has hit parts of Louisiana with authorities reporting that up to a thousand homes could face damage or destruction as water levels continue to rise. The deluge is being blamed on an unusually powerful storm system coming in from the Gulf of Mexico, which forecasters had predicted would impact coastal areas by late Thursday evening into Friday morning (November 14-15).

Rising waters submerged numerous neighborhoods near New Orleans and other towns along bayous as reports came in throughout Tuesday night. Officials warned that the water could stay high for several days, urging residents to be ready or evacuate if necessary (with some areas already being advised of mandatory departures).

"We are looking at possibly life-threatening flooding across a significant portion of Louisiana," said Governor John Bel Edwards in his evening statement. "The magnitude and speed by which these waters have been rising is alarming, but we remain vigilant." His administration has opened several shelters to accommodate residents fleeing the storm's impact (with additional resources being sought from neighboring states).

According to local meteorologists at Louisiana State University, this system was a once-in-a-century event. With wind speeds of up to 105 mph and relentless rain over several days expected, the flood has been described as among the worst on record for parts inland from New Orleans.

"It's not just about immediate response; we have a long recovery ahead," said city engineer Michael Guillory of Baton Rouge to CNNMoney. "With waters this high and fast-moving, there will be infrastructure damage." He estimated repair work would take weeks if not months, while floodwaters recede enough for access (increasingly in areas still under water).

Several roads were closed due to the rising levels of Lake Pontchartrain encroaching upon adjacent neighborhoods and bypasses as Louisiana National Guard troops arrived on standby. Local business owners reported damage, with many restaurants having already been forced to shut their doors after days without electricity or accessibility through main streets (with some estimating hundreds-of-thousands of dollars in losses).

"The water reached the second story balcony; I had never seen so much rain," said one resident who wished not to be named, as they navigated their way back from a shelter. "I'm worried about my home now." Their concerns were echoed by other affected residents and local government officials alike, with emergency management directors reporting that upwards of 50 water rescues had been performed across the area in just one day (with more expected as floodwaters rise).

Experts believe this is only a preview of what to come for Louisiana's future if climate change continues unchecked. Researchers warn these sorts of deluges could become increasingly common during hurricane season, with an estimated 40% increase in frequency expected by the end of the century (according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration projections).

"Climate resilience must be built into our infrastructure plans for Louisiana," says Dr. Alicia Morrison, a leading environmental scientist with Mossy Oak Research Institute in Baton Rouge who has been advising local authorities on flood prevention and response since 2005 (with numerous recommendations already integrated). "This is an
