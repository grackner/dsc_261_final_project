Topic: Business - After-Hours

New York City's Financial District had its most active evening of stock trading since September as market participants celebrated a robust economic forecast with an aggressive buying strategy post-earnings season report on Tuesday night, reports CNNMoney. According to sources within the industry and preliminary data from major exchanges, New York Stock Exchange experienced unprecedented volumes of trading after regular hours as investors took advantage of lower share prices following earnings announcements earlier in the day, leading some analysts to speculate that a market correction might be on its way. 


The unexpected rally across various sectors had both optimists and pessimists abuzz within trading floors from Wall Street's iconic buildings down through SoHo late into Wednesday evening, as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) witnessed over $10 billion in after-hours trades alone. "It has been an extraordinary day with buying surges across multiple sectors," said Chris Johnson, head of trading at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which is one of the largest investment banks that operates as a market maker on Wall Street alongside competitors like JP Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc..

The tech sector seemed particularly resilient as shares for Alphabet Inc., Facebook parent Meta Platforms Incorporated, Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., and Amazon saw gains of 2%, 1.5%, 4.8%, 0.9%, and 3% respectively after they reported earnings earlier in the day on Tuesday afternoon while other sectors followed suit amid strong economic indicators for employment, manufacturing growth, consumer spending, etc., as noted by analysts at JP Morgan Chase & Co..


The unexpected rally was fueled largely due to a report from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. that projected an optimistic outlook on the U.S economy with robust job gains and growth in gross domestic product (GDP). The firm raised its GDP forecast for Q4 2023 through mid-Q1 of next year while noting continued strong momentum, which helped stoke buying sentiment among investors looking to capitalize on lower share prices earlier this week. "We're seeing some positive trends that have been underperforming recently," said Richard Sharp, chief economist at JP Morgan Chase & Co., who added the firm was
