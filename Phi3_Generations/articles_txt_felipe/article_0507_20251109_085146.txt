In a bold initiative aimed at revolutionizing beauty standards in urban areas of India and Bangladesh, international cosmetics giant Estée Lauder has unveiled its new "Unified Beauty" program today on March 15th across multiple cities including Mumbai, Dhaka, Kolkata, and Chittagong. Set to launch by the end of this year with a pilot phase in these bustling metropolises known for their diverse cultural tapestry but also battling high levels of pollution that can affect skin conditions; Estée Lauder seeks not only to uplift individual confidence through personalized skincare routines and makeovers but promises to empower communities by fostering inclusivity in beauty standards.

The "Unified Beauty" program, a comprehensive 12-month pilot project funded with $3 million raised from corporate partnerships focused on sustainability efforts within the cosmetics industry, will cater specifically to women and non-binary individuals over thirty who have felt limited by conventional beauty standards. With offices strategically located in each city selected for its vibrant yet challenging environmental conditions affecting urbanites' daily skin care needs - Mumbai dealing with humidity levels that often reach 70% throughout the year, Dhaka experienthy toxic air quality classified as 'severe,' Kolkata and Chittagong facing distinct monsoon seasons creating variable climatic stressors for residents – Estée Lauder's initiative aims not only at addressing individual skincare needs but also on challenging societal norms.

During the press conference, CEO of Estée Lauder Asia Pacific and Japan Rohan Mistry said that "By focusing our efforts locally we can better understand unique regional concerns while celebrating diverse beauty traditions." The project includes monthly workshops led by certified dermatologists and makeup artists from within the region, who will educate participants on managing their skin health against environmental factors. Moreover, they aim to offer free skincare consultations that align with both local traditional techniques as well as cutting-edge scientific approaches in personalized beauty regimens tailored for every unique facial structure and concern faced by individuals living amidst these urban landscapes.

As the program's launch date draws near, a series of public awareness campaigns will precede its actual implementation to build anticipation among city dwellers eagerly waiting on their shelves. The initiative has already begun attracting interest from skincare enthusiasts and industry experts alike who are looking forward to embracing this holistic approach that marries tradition with science for a more inclusive standard of beauty in South Asia's bustling cities where pollution, humidity levels fluctuate significantly throughout the year.

Rajat Gupta, founder and CEO of Dhaka-based nonprofit organization Empowered Women Now said that he believes programs such as these can help eradicate harmful beauty stereotypes deeply ingrained in society for years to come by creating a safe space where women are valued not just on their physical appearance but also the inner strength they possess.

Within weeks of its launch, Estée Lauder's "Unified Beauty" initiative will commence recruiting volunteers from these urban areas who have faced personal struggles with societal pressure regarding beauty standards and inviting them to participate in monthly workshops held at local community
