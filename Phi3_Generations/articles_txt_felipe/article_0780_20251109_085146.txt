A powerful blizzard swept through New York City yesterday evening, bringing record snowfall and freezing temperatures to commuters across Central Park West from Broadway at Columbus Circle to the Hudson River piers in Manhattan's west side neighborhoods between around 4:0 end time. The National Weather Service has issued a blizzard warning for these areas through tomorrow morning, cautioning residents against all travel and urging people who were unable to get home from work or school not to attempt walking across the city in treacherous conditions.

A local resident reported snowfall rates as high as 24 inches per hour at their location near Times Square; New York City officials warn that wind chill levels will be dangerously cold, with temperatures possibly dropping below zero degrees Fahrenheit and gusty winds exceeding speeds of 30 miles an hour. "This is one for the record books," said Mayor Bill de Blasio as he addressed reporters at a press conference yesterday afternoon to warn New Yorkers about travel risks in blizzard conditions.

"We've never seen this much snowfall before, and we are not prepared right now; it will be dangerous out there on the street," warned NBC News meteorologist Janice Okail during live coverage of the weather event at City Hall Plaza yesterday evening with citywide visibility dropping to zero degrees Fahrenheit. "We need New Yorkers here in this neighborhood, we are going door-to-door right now and asking for people inside not go outside," said a street commissioner from Midtown's Engine Company 51 who helped dispatch volunteers to assist elderly citizens with transportation during the blizzard yesterday evening.

Experts explain that heavy snowfall occurs when cold air masses collide on top of warm ones, creating unstable conditions and leading to rapid accumulation at ground level; meteorologists say this type of severe weather event is not out of season for New York but can happen during the fall or early winter. "We had a similar situation back in 2017 where it snowed as late as November here on Manhattan's west side, so while unusual now that we are into January months without such conditions isn't impossible," said Dr. Emily Rasmussen from The Weather Channel during yesterday evening's live interview; she added the city could experience more of this severe weather before things start to stabilize next weekend when a cold front is expected across New York City and surrounding areas on Saturday morning-afternoon. 

The heavy snowfall has caused significant disruptions in public transportation, with subway services temporarily suspended yesterday evening due to safety concerns for train operators working under such harsh weather conditions; officials say commuters are urged not to rely solely on the New York City Subway system during blizzard emergencies. In addition, thousands of cars have been stranded at various points throughout Manhattan's west side neighborhoods due to road blockages and accidents resulting from slippery conditions; police deployed numerous officers yesterday evening in a bid to maintain safety for all New Yorkers stuck on the roads amid severe weather warnings across Central Park West.
