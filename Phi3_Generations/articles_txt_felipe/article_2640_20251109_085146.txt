A local health official announced a new community fitness initiative aimed at tackling rising obesity rates in New York City on Tuesday, March 5th. Mayor Bill de Blasio revealed plans for the "Fit NYC Challenge," set to launch next month with goals of increasing physical activity among city residents and decreasing average body mass index (BMI) figures within five years.

"We must take urgent action now to create a healthier New York City,” said Mayor de Blasio during his State of the City address at the Empire Room in Union Square last night, adding that “this initiative will help us achieve just that."

The program encourages participation from all age groups and offers various programs catering for different interests. These include free outdoor fitness classes held across 50 city parks, a bike rental scheme to promote active commuting along the Hudson River Greenway, an online portal with resources about nutrition and physical activity tailored specifically to New Yorkers of color who are disproportionately affected by health disparities.

De Blasio’ban staff report showed that obesity rates in NYC have increased from 16% among adults aged 20-49 years old between 2013 and 2017 to nearly 28%. A study released last year by the New York City Department of Health estimated this cost city taxpayers $5.5 billion annually in healthcare expenses related to obesity-related diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, stroke and certain cancers which often require intensive treatment or lifelong medication regimes for management.

“This new program represents our commitment towards providing New Yorkers with opportunities that will help them lead healthier lives,” a spokesperson said in an email statement to CNN Local News Network today, pointing out the comprehensive nature of this initiative which “recognizes and addresses various factors contributing to obesity.”

“The Fit NYC Challenge is not just about diet or exercise – it’s also aimed at providing resources for mental health support," said Health Commissioner Ashwin Schems, speaking today in front of City Hall. "Mental well-being plays a crucial role when adopting lifestyle changes and staying active over the long term."

A representative from New York’s Department of Parks & Recreation confirmed that several new parks facilities will receive upgrades, including modernized fitness equipment in an effort to “make it more attractive for people seeking physical activities while spending time outdoors.” This includes expanding existing workout stations and adding playground areas equipped with exercise-friendly features like see-saws that can also be used as a form of low impact aerobic training.

“The city’s goal is to create an environment where leading healthy lifestyles becomes easier, more accessible and affordable for all,” said NYC Council Member Mark Levine (D/WF), whose district includes many parks which will see enhancements under the FitNYC Challenge. “This initiative has great potential in promoting overall well-being among our diverse population.”

Several local fitness experts have been consulted during planning stages of this new program, all agreeing that "It's about empowerment and education rather than just telling people to lose weight." said Fitness Director Lisa Rodriguez from the Brooklyn Health Club
