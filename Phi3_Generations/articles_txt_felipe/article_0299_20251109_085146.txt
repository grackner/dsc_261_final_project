In today's rapidly evolving media landscape, major tech conglomerate BigMediaGroup has announced a significant pivot in their business strategy amidst growing concerns about market concentration and its impact on competition within the industry. At an annual shareholders meeting last Tuesday evening at the New York Times Building, CEO Elizabeth Grant revealed that starting next quarter, 30% of company's revenue will now come from diversifying into digital advertising markets beyond traditional TV and print mediums.

Grant explained in her speech: "We recognize a new era where media consumption is increasingly shifting to online platforms - it’d be short-sighted not to adapt." BigMediaGroup, known for their dominance on airwaves since the 1980s, has now secured several lucrative contracts with tech giants like Apple and Google. This move follows an industry study released last month showing a steady decline in traditional media revenue streams over the past five years - which experts have linked to increased streaming platform competition among younger generations of audiences.

A senior executive at digital marketing firm MediaVanguard, Robert Hughes remarked on BigMediaGroup's change: "It’s a smart move for them given how consumer behavior is changing." He further emphasized the need by saying that while traditional media still holds substantial influence in many demographics, millennial and Gen Z audiences tend to lean towards digital content.

Market watchers are closely observing this transformation as it could set a precedent for other major outlets struggling with similar challenges within their respective industries amidst ever-changing technology trends influencing media consumption patterns globally.
