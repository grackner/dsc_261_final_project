In a historic turn of events in South Africa's political arena, President Jacob Zuma has announced his intention to resign from office effective immediately following pressure and scandals that have marred his presidency over the past years. The announcement came amid heightened public outcry for transparency as allegations against him continue unabated since 2016 when he first faced serious corruption charges linked to state-owned enterprises.

The news comes just days after Parliament voted on a motion of no confidence, with only three MPs opposing it - all from Zuma's own African National Congress (ANC). This critical vote represents the culmination months of mounting public and political pressure that have led to multiple rallies in Pretoria demanding change.

Speaking at a press conference this evening, President Jacob Zuma stated: "The South African people are ready for new leadership as they no longer wish to endure my failed presidency which has brought corruption and mistrust into our country." He went on adding that his decision will bring hope back home. 

This latest setback follows the unveiling of a damning report by ANC's own auditor general last month, revealing evidence of misuse of government funds during Zuma’tyear as President and detailing an extensive web of corruption involving former finance minister Nhlanhla Nene among others.

The news has sent shockwaves across the political landscape here in South Africa where despite being one of the world's most economically unequal nations, citizens still hold hope for a better future under new leadership—a sentiment that resonates strongly after decades-long apartheid rule. This development comes as Zuma is expected to face trial on charges related to state capture and corruption soon with potential jail time looming large over him; however, he has yet to formally accept the resignation offer made by Deputy President David Mabuza in April 2018 when rumors started circulating about his intentions.

Mmusi Mafe, a local ANC member and witness during Zuma's presidency who testified against him at court hearings recalls how the public was disillusioned: "There seemed to be no end in sight with these corruption allegations when finally this announcement came." She expressed hope for change but also fear of potential retaliation, recalling instances where former allies turned hostile.

As South Africans digest Zuma's decision and await Mabuza’s official response on whether he will accept the resignation or form his own government—likely to follow ANC protocol in choosing a successor from within their ranks—political analyst, Sipho Nkosi remarked: "This is definitely progress towards accountability but it's still early days and we must remain vigilant about those seeking power."

The South African Electoral Commission has confirmed that elections for the next President are due to be held in 2019 with candidates expected from across political lines, potentially offering a fresh start. However, many citizens continue questioning if Zuma's resignation will truly signal an end of his corrupt reign and promise newfound trust among South Africans towards their government institutions.
