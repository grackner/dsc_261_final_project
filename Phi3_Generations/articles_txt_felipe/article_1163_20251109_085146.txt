A powerful blizzard swept through New York City yesterday evening, bringing record snowfalls to areas across Brooklyn and Queens that haven't seen such extreme weather for decades according to the National Weather Service (NWS) in a statement issued this morning by its spokesperson. Over the past 12 hours alone, parts of Midwood experienced over three feet of accumulation while sections of Far Rockaway tallied more than five feet as reported at around noon local time yesterday on March 3rd and continuing through early today's snowstorm watch in effect by NYC Emergency Management.

The sudden blizzard came without much warning, catching many residents off guard who were unprepared for such severe winter conditions with temperatures below freezing expected to last until the weekend as per forecasts from NWS meteorologists specializing in New York's weather patterns at their 24-hour monitoring station. The snow started around six p.m., quickly covering everything within minutes and turning commutes into nightmares, said Mayor Bill de Blasio during his evening press conference calling for emergency services assistance throughout the city while acknowledging that it was a rare occurrence with lasting consequences on daily life and business operations in heavily affected regions: "This storm is exceptional. We are all dealing together as one community."

"I have never seen anything like this since I've been here," said longtime Brooklyn resident Michael Thompson, who spent the evening shoveling his elderly neighbor's driveway after he became stuck himself trying to find help from passersby and volunteer plow drivers. "It's crazy how quickly everything got covered up."

In response to this historic weather event that has already caused major transportation disruptions, NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Friday morning local time an emergency declaration for Queens with the intention of deploying additional resources including more snowplow operators and salt trucks. The city also advised residents in highly affected areas to stay home if possible as public transit was temporarily suspended during peak hours, per NYC Department Of Transportation's official announcement shared at a Sunday morning brief meeting between local officials: "We are doing everything we can but expect this snowfall pattern will continue with similar intensity through tonight. We urge New Yorkers to remain vigilant and take necessary precautions."

As of now, the entirety of Queens has been under an ice storm warning for potential freezing precipitation due to plummeting temperatures forecasted by NWS meteorologists at their local weather station in Jamaica. "We cannot predict precisely how this snowfall pattern will develop further so we must prepare accordingly," said a representative from NYC Emergency Management who wished not to be identified without media training or attribution and emphasized: "This is an extraordinary situation that demands our full attention until the weather subsides."

In addition, some subway services have been temporarily suspended in Queens with MTA officials stating they are working around-the-clock trying keep trains operating amid this historic blizzard while assuring commuters to check transit alerts frequently for updates and safety advice before heading out. As of 6 p.m., there were reports that more than one dozen vehicles had been stranded on local roads including buses, cars, delivery trucks as well as emergency service vehicle crews who continue their relentless efforts to clear snow-covered streets under hazardous conditions throughout the city according to NY
