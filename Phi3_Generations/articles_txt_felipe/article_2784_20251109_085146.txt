On March 15th in downtnerville, a small community just outside of Austin, Texas, five teenagers experienced severe food poisoning symptoms from what was initially thought to be an innocent birthday party treat: homemade cookies made with raw egg yolks. The incident came as no surprise when Dr. Emily Thompson, the local pediatrician and one of the hosts at Mrs. Smith's 16th birthday bash on Saturday evening revealed that some guests had been ill after consuming a dessert she baked herself for her daughter’s special day.

Dr. Thompson informed authorities about six teenagers displaying symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea within hours of the celebration, with four girls aged 14-17 taken to Austin Hospital's Emergency Department by concerned parents last night around 8pm. The raw egg mixture she used had been sitting out for several hours before being served on a platter adorned with festive sprinkles and candied fruit garnishes, which drew attention from her impressionable young guests eager to taste the homemade goodies that were an exotic touch compared to their usual store-bought snacks.

Dr. Michael Harris of Austin Hospital confirmed food poisoning cases in two patients but said most would recover quickly with supportive care as raw eggs are a known, yet preventable culprit behind such outbreaks each year due to the risk of Salmonella contamination. "These kids should be enjoying their time together," Dr. Harris shared regretfully while visiting one patient in isolation yesterday afternoon around 3pm.

Local health officials are urging residents, especially those with children and families celebrating gatherings at home this summer to prioritize food safety practices that have been endorsed by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) since a spate of raw egg-related illnesses was reported in neighboring communities earlier this year. They advise against using uncooked or undercooked eggs, including those found within homemade dishes like mayonnaise and hollandaise sauce, due to the risk for foodborne bacteria transmission leading potentially serious health complications among vulnerable groups such as pregnant women, young children, older adults.

The Texas Department of State Health issued an advisory about a Salmonella Enteritidis outbreak traced back last month from raw egg products at several local grocery stores and cafes across the region; since then five individuals have fallen sick with mild to moderate food poisoning symptoms, three were hospitalized for dehydration.

"I never used raw eggs in my baking before because I didn’t know they could be so dangerous," admitted Mrs. Thompson yesterday while explaining that she had been unaware of the proper handling protocols when preparing her daughter's birthday treat at their family home on 52nd Street earlier this weekend with just over a dozen invited guests and loved ones present to celebrate alongside local friends who arrived carrying small gifts for Mrs. Smith’s sweet sixteen daughter, Katie Johnson.

"I wanted something special that wouldn't usually be found in grocery stores," explained mother Sarah, one of the hosts at the party whose son Michael had been admitted briefly overnight after showing mild food poisoning symptoms this morning around 10am. "It was such a festive moment when we all shared delicious cookies baked with love
