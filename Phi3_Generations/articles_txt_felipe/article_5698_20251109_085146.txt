Researchers at Johns Hopkins University unveiled a new sustainable solution to reduce carbon emissions in urban areas today. The study published this week shows how rooftop gardens could potentially cut down pollution by up to 25% if implemented on a large scale throughout cities like Baltimore and Washington, D.CTA

"The potential impact of these green spaces is tremendous," says lead researcher Dr. Emily Stone as she presents her team's findings at the annual Environmental Science Summit in Maryland this Thursday afternoon. "With just a 25% reduction across major urban areas, we could see significant improvements to air quality and overall environmental health."

The study, conducted over three years on select buildings throughout Baltimore with large rooftop spaces available for conversion into gardens or green roofs shows that not only do these installations provide cleaner air but also promote biodiversity within city environments where natural habitats are scarce. 

Dr. Stone's team has been working closely with local officials, building owners and community groups to identify potential sites in Baltimore for this pilot project which is expected to expand nationwide should further studies confirm the initial results published by her research group today at a press conference on Capitol Hill tomorrow afternoon Washington DCTA

"The rooftop gardening trend has been growing rapidly among homeowners and businesses seeking sustainable ways to cool their buildings while contributing positively towards eco-friendly goals," says Dr. Stone who hopes her team's findings could encourage further government incentives for green roof installations nationwide as a solution against urban air pollution which has been steadily increasing over the past decade according to data from Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Washington DCTA

Brian Thompson, an environmental policy analyst at George Mason University's Center for Climate Change Communication says that with this newfound proof of success in Baltimore and a national push towards greener living is needed. "This study presents us all with evidence that concrete jungles can transform into more sustainable ecosystems," he explains, adding further credence to the importance of rooftop gardens as one solution among many for combating climate change effects in major cities across America DCTA

In response to Dr. Stone's findings and call-to-action today, Mayor Muriel E. Bowser has announced that she plans on expanding green initiatives within the city of Washington DC this spring by encouraging property owners through tax credits for installing rooftop gardens with a targeted reduction goal based upon Dr. Stone's report to reach 15% decrease in urban pollution levels DCTA

"By integrating nature into our living and working spaces, we take one more step towards reshaping modern cities as self-supporting ecosystems," says Bowser during her press conference announcing the tax credit program. The city's Department of Energy & Environment (DOEE) has already begun work on a list of qualifying properties to receive credits by spring DCTA

As part of an increasingly green initiative, Dr. Stone emphasizes that implementing this solution alongside other environmentally friendly practices is crucial for lasting impact in combating climate change nationwide DCTA
