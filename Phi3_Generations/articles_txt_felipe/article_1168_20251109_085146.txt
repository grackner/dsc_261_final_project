In a startling discovery that has sent shockwaves across continents this week, an ancient city believed to have been lost for centuries beneath China's Yangtze River was unearthed in Yibin City on July 29, 2degrees underground. The remarkable find is set to change our understanding of early human civilization and its migration patterns significantly, as archaeologists begin excavating the site believed to be over a thousand years old.

The team, led by world-renowned Chinese archaeologist Dr. Li Hua, stumbled upon this extraordinary urban settlement while exploring new areas along the banks of Yangtze River near Yibin City in Sichuan province after following some peculiar radar signals detected during a routine survey last month. This city predates any previous discoveries by approximately 50 years and offers unparalleled insights into human history, culture, agriculture, trade routes, and possibly even advanced technologies of its era that were previously unknown to researchers outside Asia.

Dr. Li Hua expressed his team's excitement about this monumental discovery: "We are deeply moved by our findings today; it is an archaeological treasure trove we have only dared dream about." However, uncovering the secrets beneath a fast-flowing river comes with challenges and risks. The ongoing excavation demands utmost caution to ensure everyone's safety due to potential geological instabilities in this area of Yibin City near the Yangtze Riverbank—known for sudden shifts caused by underground water movement that occasionally results in landslides or sinkholes.

The government has temporarily halted development along a four-kilometer stretch where artifacts have been unearthed, with authorities stepping up security and support to ensure the safety of archaeologists working on this groundbreaking project funded by both Chinese officials and international research institutions worldwide. An estimated 20 million yuan ($3.25m) has already been allocated for preliminary exploratory work over a six-month period, with additional funds requested to expand the excavation's scope in subsequent stages of investigation when deemed safe by geological and structural experts.

"The discovery beneath Yibin City will reshape our understanding of early civilizations across Asia," stated Zhang Wei, head of national archaeology department at Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS). "It is a unique opportunity to explore human history like never before." This significant find promises extensive studies in various disciplines: anthropology, art history, sociopolitical dynamics during the settlement's prime time period, and even climate research as scientists look deeper into patterns revealed by sediment layers.

A preliminary report released on Tuesday reveals that an ancient city comprising intricately designed homes built with mud-brick walls is intact beneath a two-meter layer of waterlogged soil - preserved for millennia due to the Yangtze's high humidity levels and stable temperature. The settlement houses some 50 structures, including residential areas, marketpops (commercial centers), communal spaces like plazas or courtyards, ceremonial buildings, possibly granaries or storerooms for excess harvests during prosperous seasons - all offering fresh insights into urban planning and social organization in ancient Asia.

The underwater excavation is being conducted by a multidisciplinary team of
