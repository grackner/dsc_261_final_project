In a dramatic turn of events on Tuesday evening in Baghdad's Green Zone near the historic Perfume Festival Square at around 7:30 PM local time, tensions escalated as demonstrators clashed with security forces during heightened protest activity. The unrest erupted over economic grievances and widespsel discontentment towards government policies among other issues. CNN has learned that this confrontation marks a significant upsurge in civilian-police interactions since the start of year, following an increase in public demonstrations against corruption across Iraq's diverse landscape.


Authorities report approximately 30 arrests so far and no casualties as they attempted to contain protesters who have marched on a national scale over economic hardships exacerbated by the region's fragile oil dependency, rising unemployment rates, and corruption allegations within governmental institutions.

They urged Prime Minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi's administration not only address immediate socioeconomic concerns but also implement meaningful reforms and transparency within government agencies to regain public trust.

"If the people are seeking a revival, let it come through dialogue rather than violence," stated Maha Kamal Abbas, leader of an Iraqi civil rights coalition formed earlier this year in response to longstanding grievances among Sunni Arabs and ethnic Kurds feeling sidelined by government policies favoring Shiite-dominated power structures. "It is essential for the future stability of our nation."


Iraq's economy, heavily reliant on its oil sector—which accounts for approximately 95% of state revenues and over two-thirds of GDP in recent years—faces a rocky road ahead as calls grow louder across urban centers demanding diversification into industries such as agriculture, tourism, renewable energy sources, manufacturing.

"Diversifying our economy beyond oil is crucial for Iraq's resilience and sustainability," argued an economist from the Baghd
