In a historic decision for television viewers in New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio has announced that by 2030 all public broadcCTV channels will switch to digital transmission exclusively. This landmark announcement comes amid growing concerns about the sustainability of current broadcasting technologies and efforts worldwide to reduce carbon footprints in media production.

Mayor Bill de Blasio stated at a press conference on Wednesday, "As our city moves forward towards an environmentally-conscious future, we must lead by example." The initiative will be implemented gradually across the five boroughs starting with educational institutions and public access centers in 2023 before moving onto more established areas of the city.

Television historian Dr. Elizabeth Green remarked that "this change represents not just a shift towards green technology, but also signals an evolution for content creators who will have to adapt their delivery methods." Meanwhile, New York City's public broadcCTV station director Mark Johnson expressed confidence in successfully transitioning his staff stating he believes this transformation would ultimately improve overall broadcast quality.

As the switchover progresses over time with full digitalization expected by 2030, city officials have assured that viewers will not experience any disruption to service and are invited to participate actively during public meetings held monthly for further feedback on this significant change in urban media infrastructure.
