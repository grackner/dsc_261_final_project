Jason Smith has led his high school basketball team to an unprecedented winning streak of ten games at Madison High School in Austin, Texas on Tuesday night against the rival Hilltop High School. With this accomplishment, he sets a new record for consecutive wins since freshman year and cements himself as one of the top players nationwide among 14-year-olds.

Smith's relentless pursuit began in his sophomore season last year when Austin native John Doe set an existing school record with nine straight victories, but he failed to replicate that success during this senior campaign for Madison High School. His teammates are inspired by Smith’s determination and skills on the court as they look forward eagerly at Tuesday's match against Hilltop where a win could see them heading into December break without an opponent in sight, should their streak continue unbroken after tonight.

Junior John Doe once said "I wish him all the best and that he can carry on my legacy," acknowledging Jason Smith's potential to become Austin’s next basketball legend while respecting his current success with Madison High School teammates in their hometown community of 50,000 people. Head coach Linda Johnson expressed her pride saying "Smith has shown an exceptional work ethic and leadership qualities that makes him a standout player on our roster."

Basketball expert from the University of Texas Austin said Smith's skill set is rare for his age group stating, “His speed combined with strong defense skills sets him apart as he manages to disrupt opponents effectively”. The school record-holder also believes that "Smith has a good head on his young shoulders and I have no doubt about the kind of impact he’ll make in basketball."

The next Madison High School game is scheduled against Hilltop tomorrow evening, but with their impressive win streak so far this season along history books worldwide where records are being set after every decade by exceptional talents. They hope to cement Smith's legacy before he heads off for college on the Austin campus of University of Texas-Austin in January 2023, as many anticipate his skills will continue carrying him forward into a promising basketball career beyond high school triumphs and recognition at Madison High School.
