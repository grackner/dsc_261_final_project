In a heart-wrenching event unfolded on December 20th in Bangkok, Thailand, authorities discovered five children abocless and malnourished at the age of four to nine years old in an abandoned industrial building near Klongsamany. Authorities are now working tirelessly since Saturday morning when a concerned citizen reported suspicious activity after spotting one child crying on her way home from school, which turned into a broader investigation involving multiple agencies and international NGOs.

According to the Child Protection Division Chief of Thailand's Department of Social Welfare (DWS), officials are currently sheltering all five children at an undisclosed safe house within their country while providing them with immediate medical attention, including emergency surgeries on three young ones who had not been fed for days. "Their conditions were dire when we first arrived but I'm glad to see that they have shown signs of improvement already," said the chief in a somber tone during his interview yesterday morning at DWS headquarters near Klongsamany station, where he described how local workers stumbled upon these children while clearing out rusted metal objects inside the building.

Dr. Aroon Tippawan, head surgeon onsite and one of Thailand's most skilled pediatric doctors said: "We are performing life-threatening procedures such as tube feedings to these kids who have spent months without proper nutrition or clean water." He added that the children would require extensive therapy after their immediate medical issues had been addressed.

The industrial building where they were found is located approximately three kilometers south of Klongsamany on a secluded corner of Phra Aphatsawaram Road, near what locals refer to as 'the old smelter'. The facility was not in operation for years and has often reportedly been used by criminals.

A government spokesperson said today that the local police force had begun an investigation into how these children ended up alone with no supervision or caretaker, despite being school-aged. "We are working on understanding what led to this horrible situation and making sure such events never happen again," he added solemnly during a press conference at Government House today in Bangkok where senior officials from the Ministry of Social Welfare (MSW), Interpol, UNICEF as well as representatives from local NGOs are involved.

A witness who lives near the old smelter told CNN that she had been walking her 8-year-old son to school when they passed by an abandoned factory and heard crying coming from inside it last Saturday morning. "I knew something was off immediately," said Mrs. Suthithiwat, a mother of two young boys herself but not related in any way with the children she encountered that day after hearing their cries for help through her window screen glasses while waiting on the sidewalk to let them pass by when they arrived at school before 9am local time."

Several social workers and NGO representatives have offered support, including UNICEF who is providing funds towards medical expenses as well has setting up a legal team for child protection issues. However, these rescue efforts come amidst the worsening economic crisis in Thailand where thousands of families are struggling to provide basic necessities such as food and shelter after years of political unrest that led many citizens abroad leaving their jobs or businesses behind with little security due to uncertainty around regulations reforms."
