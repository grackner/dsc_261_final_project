Dar es Salaam has become an unexpected hub for renewable energy investment in East Africa as foreign companies pour millions into wind farms and solar panels over the past year according to a report by local media outlets on March 12, 2024. The city, once known primarily as Tanzania'thy heartland of tourism with its pristine beaches along the Indian Ocean coastline has now been thrust into global spotlight for this green energy revolution that is not only transforming local infrastructure but also creating jobs and attracting investment to a region in need.

Investors from across Europe, Asia, and North America are flocking here after Tanzania unveiled its first comprehensive renewable energy policy last year aimed at reducing carbon emissions while stimulating economic growth by providing alternative sources of power for industries that have historically relied on fossil fuels.

The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) has reported over $50 million invested in new wind farms and solar energy projects within Tanzania's borders this year, while a leading economist from the country claims these investments are expected to generate thousands of jobs for locals by 2025.

Accordingly, officials believe that with further support policies being put into place such as tax breaks for green companies and subsidies provided directly towards renewable energy projects like this one in Mwanza; a city located just west of Dar es Salaam near Lake Victoria — the world's second-largest freshwater lake by volume, these investments could become sustainable over time.

The project being led by British firm Global Power Ltd., which specializes in constructing solar farms across Africa is said to produce enough clean energy annually for approximately 10% of the city's population with plans on expanding within coming years when more panels are installed along Lake Tanganyika. A representative from their team shared, "We believe that this project will provide much-needed electricity and create employment opportunities in Tanzania without harming its environment."

Similarly, other countries such as China have also shown interest to invest heavily here after learning how successful global green energy companies like Enel Green Power (based in Italy) are performing well financially from these projects. Experts say Africa’s economic growth could see an increase with this shift towards clean power supply but require more governmental involvement and support if countries aim for a sustainable future through their transition to renewables according to Dr Kipkorir Kimeto, Environment Consultant at the East African Centre of Excellence in Energy Efficiency (EACEEE).

In response, Tanzania's Ministry of Natural Resources recently announced plans on increasing funding for research and development towards clean energy sources with Deputy Minister Samson Mkenda stating during a press conference last week "We hope to see more investors coming into our country as we continue this journey." The government has also been offering incentives such as lower import taxes, expedited permits processes alongside attractive interest rates on loans provided for clean energy projects.

While critics argue that not enough attention is being paid towards maintaining current infrastructure while investing heavily into renewables; local businessman Michael Mwita believes he sees the opportunity in creating an industry from this transformation, "If other sectors are improving and developing their markets with these projects coming along it would be a boom for Tanzania's economy."
