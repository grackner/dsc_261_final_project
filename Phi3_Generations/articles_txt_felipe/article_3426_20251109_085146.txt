"Scientists in a small village near Mount Fuji have reported signs of unusual seismic activity over the past week that has raised concerns about potential volcanic eruptions impacting nearby cities," reports CNN Asia Bureau Chief, Jonathan Smithers. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) confirmed monitoring equipment around Mt. Fuji detected increased gas emissions and slight deformations in its structure as of April 23rd, with a reported increase in earthquake swarms near the mountain since January this year. Experts have not yet provided clear-cut predictions for an imminent eruption; however, they are actively working to closely monitor volcanic activity levels and warn local communities about any potential risks, says Akira Takahashi, a JMA seismologist based in Tokyo who has studied Mount Fuji' extraditions.

The historic Mt. Fuji is approximately 1238 meters tall with the highest peak reaching up to an elevation of almost twice that height at nearly 2674 feet above sea level, making it one of Japan's most revered natural landmarks and a frequent subject for photographers worldwide who come to admire its iconic symmetrical cone-like shape covered in snow. It is located approximately just an hour away from Tokyo via bullet train or two hours by car; thus positioning the Mount Fuji within close proximity of numerous Japanese megacities, including Yokohama and Nagoya -- cities that have faced their share of natural disasters throughout history (e.g., earthquakes in 2018). Although there is no direct correlation between a possible eruption at Mt Fuji to the damage it may cause due to its distance from densely populated areas, local officials are taking precautionary measures nonetheless.

"We understand that any volcanic activity carries inherent risks; hence our decision to elevate safety protocols in preparation for a worst-case scenario," says Hiroshi Sato, mayor of nearby Shizuoka City who has served since 2018 and previously witnessed minor tremors caused by Mt. Fuji's last eruption around this time four years ago (November).

According to geologists based at the University of Tokyo, it is rare for a volcano like Mount Fuji - which has been dormant since 1707 with its previous and only recorded activity being ash explosions in both A.D. 25-30 – to show signs indicative that an eruption might be occurring now but not yet certain enough for authorities or the public at large to sound a definitive alert, cautions Professor Yumi Yamamoto who specializes in volcanology and has spent decades studying Japan's most active stratovolcanoes.

"Evidence of magma movement towards Mt Fuji suggests it could be awakening after thousands of years; however, there is not enough evidence to claim an eruption or predict one with any significant lead time," says Yamamoto who has studied volcanic activity in Japan since the 1970s.
