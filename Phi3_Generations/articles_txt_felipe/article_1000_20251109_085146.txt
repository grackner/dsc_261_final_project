In an unprecedented move aimed at improving public health and safety standards across the country, federal officials announced on Monday a nationwide recall of lettuce contaminated with E. coli O157:H7 bacteria in all major produce markets by Friday. The announcement follows several incidents involving foodborne illnesses linked to romaine lettuce sold at popular grocery chains since October, reports CNN Health.

The recall was initiated after a routine inspection of local farms uncovered evidence suggesting the presence of E. coli O157:H7 bacteria in raw and bagged spinach grown on one specific farm near Watsonville, California. Investigators traced contaminated lettuce back to irrigation water used from nearby fields that had tested positive for wild pigs carrying fecal matter containing harmful strains of the pathogen earlier this fall season (October 2018).

Sarah Thompson, spokesperson for Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said: "The risk to public health is significant. Our top priority right now is preventing further spread by removing contaminated products from the market." Dr. Robert Smithson of UCSF Health noted that this recall could potentially save lives, highlighted in a statement released earlier today on Wednesday as cases continue to rise with five people already hospitalized due to symptoms ranging from mild diarrhea and stomach cramps after eating contaminated food.

The affected products were distributed nationwide but primarily sold at Whole Foods Market, Trader Joe's, Walmart Supercenters, Safeway stores (which include Albertsons), Target, QFC Markets & Publix in Washington state and Florida respectively; as well as local produce stands across California. Officials also noted that products from the same distribution center with a separate farm label are not implicated by this recall but may still be sold at other locations within their area of operation until further notice due to logistical reasons associated with transportation delays caused indirectly through environmental factors such as heavy rainfall leading up last month's harvest season, according to sources who declined to go on the record for fear they could lose their jobs amidst rumors spreading about company misconduct.

Several major brands including Fresh Farmers Co-Op Inc., and Green Leaf Organics had already issued voluntary recalls earlier this month after routine lab testing identified potential contamination within some of the leafy greens they market under their respective private label names, such as "EcoChoice" or organic labels. The California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) is currently investigating how irrigation water can become a breeding ground for pathogens like E. coli O157:H7 due to runoff from nearby fields contaminated by wild animal feces, despite the strict standards set forth in state regulations designed specifically tackle such issues over the past several years following outbreaks of foodborne illness caused primarily by consuming raw leafy greens or unpasteurized juices.

"This is not just an isolated incident," said Tom Gomez, Chief Veterinary Officer for CDFA in a press release yesterday to media outlets nationwide after conducting further tests which revealed the presence of more than 50% bacteria samples with high levels exceeding public safety standards
