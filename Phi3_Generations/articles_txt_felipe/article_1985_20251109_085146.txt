South African soccer star Siya Kolisi was announced as captain of England's World Cup squad on Thursday in a historic first for black leadership within international rugby league and cricket too — but he isn’t the only big name making waves at this year’s tournament. In fact, English footballer Marcus Rashford has also been stealing headlines with his performance on the field as well as off it after scoring 15 goals in just six Serie A matches last season for Manchester United and leading a campaign against child food poverty during lockdown back home (which resulted in £22million of emergency funding from politicians). Here are some more standout performers who have been lighting up their teams:

**Liverpool's Mohamed Salah, 26-year-old Egyptian forward for England — and Manchester City alumni (7 goals in just six Serie A fixtures last season) is currently leading the team that sits atop Group G with a perfect record so far by scoring seven times this World Cup.** His impressive performances have been backed up on the pitch, too; Salah was awarded Player of the Year for African Football Association in 2019 and has won two Golden Boot awards — one last season alone (34 goals total). When he isn't busy racking up goal-after-goal against international competition this summer however...

Salah tells Sky News: "For me, playing soccer is the reason I am here. It helps to keep my mind right and keeps it happy for myself as well."

Watford Coach Aidy Booth says: “He's been an absolute pleasure to have as my assistant coach here. We just had a really good chat about his style of play and how it could complement our tactical approach.” (Booth has spent most of the season leading Watford’s attacking, which boasts over 50 goals in total)...

**England's own James Maddison may not be from across the pond but he's making an impact nonetheless as a Manchester United midfielder (37 league appearances last season for his hometown club and has netted seven Premier League goals since joining in 2016) — which is crucial considering that Maddison was one of the first players to come forward against racist abuse he’s faced on foreign soil.**

In an interview with DailyMail, Maddison said: "I'm trying not to let it bother me but I will be honest and say when you get down there in South America or Europe — that kind of culture is still around.” 

Maddison told the Mail he experienced a racist chant while playing for Chelsea at home against Manchester City last year: "It's really tough to deal with but I
