Topic: Style - Design

As designers continue to reimagine office spaces for post-pandemic efficiency and aesthetics, New York City's famed Art Deco hotel The Majestic is getting an iconic makeover inspired by the city itself - transforming into what could be described as "Style meets Functionality." Slated to unveil its stunning renovation this summer, local interior designer Mariana Cruz has been selected for her bold and innovative approach.

Situated in Midtown Manhattan with an exquisite exterior that reflects the Art Deco charm of a bygone era, The Majestic will not only retain but enhance its unique appeal as it undergoes extensive refurbishments aimed at modernizing workspaces without sacrificing historical beauty. "We wanted to create something timeless yet functional," Cruz said, standing amidst the hotel's ornate lobby surrounded by sketches and fabric swatches for upholsteries inspired by 1920s fashion while discussing her vision with colleagues.

For years, The Majestic has been a testament to New York City’ enduring spirit of transformation - from its original opening in 1927 as the Hotel de la Convention and then closing after several decades due to financial struggles before being reopened under new management in late August last year. With renewed purpose, it aimed not only at becoming a hub for corporate meetings but also an exemplary living space designed with attention to style and sustainability - marrying the old world charm of New York's past architectural trends like Art Deco or Mid-Century Modernism while embracing contemporary minimalist concepts.

The redesign led by Cruz is expected not only to uplift The Majestic’ overall ambiance but also improve environmental sustainability, with plans for energy efficiency and waste reduction throughout the building's processes. "We envisioned a space that reflects both tradition and progress," said Johnathan Kim, hotel manager at The Majestic before the renovation process began in April this year.

To realize her vision, Cruz has collaborated closely with architectural firm Harrison & Sons - known for their work on landmark buildings such as Penn Station revitalization project where they blended classical design elements seamlessly into modern structures while retaining original aesthetics intact within the city’s fabric. As per her plans, The Majestic lobby will be adorned with metallic finishes echoing Art Deco's intricate geometric patterns yet employ sleek lines reflective of minimalist design principles popular today - creating an ambience that speaks volumes about New York City without speaking aloud.

As Cruz navigates the delicate balance between past and present, her work promises to strike a chord with visitors who will not only find themselves enveloped in The Majestic’ rich atmosphere but also experience cutting-edge technology implemented discreetly within its confines: state-of-the-art HVAC systems providing energy efficiency; integrated digital directories replacing traditional ones, and personalized lighting settings controlled by a mobile application that enhances productivity while reducing ecological footprints.

Echoed in her words during an interview with The New York Times last week - "Our approach is not just to restore but also reinvent the spaces we work within; ensuring every aspect of design fosters creativity and engagement, resulting ultimately in a harmonious blend between formality that inspires confidence and
