As athletes from across the globe converge on Paris for the Summer Olympic Games in August, a recent survey has revealed that over two-thirds of American viewers believe their favorite team will triumph during the closing ceremony. Despite no official medal count or final results yet to be announced by International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach ahead of next Wednesday's grand finish line ceremonies at Roland Garros Stadium, enthusiasm runs high among sports fans back home as they cheer on national teams in various sporting events throughout the city and beyond.

In a recent interview with BBC America Sports Director Simon Broomfield, he shared that "there has never been such intense excitement for both Olympic men's basketball games happening simultaneously" at the newly-reconstructed Paris Arena - home to NBA fans since 2014 when they were invited as part of their international goodwill tour. The French Open also draws American tennis aficionados, especially with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal making headlines for drawing competitive matchups in a major Roland Garros tournament just days after participating at the US Open last month; both will look to extend their historic rivalry through this year's Olympic event.

Following on from an intense pre-competition training and media frenzy that has gripped Tokyo since April, athletes face unprecedented pressure when competing at the Olympics - with expectations for medal hauls skyrocketed due to recent record wins by Team USA across multiple sports disciplines overshadowing this summer's events. "It's not just about personal accomplishments anymore; it feels like every athlete carries an immense responsibility on their shoulders," says former US swimmer, Jessica Engebretson who has attended all three of her country’s Olympic finals as a reporter since 2004 (including multiple appearances at the Beijing Olympics).

In France, where fans packed out stands during Euro 2016 and European Championships have been known for their unwavering support over past decades - passionate crowds can often be heard chanting through stadiums in Lyon. While it remains to be seen whether national teams will maintain such fervor at these Olympics after witnesses recall a similar atmosphere prevailing during Paris 2017 when the host nation struggled against fierce competition from Canada's men's hockey team and New Zealand cricketers, leading some supporters towards introspection.

"We need to stop looking for reasons why we lose," says Pierre Dupont who has been following French handball closely over these Games after attending matches at the Parc des Princes since 2015 - one of Paris' iconic sports arenas that hosted Euro and World Cup events previously. "As fans, it is essential to offer encouragement rather than focus on criticism when things don't go our way."

Ahead of Wednesday's climactic finish line ceremonies set for 10:30 PM Paris time (6:30 AM ET) at Roland Garros Stadium - which was built as a tennis facility but has since been reconstructed following damages from floods earlier this year; fans can still feel the ripples of anticipation.
Bach stressed in his own statement released to the press yesterday that "the Olympics are about excellence, friendship and universal peace". He added: “This Olympic Games represents not only athletes’ personal achievements but also a coming together for nations worldwide.” His message reson
