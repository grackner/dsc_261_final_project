As of this week in New York City, a growing number of residents are reporting difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep due to what sleep experts believe is an unrecognized city-wide health crisis – insudeom or poor indoor air quality impacting the population's rest. According to recent polls taken by local researchers from The Sleep Institute, approximately 30% of New York City residents have experienced some form of disturbed sleep within the last month alone; reports range anywhere between mild discomfort and severe insomnia symptoms that impact daily functioning during waking hours.

Lead pollutant sources are not fully established, though initial studies indicate indoor air quality may be linked to common factors such as secondhand smoke from neighbors or nearby construction projects creating constant outdoor noise. "We're just starting our investigation into the matter," explained Dr. Jennifer Thompson of The Sleep Institute on Tuesday, March 3rd.

Dr. Mark Stevenson, an occupational health specialist based in Queens said his office has seen a similar trend: “As part of routine evaluations during sleep assessments we’ve started asking about indoor air quality concerns more frequently,” he added while handing out informational brochures on the subject to some 15-minute line of patients waiting.

The National Sleep Foundation had issued a report in June finding that almost half (46%) American adults reported feeling drowsy daily, but has not yet recognized these latest findings as part of its wider study into sleep and health since it last evaluated the issue back in 2017- when poor indoor air quality was not included. “The National Sleep Foundation takes public health concerns seriously,” a spokesperson for The Institute stated, “but this phenomenon doesn’t fit our current data set.”

According to statistics from NYC's Health Department collected over the past two months (March and April), 20-35% of individuals complaining about sleep disturbances had similar indoor air quality concerns at their homes, which could be caused by factors such as mold growth or an inefficient heating system.

Experts believe that this growing problem may not just impact residents’ wellbeing but also have wider implications for public health and safety due to increased stress levels on caregivers of the elderly or individuals suffering from chronic conditions who often bear a disproportionate burden in maintaining household environments conducive to restful sleep. “We hope that as New Yorkers, we can come together now more than ever,” urged Mayor Bill de Blasio on Thursday evening while announcing the formation of an independent task force which will investigate this issue and work towards improving indoor air quality for all residents across NYC in coming months.

"We're looking into establishing new regulations around ventilation requirements, as well as educating our constituents about how to recognize symptoms like headaches or difficulty breathing that could be attributed directly backed on poorly maintained living conditions,” he added at the press conference held outside City Hall. The Sleep Foundation issued a statement of support for Mayor de Blasio's initiative, reiterating its belief in promoting public health education and awareness as an effective strategy to mitigate this pressing concern facing New Yorkers: “While we continue our own research into the link between sleep disturbances and environmental factors such as noise pollution or light disruptions –
