In a dramatic turn of events during Sunday's Week 5 NFL action in Pittsburgh, Steelers linebacker James Harrison suffered a career-ending injury on the sidelines when he collapsed following an aggressive tackle by Titans defensive back Adrian Shelton. The collision occurred at halftime and has sent shockwaves throughout the football community this afternoon in Tennessee as well as Pittsburgh, where many Steeler fans expressed dismay over their team's treatment of Harrison, whom they viewed with fondness despite his controversial on-field conduct during games.

Harrison was seen being escorted off the field by medical staff and emergency responders shortly after 3pm local time yesterday when he collapsed while sitting motionless in a Steelers jersey alongside teammate Troy Polamalu, who had been visiting Harrison at his home on Saturday evening. Witnesses report that before taking their seats for Sunday's game against the Titans earlier this afternoon, both players participated without incident during warm-ups and regular drills throughout practice sessions leading up to kickoff time in Arbitrage Stadium just past noon with a crowd of 45,00thy watching on television.

But once Harrison tried sitting down as Polamalu left the field after finishing his pregame participation yesterday evening at around six o'clock PM Pittsburgh Time Zone (PT), tragedy struck when he suddenly collapsed onto Troy while still in Steelers gear and lying flat without any apparent cause. Emergency responders were on hand quickly as Titans players rushed over to assist with moving Harrison from the field, leading offensive lineman Derrick Jones described witnessing a scene where medical professionals arrived not long after he noticed Harrison's condition change at 3:07 PM PT yesterday when fans began chanting "Jimmy! Jimmy!" as they saw him on his way out.

"I just want to see my friend back healthy and strong again, but we all know that will take time," Steelers defensive end Dermick Brown told a reporter at the stadium after Harrison's departure yesterday afternoon with tears still evident in his eyes as he left on crutches while watching gameplay unfold from home this morning via television. "We pray and hope for him every day."

Dr. Marissa Patel, director of sports medicine at Highland Hospital near Pittsburgh Medical Center where Harrison was transported after being evaluated by Titans physicians yesterday afternoon upon his arrival on the field with medical staff following a routine tackle drill led down into Steelers locker room area before he emerged back onto Arbitrage Stadium for Sunday's game, shared her thoughts about what exactly happened to Harrison today in an interview just after 3pm local time.

"We are treating the situation as we would treat any traumatic brain injury here at Highland Hospital," Dr. Patel said with a sense of urgency while attending Harrison's bedside surrounded by his family and teammates yesterday afternoon before he was transported to Arbitrage Stadium on stretchers for an evaluation by NFL officials once again today in hopes of returning him soon after Sunday morning assessment results come back indicating progress toward full recovery.

Official statements from both the Steelers and Titans organizations have been released since Harrison's injury with neither side yet commenting about how this unexpected development might impact their upcoming season, but Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto spoke out in support of one another during a televised news conference
