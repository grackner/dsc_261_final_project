In a stunning upset at Wembley Stadium yesterday evening, FC Berlin United's youth soccer team defeated Manchester City Under-19 by two goals to nil during the UEFA Youth League quarterfinal match on March 3rd. The win comes as an unexpected turn of events for FC Berlin who are now moving into their semi-final phase with hopes high but realistic expectations, given they were previously ranked lower than most teams in Europe's youth leagues.

Following the game, a team representative expressed confidence: "Our young players have shown resilience and determination on this pitch tonight—they deserve every bit of celebration," said Marcus Müller, FC Berlin U-19 coach. He also acknowledged some areas where his squad might need improvement if they wish to advance further in the tournament.
