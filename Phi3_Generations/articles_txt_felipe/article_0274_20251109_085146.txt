In a tight and unexpected primary battle for her party's nomination in Virginia, former State Senator Johnathan Edwards has emerged as the frontrunner with a surprising lead of over 20 percentage points against his closest competitors according to exit polls Monday evening. The results come after an intense campaign season that saw nearly half a million votes cast since February when all candidates officially launched their races for governor in Fairfax County.


Edwards, running on promises of education reform and infrastructure improvements, managed to galvanize the base despite initially lagging behind by just 3% against former Secretary of Commerce Susan Clark who is known for her experience dealing with businesses throughout Virginia's diverse economic landscape. As we wait for more detailed figures from countywide absentee ballots that are due today and additional results expected tomorrow, some experts believe Edwards may have benefited immensely during the last days of campaigning when Clark started receiving national media attention overseas on a humanitarian mission in Europe.


"Edwards' ground game has been exceptional," said James Martin, political analyst at Virginia Tech University and frequent commentator for local news stations. "He targeted key demographics effectively that seemed to have the power of swaying undecided voters who were once considered a stronghold for Clark."


A spokesperson from Edwards' campaign issued this statement: "We are proud of our hard-working volunteers across Fairfax County. They listened, and they led us here with determination - proving that grassroots efforts can win in today’s political landscape.” A former Clark aide said her candidate had hoped for better but understood the outcome was out of their hands: "Susan did everything by the book and fought every single battle on behalf of Virginia, yet politics has always been an unpredictable beast. We have to respect John's win."


As Fairfax County officials prepare themselves for a runoff election in May if no candidate secures over 50% support among first-round primary voters and the county watchdog group releases their report on campaign financing discrepancies tomorrow, Virginia politics seems to be bracing itself once again.
