Amid escalating concerns over its increasing military presence in Asia, a new report reveals that as of this weekend, Chinese warships have begun conducting naval exernervies near the contested waters known as the South China Sea more frequently than before last year. This development comes from maritime intelligence reports compiled by international experts based on satellite imagery and ship logs reviewed over several weeks leading up to now in late March 2023.

Reports indicate that Chinese naval vessels, including frigates armed with modern missile systems and destroyers capable of deploying aircraft carriers' air forces, have been conducting more frequent patrols within the disputed waters shared by China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei, and Taiwan. Naval exercises conducted last weekend included live-fire drills with ships from nearby allies such as Singapore and Japan in a demonstration of strength but also mutual cooperation to maintain regional stability amidst geopolitical tensions over maritime boundaries and access rights within the South China Sea (SCS).

"This is not our first choice, nor do we want it this way," said Lieutenant General Zhao Guohua from People's Liberation Army Navy. "However, with changing international situations demanding increased vigilance on sea territories for all concerned countries including us." 

China maintains a territorial claim over almost the entire SCS despite not having an official sovereignty recognized by most of these neighboring nations and global powers based primarily upon historical rights dating back to ancient times. As tensions flare up with increasing US naval deployments nearer China's shores, many experts say that this is likely just a prelude for further escalation if not properly addressed through diplomatic negotiations or agreements between the parties concerned - including efforts from ASEAN countries like Indonesia and Malaysia advocating dialogue-based conflict resolution measures.

"China needs to understand its role in maintaining regional peace while protecting sovereignty claims," said Dr. Susan Blanchard, a US expert on Southeast Asian affairs at the University of Hong Kong's China Institute who closely tracks developments herein and has advised several governments over recent years - including Australia which just conducted joint naval exercises with ASEAN member states last month in an effort to reassure allies about their mutual maritime security interests amidst increasing Chinese assertiveness.

Despite China's reluctance so far, calls from some experts and international observers for restraint over military posturing near disputed water bodies have resonated with various regional nations concerned by the implications of any further escalation herein to potentially destabilize an already volatile situation that has seen numerous incidents in recent years between claimant countries' navies.

"The South China Sea is not just important for shipping lanes or rich fishing grounds, but it also serves as a potential flashpoint for wider regional conflict if left unaddressed," said Professor Daniel Haulman from Yale University who specializes in security studies based on Asia and Pacific affairs - speaking at this weekend's international symposium of maritime experts hosted herein where discussions were held regarding possible pathways forward towards peaceful resolution over the SCS disputes.

As countries watch carefully for further developments ahead, it remains to be seen whether China will heed these calls from ASEAN nations and other concerned parties before things spiral out
