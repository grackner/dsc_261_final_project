FASHION SHOW: Paris Haute Couture House Unveils its Innovative Water-Resistant Fabric in September Planned Launch Event  

PARIS (CNN) - The world of haute couture, renowned for creating pieces that redefine fashion seasons after seasons, has unveiled an innovation set to take the runways by storm. Leading French designer Chloe Dubois announced yesterday her new collection will feature a groundbrethy water-resistant fabric which is expected to cement their reputation as pioneers in sustainable luxury wearables.  

Describing how this revolutionary material came into being, the 50-year veteran designer said: "The inspiration behind our new line was twofold; a desire for more durable materials that would stand up to everyday life and an urgent need for eco-friendly options in fashion. The collaboration with Parisian textile scientists allowed us to blend functionality, style, and sustainability."  

Chloe's collection will debut next month at her flagship boutique on Rue Saint Honoré during a special launch event hosted by the French Fashion Federation (FFF) in recognition of their outstanding contribution towards eco-conscious designing. The designer hopes to make Parisian fashion more practical and sustainable, stating that "we want our clients not only looking chic but also feeling empowered for living a lifestyle with less environmental impact."  

The waterproof material is constructed using recycled polyester fibers treated organically. The process ensures the fabric retains its sheen and color even when wet, providing an ideal solution to outdoor wear without compromising elegance or style points of her avant-garde pieces which typically feature intricate beadwork intertwined with natural elements such as lace and silk flowers - a hallmark trademarked by Chloe Dubois.  

Fashion critics are already speaking excitedly about the debut, anticipating that it will set an unprecedented tone for eco-friendly haute couture in Parisian style where fashion is always at its highest pedestal - and this time around there's a sustainable twist.  
 
The next steps are eager to be followed closely by the international community, with more prominent brands expected to join forces with local French innovators aiming for similar environmentally responsible endeavors in fashion worldwide – as consumers become increasingly aware of their ecological footprint and seek ways to minimize it. 

Quotes from experts reflect this shift towards sustainability:  
"This is a significant step forward, not only because the water-resistant material offers practicality for Parisians who live in an all-weather city but also symbolizes how fashion brands must adapt and adopt eco-friendly practices," stated Dr. Isabelle Dubois, sustainability expert at Sorbonne University's School of Fashion Studies.  
 
Witnesses are equally impressed with the launch event: "I couldn’t believe my eyes when I saw these unique pieces that look effortlessly chic yet practical – it felt like a true evolution in fashion," shared one enthusiastic attendee, Jean-Luc Blanchard.
