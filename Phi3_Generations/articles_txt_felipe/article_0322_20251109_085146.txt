A powerful storm battered Eastern India last night with devastating wind speeds that have led to multiple fatalities and widespstatic damage across Odisha state's capital of Bhubaneswar. The cyclone, which swept in from the Bay of Bengal late Tuesday evening into Wednesday morning local time (UTC+5:30), has left at least 28 dead as it roared through villages and towns along the coastline that are already grappling with an ongoing pandemic.

"We saw our world coming apart before our very eyes," said Ramesh Patel, a resident of Bhubaneswar's outskirts who witnessed the cyclone firsthand in his village near Gopalpur port town at around 9 pm local time when wind speeds hit an estimated maximum of about 140 km/h (87 mph).

The National Disaster Response Force mobilized hundreds more personnel to help with rescue efforts, while the Odisha government declared a state-wide curfew starting Thursday. Many survivors have been moved into relief camps managed by local NGOs and volunteers; however, fear remains as communication lines are still down in some parts of affected areas due to storm damage.

India's Meteorological Department issued cyclone warnings well before the landfall yesterday evening but was criticized for not going public with their advisories sooner—despite evidence suggesting that strong wind patterns were forming early Tuesday morning hours, as noted by an anonymous senior meteorologist working in Bhubaneswar.

"The situation here is grim," stated Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik during a press conference Wednesday afternoon after touring several impacted communities and insisting that his administration would take full responsibility for the disaster management response ahead of state elections later this year, which were postponed by health authorities due to COVID-19 safety concerns.

Emergency services personnel continue working round the clock today while conducting aerial surveys using drones; officials estimate that at least three million dollars worth damage has already been done across Odisha state—which includes Bhubaneswar, Cuttack, and Khurda districts where much of this coastal region is situated.

"We can't let the next disaster become a tragedy," Patnaik said during his Wednesday briefing alongside representatives from India Meteorological Department (IMD), Odisha Disaster Management Authority, and civil society organizations coordinating relief efforts on-the-ground—in partnership with national agencies like Red Cross/Red Crescent Society of India. "Our top priority is saving lives; we are doing everything in our power to help people recover as soon as possible."

A statement issued by IMD Chief Jayakrishnan Padmanaban yesterday afternoon reiterated that strong winds from the cyclone could potentially reach speeds exceeding 204 km/h (127 mph) within portions of Odissa coastline, urging affected residents to avoid nonessential travel until conditions improve. Official warnings will be extended further out into sea routes if required by continuously evolving weather patterns that are likely tied not only towards a second storm making landfall later this week but also toward increasingly erratic and extreme climatic behavior due largely within recent years attributed primarily on climate change impacts—a claim supported widely among scientists nationwide as well as globally.
