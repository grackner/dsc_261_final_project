A luxury hotel in Maldives has come under fire for allegedly mistreating guests following a series of complaints filed by concerned patrons during their stay from May to July last year at the Majestic Ocean Resort (MOR). Several high-profile individuals, including celebrities and business executives who were regulars at MOR on weekends or family vacations shared stories about what they experienced.

"We noticed that rooms seemed unkempt despite our frequent requests for cleaning," said Alexandra Williams, a first-time guest whose husband is a well-known Hollywood actor. "It wasn't just one incident but several instances where staff ignored our pleas to rectify the situation."

The Majestic Ocean Resort holds over 300 rooms and resort guests are typically guaranteed luxurious accommodations with personalized service in paradise like the Maldives – known for its pristine beaches, exotic wildlife encounters (e.g., whale sharks), vibrant coral reefs dive spots; where tourists often seek relaxation and indulgence amidst warm tropical breezes during their island escapades in the peak season from December to April when Maldives experiences over half a million international arrivals each month.

Eyewitnesses recounted situations involving unresponsive staff, neglecting guests' special requests for room service or amenities (e.g., extra pillows), and an apparent lack of concern towards ensuring top-notch quality experience – despite having been a popular resort brand in the Maldives since 2016 with over $5 million invested into renovating rooms, facilities, staff training programs; which aimed to provide luxury services along with environmentally friendly practices.

The guest relations manager of Majestic Ocean Resort (MOR), Sarah Connor admitted there have been service issues within MOR but emphasized the resort's strong commitment towards improving customer satisfaction: "We take all feedback seriously and continuously strive to enhance our guests' experiences at MOR. We are aware that some incidents occurred, which were highly disappointing for both us as well as them."

"As a guest-centered organization, we apologize sincerely for these unfortunate situations faced by several of you and will address this matter immediately," Connor added on Thursday at the resort's annual general meeting. "MOR prides itself in providing guests with memorable holiday experiences; as such, maintaining our service standards should always remain a priority."

The hotel management assured immediate actions to review their housekeeping schedules and cleanliness protocol would be undertaken along with revisiting staff training programs that prioritize guest interactions. Additionally, Maldivian Tourism Industry Association (MTIA) representatives emphasized the importance of ensuring tourists' experiences remain outstanding in a market-leading destination like the Maldives and urged resorts to maintain their dedication towards excellence: "We must act promptly as we understand this issue impacted many guests who chose our country for unforgettable vacations."

In response, hotel management pledged not only improved service standards but also promised a comprehensive reassessment of MOR's customer relationship policies and internal communication channels. Guests affected by the incident were offered partial refunds as well as complimentary dining experiences in an effort to make amends for their negative experience at Majestic Ocean Resort during peak season last
