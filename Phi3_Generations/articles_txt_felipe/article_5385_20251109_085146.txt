Astronomers in California have spotted what appears to be a never-before-seen asteroid hurtling towards Earth on Tuesday night. The celestial object was first observed by amateur astronomer John Doe, who noticed the unfamiliar speck of light moving unusually fast across the sky near Los Angeles around 10:32 PM local time as reported in a release from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) on Wednesday.


The potential newcomer to our asteroid family, designated "Asteroid X," was initially estimated by JPL astronomers at approximately one kilometer in diameter – large enough to cause significant damage if it were to impact the Earth's surface with a force exceeding 20 kilotons. Observations so far indicate that Asteroid X is on an unpredictable trajectory, deviating from conventional patterns of known near-Earth objects (NEOs).


"This discovery was quite serendipitous," said Dr. Jane Smithson, a researcher with JPL's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies who assisted in the identification process using radar and telescopic data from nearby observatories. "Finding something new like this is always exciting; it shows how much we have yet to learn about our own solar system."


Experts estimate that Asteroid X could pose no immediate danger, with a safe window of several months for further observation and analysis before making an impact prediction more accurate. But the unusual behavior prompted concerns among some scientists who are considering expanding their tracking efforts to better understand this object's dynamics within our solar system.


The astronomer community is eagerly awaiting additional sightings overnight as they work together with NASA officials, hoping that further observations will provide insight into Asteroid X's orbit and velocity changes which could influence any potential risk assessment for the planet Earth in months to come.
