DALLAS (CNN) -- In a dramatic turn of events this weekend, the Dallas FC soccer team made headlines in their own right as they secured an unexpected victory against perennial powerhouse LA Galaxy. The match took place at Southern Methodist University's iconic stadium on Saturday night with a scoreline that stunned fans and experts alike: 2-1, Dallas FC triumphant.

This unlikely win for the underdogs has sparked an outpouring of enthusiasm throughout their city as they become one step closer to qualifying for this year's MLS Cup Tournament on November 6th in Los Angeles. The match witnessed a gritty fight from both sides, but Dallas FC seemed particularly resilient under the guidance of Coach Thomas Richardson and defensive stalwart Carlos Sanchez as he successfully kept LA Galaxy scorers off balance throughout the second half.

"I couldn't be prouder," said an ecstatic President John Thompson to reporters after his team emerged victorious, "My boys worked tirelessly in training and I believe we saw that determination on display today." In fact, Dallas FC has been working exceptionally hard with their off-season focus being a concerted effort towards strengthening the midfield.

Dallas Galaxy's standout player for the night was striker Daniel Perez who scored both of his team's goals – one in each half - securing him MVP honors throughout game and season thus far with 10 total strikes this year alone, according to ESPN. The crowd erupted into cheers as he netted the first goal on an assist from forward Michael Gomez just minutes after kick-off in a match that had fans breathlessly watching every minute of playtime despite its lengthy duration at 90+2'.

"We knew going into this game how important it was for us to come back fighting even stronger if we wanted any shot at glory," added Head Coach Thomas Richardson about his squad's motivation throughout the match, citing Dallas FC’s recent string of close losses as a driving force. “This win is proof that with hard work and belief in our abilities - no team can ever stop us."

CNN Sports Center reports experts view this victory against LA Galaxy as an important psychological boost for the underdogs ahead of MLS Cup Tournament qualification match on November 6th. Both teams will be eager to carry forward momentum from Dallas FC's unexpected triumph into their next face-off, set at CenturyLink Field in Seattle tomorrow afternoon during Week 17 regulation time before playoffs begin as early as December first based upon regular season standings - a date that has been fast approaching since pre-season began.

In an afterthought about the Dallas FC victory and what it means for their team, former player turned sports analyst Dave Collins comments: "It's not often you see such raw talent come together with proper leadership like this -- they are definitely on my top five pick for most improbable turnaround teams in MLS."

As fans across Dallas celebrate the unexpected win of one local soccer team, there is a sense that anything could happen before next season begins. Still reeling from their victory over LA Galaxy, Coach Richardson and his players are confident going forward but mindful never to underestimate any opponent in sight: "We just keep pushing," he says simply as Dallas FC gears
