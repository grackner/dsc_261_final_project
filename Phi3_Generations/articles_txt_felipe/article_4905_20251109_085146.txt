EAGLE RIVER HOSTS UNBELIEVABLE BASEBALL CATCH BY FIFTH-YEAR STUDENT JAMES LEVINE TODAY AT ECHO POOL MANAGEMENT INSTITUTE, MAINE: The baseball field was abuzz today as the fifth graders at Echo Pool Management Institute in Maine demonstrated their skill and sportsmenership. During a routine practice match between two of the school's best teams, James Levine, an 11-year-old student playing shortstop, executed what some are calling 'the most incredible catch ever witnessed on these fields'.

The event occurred during Echo Pool Management Institute’s annual baseball tournament at their home field in Ellsworth. The fifth graders had been practicing for weeks leading up to the competition which starts tomorrow afternoon and will run through Sunday, with over 50 teams participating across New England. Levine, known for his impressive batting average of .429 last season as a member of Echo’s varsity team, has never before garnered attention outside of baseball circles until today's spectacle.

“I don’t know how he did it,” coach Timothy Richardson said after the game when asked about Levine’s outstanding play during an interview at halftime with reporters present for a live score update on ESPN12 News Network, Maine local station WGAN-TV. “He saw that ball come sailing in from left field and just went full ninja mode – he made the catch cleanly right there.”

The pitcher had thrown several fastballs at high speeds earlier during warm-up exercises before today’s game, but Levine stood his ground on defense. It was a routine fly ball which ended up being an extraordinary one as it seemed to defy physics with its unexpected drop just meters above the diamond after seemingly sailing from right field towards home plate at speeds exceeding 90 mph when James caught sight of it and swiftly moved his body like lightning.

“I’ve been playing baseball for years, but I can honestly say this was one catch that will be etched in my memory forever,” Levine said as he held the ball tightly while teammates congratulated him back on defense afterward during a break between innings at halftime. “I just reacted instantly and didn’t even think about it consciously.”

The catch came from third baseman Jackson Martinez, who threw off his base to make the out while standing right next to Levine as he made an impressive diving stop before finally getting on top of him. This act ensured no one else could possibly snag that errant ball and ended up being part of a record-setting play by all involved in which Jackson helped save what looked like certain disaster for his teammates after the catch was first made under challenging circumstances while simultaneously making it possible to secure another out.

“I’ve seen some great plays over my time playing baseball, but James's act today took me back when I played as a kid,” said retired professional shortstop turned coach John Carmine on ESPN12 News Network during his analysis of the play in between innings after Levine was interviewed about it later that night. “It takes an unbelievable combination of skill, instinct and timing to execute such feats.”
