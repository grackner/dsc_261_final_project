A rare and dangerous strain of Ebola has been detected in a small rural village in West Africa's Democratic Republic of Congo as health workers struggle to contain its spread amid regional unrest. The deadliest ever recorded case, identified on Tuesday by the World Health Organization (WHO), is said to have infected at least 10 people since last month and has raised alarm among neighboring countries.

The outbreak was first reported in Kivu Province near Rwanda's border with Uganda when a local health worker noticed symptoms consistent with Ebola, including unexplained bleeding from the eyes of an elderly man named Jean-Claude Nkudi. "I knew then we had to act quickly," said Dr. Lina Tshemebiya, who is leading efforts on the ground and working closely with aid organizations like Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders) as she coordinates an emergency response team in a tent near Nkudi's home village of Masisi.

According to WHO officials, this strain appears more virulent than previous ones; it has shown resistance against some experimental treatments and is notoriously hard to diagnose due to mild initial symptoms like fever or headache that can easily be mistaken for malaria - a common illness in the region.

Dr. Tshemebiya, who comes from one of Kivu Province'ran most affected communities near Lake Kivu – where locals are also recovering after years of conflict and political instability – has been working tirelessly since she heard news about Jean-Claude Nkudi last month while on vacation with her family in Kinshasa, the nation’s capital.

"We have to be careful not only because this is an Ebola outbreak but also due to violence and food shortages caused by unrest," Dr. Tshemebiya said over a satellite phone as she continued planning interventions while traveling between her clinic in Kivu's Masisi district, Kinshasa city hospitals where patients are being transferred for care after arriving at the frontline and setting up treatment centers near local villages.

Local chief Jean-Pierre Bizumungu knows well how quickly misinformation can spread when his community is not fully aware of an outbreak such as this one, which he thinks may have been introduced by miners from Burundi who came into contact with infected bats and subsequently entered the village without proper screening. "I've seen firsthand people panic-buying things like bleach or disinfectants thinking it’s an impending war; sometimes even refusing to leave their homes out of fear," Chief Bizumungu told a team from Dr. Tshemebiya's aid organization while he sat in the shadowy silence that seems typical for this part of his community where many are struggling with poverty and limited access to healthcare facilities, let alone clean water or sanitation services which only became available during last year’s rainy season following years-long neglect after a devastating conflict left thousands homeless.

Experts believe that the Ebola virus may have been lurking in bats for many decades undetected before this outbreak because they live much farther away than humans do and typically don't interact with them, although there are some cases where meat products such as palm wine might carry traces of bat saliva or blood
