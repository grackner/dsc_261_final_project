Amid escalating tensions between major world powers, a Chinese military exercise was conducted near Taiwan on Monday with significant naval deployments and live-fire drills designed to demonstrate Beijing's resolve in the region while avoiding full-scale conflict. Nearly three dozen ships from China’CTF 120th escorted flotilla trailed along its coastline, as reported by CNN close to Taiwan on Monday morning under unusually clear skies but not directly challenging or threatening any activity beyond a routine show of force in the South China Sea. The display comes after heightened diplomatic and military communications between Beijing and Taipei over recent months that has caused concern among regional allies, particularly following comments last week from Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen calling for continued resistance against Chinese threats to unify with the mainland by force if necessary. Military strategists have closely watched these events as they could signify a shift in Sino-Taiwan relations and pose questions regarding stability on both sides of the strait where decades worths' history is punctuated through waves of armed confrontations yet not fully resolved diplomatically or militarily, with no direct conflict engagement between their forces since 1949. In an interview Monday afternoon by local media outlet Focus Taiwan News Channel interviewer Lin Xiu-hua asked Tsai to clarify her recent statements: "Do you think these military exercises could be interpreted as provocation?" The president responded, saying they should not have been surprised at such a display. After all this is part of China's routine but also reminding us that freedom isn’t given; it must be defended.” Defence officials from both sides stressed their commitment to dialogue despite tensions and reaffirmed pledges made in joint statements last year during Ma Ying-jeou administration, saying they will not resort to force but seek a peaceful resolution of issues including sovereignty. However experts are watching closely for any change as China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with his counterpart from Taipei yesterday under increased pressure while Taiwanese defence chief Benny Chiang told Reuters that he believed Beijing had decided to escalate their military posture near the island in recent months but it was still unclear whether this latest show of force represented a new phase. According to China's Ministry of National Defense, around 100 naval ships and submarines participated along with hundreds more smaller craft including fast attack boats used for rapid assault manoeuvres against possible threats from within the strait as well – an extensive deployment signaling its resolve not only towards maintain but also to project power in a region where it has significant strategic interests even if without immediate intentions toward armed conflict, although some analysts caution that actions often speak louder than words when discussing relations between Beijing and Taipei. 

The exercises are seen by some as an attempt to strengthen internal security amid the political unrest within Taiwan while others view it more so a warning sign of deteriorating ties with its powerful neighbor across the strait despite continued calls for restraint from international mediators including U.S., Japan, and ASEAN nations; all emphasized on their commitment to peace in Asia-Pacific region without directly commenting or interfering in this aspect of Sino-Taiwanese relations though have been engaged in back channel communications regarding cross-strait stability with both sides.
