Sleepless in America: New Study Reveals Surprising Link Between Poor Sleep and Increased Risk of Obesity and Diabetes [Updated]

A groundbreinfluentialstudy published by the American Heart Association (AHA) last week linked poor sleep to increased riskof obesityand diabetes.Researchers from Boston University found that individuals who slept less than six hoursper night were three times more likelyto developtype 2diabetes and twice as likely to become overweight orobese, reports CNN Health Newsdesk Staff on Friday March 27th.
"Our findings suggest poor sleep is not only a risk factor for obesity but can also lead directly to the development of diabetes," said study author Dr Elizabeth Banks in Boston University School Medicine and Harvard Medical School as per an article published by CNN Health News on Wednesday March 25th.
The link between lack of sleep, weight gainand subsequentlydiabeteshas been well-established previously through several studies; howeverthis is the first to examine this risk among young adults aged 20 to 40 years old in a longitudinal study across two decades (1986–2006), accordingto Banks.
Using data from more than 1,300 participants recruited through Boston's public hospitals and community health centers during the initial survey period at age 20-45 years old in 1986 that provided demographic information as well as self-reported sleep patterns (less or equal to six hours per night), researchers followed them up for nearly two decades.
Individuals with poorer quality and shorter durations ofsleep(six hours or less) were found more likelyto develop obesity, diabetesand also heart disease, CNN Health News reported Wednesday March 25th as wellas Boston University School Medicine report on Thursday March 31st.
Banks noted that while previous studies showed this link among elderly and middle-aged adults, it is newfound knowledge for the younger age groups; which are more likely to be engaged in work or schooling fulltime often leading them with less sleep duration of six hours per nightor even shorter durations due to early start times.
According to data from the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), nearly a third(31%)of US adults reported getting seven hours or fewer of sleep on average daily in 2015; while adolescents aged 18–24 years are more likelyto have trouble falling asleep, often because they're using electronic devices before bedtime.
Researchers say their findings highlight the importance for younger adults to prioritize sleep and maintain a regularsleep schedule rather than skimping on it due its link with poor physicaland mental health outcomes; Dr Banks stated that "while we may feel like slackinour hours,theconsequences of such choices can be severe."
Dr. Michael Osborne from the University of Sydney's School Of Medicine who specializes in sleep research told CNN Health News this week his study aligns with what he has found: a direct relationship between poor quality and quantityofsleepand obesity; noting that "it is crucial to identify people at risk, early on before they develop these health conditions."
