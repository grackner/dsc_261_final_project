In an impressive upset during last night's soccer match in Buenos Aires, FC Barcelona suffered a shocking defeat against Segunda División side Deportivo Alaves. The historic encounter on March 15th at the Estadio Municipal de Ipurua saw over 30,00seliant spectators witness what many are calling 'the upset of the season'.

Fresh off their European triumph and with an undefeated record for several weeks, FC Barcelona entered this game looking to continue its winning streak. However, amidst a thrilling first half filled with dribbles, headers, and close-knit defense work by both teams' coaches Eduardo Berizzo and Luis Enrique respectively; the Alaves players managed something no one saw coming — they beat Barcelona 2-1 in extra time following an equalizer at full time.

Ana Rodriguez from Deportivo said, "We knew we had a tough game against top-tier team but with immense hard work and belief that everyone here put forth on the field tonight...we felt it was our night." Local fans echoed Ana's sentiments as they erupted in celebration upon hearing their team clinched an unlikely victory.

"It certainly came out of nowhere, this win over Barcelona," said Berizzo after his side lost for the first time since 1972 to Alaves on March 15th at Estadio Municipal de Ipurua; he pinned part of the blame squarely on referee Daniel Ramirez who "felt there was controversy and did not see it". The match went into a penalty shootout after extra time ended in a scoreless draw.

The Alaves players displayed excellent teamwork, with Carlos Rodriguez's header being the only goal of his career following up on that crucial assist from Jorge Soto just before halftime; he was visibly proud afterwards saying "That helped us keep going". Despite Barcelona’s technical superiority throughout 90 minutes and into extra time as well, they could not maintain their lead against Alaves' relentless pressure.

This unpredictable outcome has caused a ripple of excitement across the soccer world — with experts like former Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez commenting that "this upset should remind all clubs to never underestimate any opponent". 

The next Serie A fixture sees Barcelona hosting Real Madrid. This match, scheduled for April 1st at Santiago Bernabeu Stadium in Madrid is eagerly awaited with eyes not just on the game itself but also this unexpected turn of events that has soccer fans rethinking their expectations and predictions around some teams' performances going forward into the season.
