Democratic primaries in Georgia witnessed a record turnout as voters head to the polls early Tuesday with President Joe Biden's campaign making strategic gains across key battleground districts according to recent projections from CNN and The Hill on April 2, marking an intense contest ahead of Super Tuesday.

"The Democratic primary has been one heck of a ride," said local Democrat Jane Doe after casting her vote in Cobb County early this morning. "I just hope all these votes will count."

Early voting numbers suggest over 150,00sel voters have flocked to the polls across Georgia's key swing districts such as DeKalb and Fulton, setting new records for turnout ahead of a crucial runoff. The high engagement is expected to continue through April 7th when voting closes nationwide following Super Tuesday where Biden faces multiple contenders in primaries across the U.S., according to local election officials cited by CNN and Politico on March 29, well ahead of his eventual November presidential run.

"This energy around early voting is unprecedented," said Fulton County Supervisor Mary Smith during a visit at one polling station in Atlanta Tuesday morning, noting the importance for Democrats to rally their base before casting ballots in Republican-leaning districts like those holding runoffs.

With President Biden and Vice President Mike Pence campaigning across key states this weekend including Georgia where both sides vie for crucial delegates ahead of nominating conventions, The Hill reported on Tuesday that Democrats appeared to gain ground amidst competitive races in traditionally Republican-leaning areas.

In the first wave early voting numbers from Atlanta and surrounding counties have shown a tight race with Joe Biden leading former Vice President Mike Pence by around 10,500 votes out of more than half a million cast while independents John Doe has surged in popularity among voters wary of both major party candidates.

Election officials from Fulton County confirm that all mail-in ballots were counted alongside early voting and vote totals would be updated by the end of day Wednesday, according to a spokesperson for Superior Polling Place located at City Hall in Atlanta as quoted on Tuesday.

Democratic strategist Alex Green expressed optimism about his candidate's support among younger voters while acknowledging that Republican contenders remained strongest within traditionally Democratic-leaning districts, reflective of a national trend noted by NBC News earlier this month which cited polling suggesting Republicans had the advantage in most competitive seats across 14 battleground states.

The election is widely seen as pivotal for Democrats to secure their party nominee and rally behind candidate Biden against a unified Republican Party, especially with many GOP primary elections already concluded while President Trump still maintains high public profile even after his defeat in the 2020 presidential race.

"This early voting surge is just one step toward an energized campaign season ahead," said Jane Doe who plans to turn out again come November despite initial concerns over her vote being counted, following similar sentiments voiced by numerous witnesses nationwide at local polling stations across 15 states and districts as per reports in The New York Times on Friday.
