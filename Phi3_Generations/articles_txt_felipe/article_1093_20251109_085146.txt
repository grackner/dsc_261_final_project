In an unprecedented move that intertwines art with activism in a bold statement against modern consumer culture, thousands gathered at Times Square on Saturday to witness one of history's most impactful public installations: "The Last Supper." Comprising precisely four original Raphael paintings dating back from the 16th century and meticulously recreated by renowned artists Emily Carroll and James McBride, this spectacner took residence in New York City's heartland for a limited run.

"The Last Supper," scheduled to be on display at The Metropolitan Museum of Art from February 1st through June 30th before embarking on international tours as part of its permanent exhibition collection, was an instant visual and cultural sensation since the opening night in October last year when critics began hailing it a masterpiece.

As visitors flocked to Times Square this weekend for what has become a modern-day pilgrimage site for art aficionados worldwide, Mayor Bill de Blasio reminded them that "art serves as the catalyst in society's evolution." He also expressed his pride and appreciation: "I couldn't be prouder of New York City artists Emily Carroll and James McBride bringing this beautiful reinterpretation to Times Square," he added.

Critics have already lauded the installation, calling it an extraordinary fusion between classical artwork and contemporary issues like capitalism that transcends mere imitation or reproduction of historical pieces—an experience they describe as awe-inspiring for anyone who views this stunning display firsthand in its original setting.

Experts on Renaissance Art explain how Carroll's fresh yet faithful approach to Raphael’s iconic work has been carefully curated through extensive research and analysis of historical context, style elements that characterize his pieces during the High Renaissance period: "The Last Supper by Emily captures all its intricacies—the composition, lighting effects on each apostle's face showing emotions ranging from guilt to betrayal. There is something profoundly human about observing this scene," says Dr. Lisa Thompson, professor of Art History at NYU:

One artist said he saw his role in the installation as both preserving and reinvigorating these paintings for new generations — "to showcase Raphael's timeless messages through a contemporary lens while making sure they remain accessible to everyone." A 20-year-old art student added: “I was moved by how beautifully she managed to merge history with modern sensibilities. As someone who grew up watching these paintings, seeing them come alive here in New York City made me realize that my city holds the world’s culture within its heart.”

Visitors are encouraged not just as onlookers but also collaborators—through interactive stations where guests can add their personal touch to create a collective interpretation of "The Last Supper." A spokesperson for Carroll and McBride emphasized this point: “We want people to feel connected; it's essential that everyone has an opportunity not only as viewers but also contributors.”

Looking towards the future, The Metropolitan Museum of Art hopes these immersive exhibitions will prompt global discussions about artistic expression across time and cultures while encouraging dialogue on pressing social issues through various forms such as performance arts: "It's our aim for 'The Last Supper'" says sp
