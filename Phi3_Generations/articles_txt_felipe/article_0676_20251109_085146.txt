In a dramatic turn of events at Dodger Stadium last night, rookie pitcher Michael Torres was struck in the chest by what appears to be batting glove debris during his second MLB Spring Training game on March 15th against rival team Las Vegas. The incident came as a surprise when witnesses report that after making contact with bat three, not only did he continue pitching but managed an impressive performance until being pulled in the sixth inning by Manager Jimenez Garcia.


"When I saw him come out of the dugout, blood was trickling down his chest and arm," a witness named Sarah Mendez told reporters outside the stadium shortly after the game ended at 7:30 PM PDT in Los Angeles, CA. "He looked more like he'd been hit by lightning than struck on purpose."


The team physician examined Torres immediately following his ejection and found no fractures but diagnosed a contusion deep within the chest wall muscle known as the Pectoralis major. Despite being advised to rest, Torres insisted he was fit enough for practice afterward because of previous experience dealing with injuries in baseball's minor leagues back home in Miami, FL.


"Baseball is not a gentle game and sometimes you get thrown around more than intended," said former player-turned-coach Ricardo Sanchez as he watched the incident unfold on camera during Torres’ appearance at an adjacent practice session for Las Vegas' minor league team which took place posthaste. "Miguel just wanted to prove himself, that stubborn competitive spirit of a Cuban American."


As this season kicks off and young talents like Miguel aim high in Spring Training games leading up to their first official major league seasons next year at the tender age of 20-something years old – all eyes will be on Torres’ recovery. His agent, Jonathan Rivera reminded fans that baseball is a marathon not a sprint and reiterated his client's dedication: "Miguel has always been one to stand out in the face of adversity."


With training staff monitoring him closely as he begins physical therapy tomorrow morning, Torres’ return timeline remains uncertain but fans are hopeful that their team hero can come back swinging. The Dodgers' management is yet unsurprised by his grit: "We always expected the best from Miguel," Manager Jimenez Garcia stated confidently before last night's game concluded with Las Vegas winning 4-2 in a nailbiter of an encounter that now includes more than just baseball history.
