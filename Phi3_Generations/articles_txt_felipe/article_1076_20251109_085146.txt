Topic: Health - Sleep

As of Monday morning, a groundbredependent study from Stanford University found that individuals who consistently sleep for at least seven hours report better overall mental health and lower risk factors associated with chronic diseases compared to those who do not get enough rest. The research highlighted the critical role that adequate nightly slumber plays in maintaining a high quality of life, according to Dr. Emily Thompson, lead author of the study published this month.

Thompson's team conducted extensive surveys and analyses involving over 10,000 adult participants from various socioeconomic backgrounds nationwide between April and July last year as part of their investigation into how sleep affects health in America today. The researchers concluded that those who regularly slept for seven or more hours had significantly better cognitive performance, lower rates of heart disease risk factors like high blood pressure and cholesterol levels, along with decreased occurrences of obesity-related illnesses when compared to individuals sleeping less than six hours on average.

"Our study demonstrates just how crucial a good night's rest is for our bodies," said Thompson in an interview last week about her team’s findings which were initially presented at the annual American Sleep Medicine Association conference held by Stanford University this past fall, adding that "it can even affect mental health outcomes as well."

Jason Lee, a 36-year-old IT consultant from Dallas who participated in the study told CNN how he began tracking his sleep patterns after reading about its potential benefits on an industry blog. For several weeks prior to being selected for inclusion into this research project led by Dr. Thompson’s team at Stanford University; Lee monitored and recorded every waking moment, including naps that happened during late afternoons when working from home became the norm due to COVID-19 restrictions last year:

"I started noticing a significant improvement in my mood swings since I began paying closer attention to how long it took me before falling asleep and waking up," he shared about his experience. He also commented on an interesting correlation between sleep deprivation, anxiety attacks that used to happen twice weekly but now have subsided completely after establishing healthier bedtime habits based upon the advice provided by Thompson's study:

"After following some of the recommended practices such as keeping a consistent wake-up time and avoidance from electronic devices before sleep, I felt less anxious about my finances," Lee explained while praising Dr. Emily Thompson’s work on this significant public health issue for American adults over 25 years old that directly impacts every aspect of life quality including physical fitness levels due to its influence in muscle recovery and energy expenditure post exercise routines:

Thompson's findings have since prompted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Rochelle Walensky announced new guidelines last week recommending Americans aim for a minimum seven-hour nightly sleep as part of broader public health strategies to promote wellbeing. "This research is yet another piece in the puzzle that demonstrates just how important getting enough restorative, high quality sleep is not only necessary but imperative," said Dr. Walensky during her statement on Friday at an American Heart Association conference about these new and encouraging recommendations to follow based upon this latest evidence-based work by Thompson's team:

Walensky added that while it can be
