A cargo ship carrying perishable goods has been hijacked off the coast of Somalia on March 12th. The MV Fortune-owned vessel was reported missing at approximately 8:0in morning hours, roughly halfway through its voyage from Oman to Yemen via a common shipping route known as the Arabian Sea Lanes. Authorities have not received any communication or distress signal since then and feared for the worst after several searches yielded no sign of it within two days.

Local fishermen who were out at sea told CNN that they spotted an unfamiliar ship in rough weather conditions around 10:30 am on March 12th, with visible signs of struggle among its crew members as the hijackers boarded through their lifeboats without resistance. They could not provide any further details due to foggy visibility and had fled back into Somali waters after witnessing suspicious activity at sea for several hours prior that day before being unable to return because of deteriorating weather conditions in international waters near the Horn of Africa region (FOI).

Experts say this incident follows a troubling trend among pirates taking advantage of poor maritime security enforcement off Somalia's coastline. Dr Helene Boucher, Senior Fellow at International Peace Information Service comments on growing piracy rates and lackluster international response since the fall 2018 decline in attacks during reduced oil trading activities amidst COVID-19 pandemic disruinations:
"Pirates exploit vulnerabilities like this weak regional security setup off Somalia's coastline. It is high time for all nations involved to reassess their strategies and bolster efforts against criminal maritime activity." The MV Fortune was carrying a cargo of fresh produce valued at $2 million when hijacked - including apples, tomatoes, potatoes, lettuce amongst others which can potentially affect food supply chains within Yemen if not resolved soon due to the country's already fragile state amidst ongoing conflict.

Officials from both Oman and Yemen have pledged their full cooperation in this matter as search efforts continue across international waters, airspace over Somalia coastline with military vessels participating alongside civilian ones like aircraft or ships sent by these nations towards the region where pirates operate mainly within East African Sea Gap between Kenya/Tanzania-Somalia border.

"We must act swiftly to ensure safe passage for legitimate cargo shipments and stop criminals exploiting seas," stated Omani Foreign Minister Yousef Bin Rashid Al Hawamel during a press conference at his ministry office after discussions with counterparts from other Arabian Peninsula countries on ways forward regarding maritime security issues in the region.

The MV Fortune is currently believed to be offshore Yemen near Aden port where it was originally due for arrival before hijackers took control, but no further details about what transpired between pirates and ship's crew members are yet known nor has any communication been received by the vessel. Its owner claims they tried multiple times sending SOS messages via satellite phone without receiving answers even after providing explicit instructions detailing their plight in each message sent over a period of days leading up to its hijacking, causing concern among maritime industry players and regional authorities who fear for lives at stake while also considering impact on already fragile global food supply chain due presence-at-sea nature of this crime
