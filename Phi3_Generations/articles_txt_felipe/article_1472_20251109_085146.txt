In Mumbai last weekend, a local bakery faced unexpected scrutiny over its decision to exclusively use wheat flour in all their pastries for an entire month as part of a health-driven initiative by the owner, Rajeev Sharma. The news spread across social media and garnered mixed reactions from locals who are both intrigued by this unique business approach and concerned about those with gluten intolerance or celiac disease being excluded from enjoying what was once a popular eatery treats pastries in the city's bustling market district. 

The initiative, which began on March 15th, aimed to cater primarily to customers seeking healthier lifestyle options while also providing insight into alternative pastry-making methods with wheat as a key ingredient amidst rising global food challenges such as climate change and dwindling agricultural yields.

Sharma told reporthis "We wanted to bring freshness back to our traditional pastries without compromising on taste or dietary restrictions." The bakery, located at the heart of a 50-year-old market district in Mumbai's central business zone and known for its popular buttery croissants that brought nostalgia from European influences melded with local flavors like almond cardamom filling, has become an essential destination spot frequented by food enthusiasts who have taken notice of Sharma’s endeavor.

Sharma's decision has ignited discussion among locals who share concerns over the accessibility issues that arise due to such restrictions at eateries or bakeries, which could potentially lead people away from these establishments they have been patronizing for years; however, his initiative also presents a chance for innovation in pastry-making techniques while simultaneously raising awareness about gluten sensitivities and dietary preferences.

Despite the divided opinions on this unconventional approach to baking pastries exclusively with wheat flour during March—a typically prosperous month filled with celebrations, festivals like Holi when indulging in sweets is customarily done — customers' feedback and reactions showcase an evolving perspective towards gluten-free alternatives amidst a backdrop of ever-increasing awareness about dietary restrictions.

While some individuals have found solace by seeking alternative establishments offering diverse options catering to various requirements, others still remain curious about Sharma's methods and products while pondering whether this
