A massive landslide in Greece has trapped dozener of residents at a remote Alpine resort town on Monday morning. The disaster occurred near Orizova village close to Mount Olympus National Park and is being described as the most significant event for decades, affecting not only tourism but also local livelihoods dependent on mountain agriculture and eco-tourism ventures that are integral parts of Greek Alpine economy.

"It's one of those rare tragedies where Mother Nature shows no mercy," said a mayor from the nearby town, Yannis Tzortzos as rescue operations were underway on Monday morning. The landslide involved around 15 people who reportedly lost their homes while staying at Meteora Hotel in Orizova and its surrounding areas.

The National Met Service confirmed that heavy rainfall leading to land instability might have triggered the disaster late last night, although local officials are yet unable to confirm any concrete factors as of now due to limited accessibility caused by debris piles blocking roads near Meteora village at around 10 a.m..

"This is an unprecedented situation that we've never experienced before in this region," added Tzortzos, "It seems like the worst part of it might be yet to come." An estimated two million Euros (about $2.4M USD) worth property damage has already been reported but experts believe that number could escalate with more cascading rockfalls anticipated throughout this Alpine region known for its unstable terrain and extreme weather conditions during the rainy season from April to October.

Emergency services, Greek army units along with firefighters are working around-the-clock since yesterday in an effort to find survivors who might be trapped under rubble or debris while also looking out for further rockfalls that have already claimed a few more victims within the last two days. A preliminary report by the National Geological Survey (NGS) suggested some form of structural weakness in Meteora's ancient sandstone structures, wherein 16th-century monasteries built atop pillars dating back as far as Roman times stand tall against harsh weather conditions.

"This is a catastrophic event with long term implications for our local economy," said Maria Apostolou, Director of Meteora EcoTourism Agency in Orizova village which contributes to 40% (around $6M USD) annual tourism revenue. "We need immediate support not just from government agencies but also international NGOs."

Emergency services were able to reach the disaster site after several hours of struggle as helicopters and off-road vehicles maneuvered through rough terrain with debris piles blocking main access roads. The Greek army was assisting in clearing pathways while local businesses, schools, monasteries have been evacuated or temporarily closed due to the situation at hand wherein residents are currently staying outside Meteora town awaiting a better understanding of safety risks and structural stability assessments from geologists.

"I never thought it could happen here," expressed one terrified mother, Helen Papadopoulos who lost her daughter Maria in the disaster while visiting family last weekend before they were caught by surprise when their hotel room collapsed under them as a result of landslides which also saw several other guests being swept away into
