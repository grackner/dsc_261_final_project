In a startling development last Tuesday in Baghdad, Iraqi forces led by Brigadier General Ahmed Al-Shibli successfully reclaimed control of downtner Abbas street from suspected insurgents. This operation has significantly reduced the city's fear among citizens and is regarded as a major step forward against growing terrorism across Iraq.

Brigadier General Ahmed Al-Shibli, commanding officer leading forces on behalf of Baghdad police during Sunday night's raid in Abbas street, stated "Our mission has been accomplished with minimal casualties and we expect to maintain order hereafter." The operation started at around 9 p.m., after residents reported suspicious activities the previous day that indicated a potential insurrection by unknown forces operating under cover of darkness.

Eyewitness Iman Qasim, who lives near Abbas street told CNN local reporters "For months now we've been living in constant fear and anxiety." She recounted hearing gunshots late at night but was not aware that a major security operation had just begun. Upon learning of the situation from friends outside her neighborhood on Monday, she shared relief: “I felt safe to step out for my morning coffee again.”

"These threats are deeply disturbing and undermine our progress towards peace in Iraq," said Ambassador Martin Kobelt, a German diplomat stationed in Baghdad. "The courage shown by Brigadier General Al-Shibli’s forces reassures us that international security efforts continue to make strides."

Local officials are working closely with the United Nations and neighboring nations' intelligence agencies seeking information on potential external backers of insurgents in Iraq. While no concrete leads have been found so far, a UN official emphasized how necessary this cooperation is: "The fight against terrorism requires unity not just among our countries but within civil societies across the world."

Saud Abdullah Al-Marzook, a local businessman and expert on security issues told DailyMail that while celebrations have been subdued due to cautious optimism. “I believe we are finally seeing progress in rebuilding Iraq's internal stability," he stated. "But it will take sustained international support for us truly turn the corner."

In response, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki promised more forceful action and stricter security measures throughout Baghdad: “We’ll continue to root out any elements that seek violence or instability in Iraq.” He appealed nationwide citizens as well. "I ask all Iraqi brothers and sisters not to lose hope," he concluded, promising a united front against terrorism."

The Brigadier General's office will hold daily press briefings starting from Wednesday providing updates on the operation till completion along with strategies for preventing future attacks. As citizens express relief over reclaiming safety in their city and authorities promise to uphold this newfound security, Iraq stands united against insurgency amidst international support bolstering local forces' efforts throughout Baghdad and beyond its borders towards long-lasting peace within the country.
