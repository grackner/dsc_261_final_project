A rare astronomical event will grace skies above New York City tonight on August 12th as an annular solar eclipse coincides with a lunar supermoon - something scientists predict hasn't occurred for millennia in the region, reports CNN. The alignment happens when the moon is at its closest point to Earth during the full moon phase and passes directly above it but fails to obscure all of the sun as an annular eclipse does; instead a ring or "ring of fire" remains visible around the edge because the moon appears slightly smaller in size, according to NASA. This combination can only occur when the Moon is at its apogee (the farthest point from Earth), but simultaneously during a full moon phase and lunar perigee where it's closest - this "perfect alignment" happens once every 173 years for those in New York, reports DailyMail.

The next time an annular solar eclipse will occur directly above the city is July of 2095, says a professor at Stony Brook University who studies these phenomena as part of his research into celestial mechanics and astronomy Dr. Michael Taylor (not real person). "This alignment presents us with this rare spectacle - something that hasn't been seen for nearly two centuries here in New York City," he says, emphasizing the rarity by noting it only occurs once every 173 years due to our planetary tilt and orbit.

The eclipse will be most visible at night during which residents can watch from outside while street lamps provide illumination or even head out for an observatory party organized on rooftops across Manhattan's boroughs, he notes. "It offers a unique opportunity to observe such celestial events in their natural habitat," says Dr. Taylor as people prepare with eclipse glasses and viewing parties set up by amateur astronomers like Emily Johnson (not real person).

Johnson tells DailyMail she plans on organizing an observation party for friends tonight, but also wants to remind everyone about safety when observing solar eclipses. "Sunglasses won't protect your eyes from the sun’s harmful rays," Johnson advises as a precaution before sharing her own excitement: “It will be an incredible sight; I can hardly wait.”

As nighttime approaches and New Yorkers eagerly await this cosmic show, local astronomy clubs like The Eclipse Observers of Long Island (TOLI) have been busy preparing telescopes. "We're excited to share the wonders above us with more people than ever before," says TOLI President Rachel Greenwood (not real person).

Experts remind observers that while looking directly at a solar eclipse can cause severe eye damage or blindness, safe viewing methods include specially designed glasses and pinhole projectors. As New Yorkers prepare to experience this once-in-a-lifetime spectacle together with family and friends tonight under the starlit sky - it's clear that nothing will ever be quite ordinary again as we come face to face with a rare, beautiful alignment of our moon, sun, and Earth.
