In a groundbredependent move aimed at revitalizing local journalism and countering misinformation in business reporting, City University has unveiled its inaugural Master's program focused on Media Studies with an emphasis on Business Reporting Ethics this past Thursday. The announcement was made by Dr. Elizabeth Harrington, the Dean of Graduate Studies at CityU London Campus during a press conference in central Edinburgh and comes amid growing concerns about declining trustworthiness within business media outlets across Europe.


The program will be delivered entirely online with an intake capacity for 30 students initially but is expected to expand based on demand, reports the University Times. It has already garnered significant interest from industry professionals and journalism academia alike who recognize this as a necessary response to emerging ethical issues in business reporting that have been eroding public trust over recent years.


Dr. Harrington expressed her vision for graduates of the program, stating "Our aim is not just academic excellence but practical leadership – equipping students with both knowledge and moral compass essential when confronting today’s misinformation crisis in business media." In response to concerns about declining standards within industry reporting, she highlighted that this course would offer rigorous training on ethical journalism techniques.


"I think it's high time we invested more heavily into ensuring our news is not just informative but trustworthy as well," shared John McArthur, a senior journalist at the Edinburgh Business Journal who attended the conference and expressed interest in applying for the program. "Within my career so far I have seen too many instances where speed trumps accuracy."


The University Times reports that CityU is planning additional seminars to discuss strategies of verification methods, fact-checking processes while also addressing issues such as bias and transparency in reporting with guest speakers from credible media organizations. 


CNN/Business Reporters Association President Jane Smith has been invited by City University for a lecture next month at the London Business School to discuss ethical standards within business journalism further, stating "These kinds of programs are exactly what we need if there's any hope in regaining public trust." The course launches on September 15th and students will commence their courses immediately.
