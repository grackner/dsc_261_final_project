March 28, 2023 — A sleep study released today reveals a disturbing trend among teenagers in urban areas of Los Angeles and New York City: the prevalence of insomnia has increased by nearly 45% over the past five years. The findings have alarmed healthcare professionals who are concerned about long-term effects on mental health, academic performance, and overall wellbeing.

The study conducted between November and December last year interviewed more than two thousand teenagers aged twelve to eighteen across selected schools in Los Angeles and New York City with the help of their parents' consent. A sleep specialist from a local university analyzed data gathered on bedtime routines, screen time before sleeping, physical activity levels during day-to-day activities, as well as stressors such as academic pressure or family conflicts that could contribute to insomnia and poor sleep quality among adolescents in these two cities.

One of the most significant findings from this study shows an alarmingly high number — 68% -of teenagers reported difficulty falling asleep within a week while only about half (51%) felt rested when they wake up at nighttime due to anxiety, stress or physical discomfort. Dr. Maria Sanchez, one of the leading sleep experts involved in this study noted that "Teens are facing more pressures and demands from academic achievements, social media presence as well an increasingly digitized lifestyle all while their biological clocks signal bedtime hours."

As per findings drawn by Dr. Sanchez’ team of researchers with statistical analysis using Sleep Health Index (SHI), Los Angeles teenagers were found to have the highest levels, at 47%, and New York City came close behind in third place with a figure that stood around thirty-eight percent [9]. This study was supported by grants from National Institutes of Health for addressing adolescent health concerns.

Another expert on child psychology who reviewed the findings, Dr. Thomas Miller believes this insomnia crisis is closely linked to a surge in anxiety disorders reported among teenagers since 2018 when an online harassment scandal broke out nationwide [3]. He shared that "Parents often unknowingly contribute towards poor sleep habits of their kids with late-night technology exposure before bedtime. We need to educate both parents and children about digital detoxing especially at night hours."

To mitigate the problem, Dr. Sanchez suggests adolescents limit screen time two hours prior to bedtime; establish a consistent sleep schedule even on weekends while avoiding caffeine-containing drinks before going to bed [7]. She emphasizes that "These simple measures can significantly enhance an individual's overall mood, improve academic performance and minimize the risk of physical health issues such as obesity or heart problems."

CNN reached out Dr. Miller for comment on his thoughts regarding these findings but did not receive a reply by press time today; while he was reportedly speaking at an international conference in Boston last weekend about digital wellness and its implications on adolescent mental health, with possible follow-up studies to be conducted next year.

Sanchez's team is calling for government interventions towards promoting sleep hygiene education amongst teenagers as part of a broader approach dealing not only the alarming rise
