A powerful cyclone is set to hit coastal regions of West Bengal in India on Friday afternoon with wind speeds expected to reach up to 120 kilometers per hour. Residents are urged by local authorities to evacuate the most vulnerable areas and prepare for heavy rainfall, which could last several days following landfall before weakening as it makes its way towards Bangladesh.

The cyclone will be moving inland from Jharkhand state on Friday around midday with maximum wind speeds anticipated to reach 120 kilometers per hour at the core of the system, according to officials and meteorologists closely monitoring its development. Residents have been warned about potential damage similar to what was observed during Cyclone Amphan in September last year when extensive property loss occurred due to high wind speeds combined with flooding from heavy rainfall that persisted for days after landfall along the coastal belt of West Bengal and neighboring Bangladesh.

"We are expecting similar conditions this time around," says Anirudh Chandra, a senior meteorologist at India Meteorological Department (IMD). "The cyclone will be relatively weaker than Amphan but still pose significant risks to life and property if proper precautions aren't taken." He adds that the region is under Alert Level II which requires immediate evacuation of residents in low-lying areas as well as securing belongings.

Local authorities have already begun mobilizing rescue teams, ambulances, buses for mass transport to shelters and other emergency measures since Wednesday evening when the cyclone warning was issued by IMD after forecasting a possible landfall between West Bengal's Digha and Tamluk districts.

"We are taking all necessary steps to ensure our people are safe," says Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee in Kolkata, where authorities have begun setting up temporary shelters for evacuees on Thursday evening after a full-scale emergency operation was initiated earlier this week. "My government is doing everything possible by working round the clock to prepare for any eventuality."

As of Friday morning local time, 65,000 people have been identified as vulnerable and needing evacuation from low lying areas along with another estimated total population which could face risks due to heavy rainfall or flooding amounted up to two million. Officials estimate a significant impact on the state's economy since much of West Bengal relies heavily upon agriculture, fishery, and tourism sectors that are likely to be affected by disru0bts in infrastructure caused by wind damage along with possible loss of crops or fishing boats due to adverse weather conditions during peak harvest season.

In the meantime, aid organizations like UNICEF have already begun mobilizing relief teams and resources ready for dispatch once it is safe for them to enter affected areas following landfall before they are needed in long-term rehabilitation efforts after disbursing emergency supplies such as dry food rations, water bottles, blankets among other essentials.

Residents continue express concern about their safety and property while urging authorities not only evacuate them but also provide sufficient resources for those who are unable or unwilling to leave the area themselves due to family obligations or lack of transportation access. "I understand people may have concerns, especially if they feel unsafe leaving home," says Banerjee as she addressed rep
