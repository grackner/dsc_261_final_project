Researchers at Harvard University announced a breakthrough in climate science on Monday that could revolutionize our understanding of global warming'dependent variables and their impact,' said Dr. Elizabeth Huang, lead scientist of the study. 'Our findings suggest we may have underestimated certain aspects which has significant implications for future climate models.'

According to a team led by oceanographer Dr. Michael Chen from Cambridge University in England, sea surface temperatures play an even more vital role than previously thought when it comes to accelerating global warming and shifting weather patterns worldwide. Their study, conducted over the course of six years with data collected between 2015-2021 across five different oceanic regions — Pacific Ocean near Australia; Atlantic side off Newfoundland in Canada; Gulf Stream area close by Miami; South China Sea bordering Vietnam and Malaysia; Northwest Indian Ocean from Cape Town, South Africa to Sao Tome Island - West African nation.

Climate experts worldwide have hailed Dr. Chen's work as a major leap forward in understanding how human activities are contributing towards the Earth’s rising temperatures and increasingly unpredictable weather events such as hurricanes, heatwaves or drought conditions,' stated Prof. Jonathan Edwards from Stanford University who has spent decades studying climate change effects on small island nations like those surrounding Tuvalu in South Pacific Ocean region - where sea levels have been observed rising faster than the global average due to melting glaciers caused by increased greenhouse gas emissions'.

The study points out that one key factor driving changes is ocean warming resulting from more carbon dioxide being absorbed into our atmosphere as burning fossil fuels. This trapped heat then causes sea surface temperatures (SST) to rise which in turn amplifies global temperature increases and affects atmospheric circulation patterns responsible for severe weather events globally such as intense storm systems over North Atlantic Ocean near UK or South Pacific Islands like Fiji during recent years of record-breaking rainfall leading experts fear potential worsening conditions if immediate action isn't taken.

In response to these alarming developments, international organizations including United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and World Meteorological Organization are calling upon global leaders at COP26 conference in Glasgow Scotland later this year for urgent measures towards reducing carbon footprint by implementing stricter regulations over industrial activities emitting greenhouse gases into atmosphere while promoting renewable energy sources instead.

Industrial sectors like oil and gas production, electricity generation plants burning fossil fuels are identified as top contributors to human-caused climate change; hence policies aiming at reducing reliance on non-renewables within these industries could lead significant progress towards slowing down global warming trends in near future based off past experiences when countries took aggressive steps against air pollution such as China halving smog levels since 2013 after introducing mandatory emission standards across their manufacturing sector among other measures.

Public awareness campaigns encouraged governments worldwide to prioritize sustainable development and invest heavily into green technologies like solar panels, wind turbines or hydroelectric power plants which provide clean energy alternatives with minimal impact on environment compared traditional coal-fired power stations that contribute high amounts of carbon dioxide emissions.
