A powerful tropical storm made landfall in Florida early Thursday morning as forecasters struggled to predict its path amid concerns of heavy rainfall and strong winds affecting coastal communities along the Sunshine State's east coast, according to The Washington Post. Meteorologists at the National Hurricane Center have been monitoring Storm Grace for nearly a week now; however, on Thursday morning local time in Melbourne Beach, Florida, residents woke up with no warning as powerful wind gusts buffeted homes and trees were uprooted from yards across Tampa Bay County.

"I was just finishing breakfast when I heard the first one coming through my bedroom window," said 67-year old retiree Jim Peterson, who witnessed Grace's onset as he sipped coffee at his patio table in Clearwater Beach. "Next thing you know, it felt like an explosion hit next door and knocked over a couple of trees."

The National Hurricane Center has issued several warnings for Storm Grace since Tuesday evening when the tropical storm formed offshore to its northeast in the Caribbean Sea near Jamaica. "Storm Grace is expected to bring life-thnercing winds, dangerous surf and heavy rains," said Dan Brown, lead meteorologist at a prominent national weather forecasting service based out of Atlanta who has been following Storm Grace's development closely over the past few days for one hour or more. "We have had no prior warning because it formed so quickly southwest of Cuba."

As communities scramble to prepare after waking up with little time to react, officials at Florida Department of Emergency Management warned residents in Tampa Bay County yesterday that they should not underestimate the storm's destructive potential despite Grace being downgraded from a hurricane earlier today. The first National Hurricane Center advisory for Storm Grace was issued on August 18th, with initial warnings forecasting it to be directly impactful as Tropical Depression Twenty-Three offshore by September third; the storm's rapidly intensifying wind speeds and expanding rainfall swath eventually escalated into a hurricane before finally weakening on August 26th.

"We have been trying to keep an eye out for any changes in direction," said Emergency Management Director Linda Jackson, explaining that Grace has meandered since becoming a named storm last Thursday with unpredictable shifts east and west across the Florida Straits between Key West and Miami-Dade County. "The strongest winds have always been along coastal areas; we expect heavy rains inland as well."

Emergency Management officials yesterday ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying flood zones, including communities around Tampa Bay's Intracoastal Waterway and eastern portions of the Florida Keys where homes were already underwater during last weekend's high tides. "We are taking precautions seriously as Storm Grace is expected to make landfall again by Saturday afternoon with heavy rain, strong wind gusts reaching upwards of 105 mph and waves possibly exceeding the height recorded in a previous historic hurricane during an earlier September," said Director Jackson at yesterday's press conference. "We urge everyone not wait until tonight to prepare; time is running out."
