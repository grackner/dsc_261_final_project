In a stunning turn of events during last night's championship game at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wisconsin, quarterback Tyler Sullivan threw what could be the most controversial pass in Lions-Packers history as they clashed again after their fierce rivalry. The Packers had been leading 21–3 with only minutes left on the clock when Sullivan scrambled out of bounds and, rather than throwing it away, tossed a desperate shot to wide receiver Jackson Harris in the end zone for an improbable touchdown as time expired — leaving both teams visibly shaken.

"I never thought I'd see this again," remarked Green Bay coach Tim Reynolds after the game concluded with a 28–21 Packers victory, his team celebrated but puzzled by their opponent’decisions'. Sullivan had only been in college for three years when he made history at Wisconsin University last night.

"It was an unforgettable moment," said Harris during post-game interviews with ESPN and CBS Sports Network. "I knew I could have this pass, but it felt surreal to be part of something like this." 
The Packers' offensive coordinator had the team run a risky play for any reason on their last possession after being down by more than ten points — now they wonder if that was worthwhile. "I think we made some great plays today, but I don’t know how my players feel about it all yet," Reynolds confessed later as reporters crowded around him in the locker room during a press conference on Sunday afternoon following their win over arch-rivals Chicago Bears at Soldier Field.

The Packers are still searching for an explanation behind Sullivan's uncharacteristic decision, and some analysts believe this last play could haunt them if they enter the NFL draft in 2025 seeking to select first round pick after their current contract expires next year — although no team has yet made any comments on that possibility.

"It’ll be interesting to see how things shake out," said an ESPN analyst, who noted Sullivan's history at the University of Wisconsin and his experience as a backup quarterback for three NFL teams prior joining them in college — but not quite leading offensive drives like this one. "I don't think anyone saw it coming."

The Packers are now headed to the playoffs, having just wrapped up their first ever championship season with an undefeated 16-0 record since adopting Andy Reid as coach after a disappointing 8–9 finish in his second year before hiring him — despite losing both starting quarterbacks during that time. The Packers had come into the game on one of those seasons at just .500 overall, but they were undefeated in their last three games with an average margin victory since Reid took over and this was no exception as he completed a stunning 19-of-23 pass attempts for 246 yards while only throwing two interceptions.

Early reports from fans suggest the touchdown catch by Harris has become legendary on campus, with many saying Sullivan's decision changed their perception of college football forever — even if it wasn't a wise one at that moment in time as they had 1:02 left to play.
"I knew this was going down when he made the run," said University of Wisconsin student Mark Johnson during interviews
