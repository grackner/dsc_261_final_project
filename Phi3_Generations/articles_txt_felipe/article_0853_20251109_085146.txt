In a remarkable turn of events that could redefine urban sustainability efforts globally, researchers at Johns Hopkins University have unveiled their latest discovery in green infrastructure – self-cleaning concrete surfaces using nanotechnology inspired by lotus leaves and hydrophobic microstructures. Dr. Emily Stone, the lead scientist on the project announced this breakthrough during a press conference held at the university's main campus yesterday (April 5).

The team has developed what they term 'nano-lotus concrete', which mimics the properties of lotus leaves to repel water and dirt, thereby significantly reducing maintenance needs. This new material can be applied in urban areas like Baltimore where rainwater runoff is a concern as it prevents pollutants from entering local streams and rivers after storms while also conserving freshwater by channeling more rainfall into the soil rather than drains during dry periods.

"Our work combines nanotechnology with ecological engineering to create surfaces that are not just self-cleaning, but actually beneficial for water conservation and urban wildlife," said Dr. Stone in her opening remarks at yesterday'th event attended by local government officials and representatives from environmental organizations alike.

The city of Baltimore has already expressed interest in incorporating this new technology into public spaces as a step towards making the municipality more sustainable amidst growing concerns over climate change effects on urban environments, said Mayor Catherine Pugh during an interview yesterday afternoon at her office where she had just met with Dr. Stone's team and local community leaders to discuss implementation plans for Baltimore specifically: "I firmly believe that by leveraging science in the service of our environment we can create healthier communities while doing right by Mother Nature herself."

The Johns Hopkins research, which began three years ago under a grant from The National Science Foundation (NSF), has garnered interest and investment offers not just for Baltimore but cities across North America. Investors see potential profit in green infrastructure solutions as they can lead to reduced maintenance costs over time while simultaneously improving water quality – something that many municipalities struggle with currently due to aging pipes, outdated sewer systems or lack of natural filtration methods such as rain gardens and bio-retention areas.

During yesterday's press conference Dr. Stone emphasized this point saying "This isn’t just about cleanliness; it is also a proactive step towards preserving our water bodies which are under increasingly severe threats from pollution." With the successful lab tests of 'nano-lotus concrete', her team now hopes to move forward with pilot projects in Baltimore.

"I think this breakthrough could be gamechanger for cities nationwide and around world," commented Dr. Mark Davis, Director at NexGen Urban Ecology Institute who was also present during yesterday's conference call where he highlighted potential impact on the environment: "If we can maintain cleaner waterways while using less energy in day-to-day management of our city resources then that is a win/win scenario for us and wildlife."

The Baltimore City Council will vote this week to allocate necessary funding towards initial pilot projects. Dr. Stone's team hopes their research on 'nano-lotus concrete’ could set the precedent for future urban development by integrating science, technology, engineering, arts & mathematics (STEAM) learning in schools as well. As Mayor Pugh put it "It is our duty to educate and inspire young
