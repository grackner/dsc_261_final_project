In a groundbredear event of science and nature's marvel, researchers at Johns Hopkins University have successfully developed new biodegradable plastic from plant-based materials that breaks down within just six weeks without leaving harmful residues in the environment. The team announced their findings on Monday following months of experimentation focused around creating a sustainable alternative to petroleum-derived plastics, which have long posed significant environmental threats due to non-biodegradability and potential for pollution.

The study conducted at Baltimore's Johns Hopkins University was led by Dr. Rebecca Richards, the head of materials science department where she has been leading a team dedicated towards innovating green alternatives that will minimize environmental impact without compromising product quality or functionality. “We’ve worked very hard over several months to develop this biodegradable plastic and I am thrilled with what we have achieved," Dr. Richards shared, adding the new discovery could be a game-changer for reducing our dependence on conventional petroleum plastics in daily life - from packaging materials to disposables like cutlery and straws."

The breakthrough came about when scientists discovered that by combining various organic compounds found abundantly in cornstarch with polylactic acid (PLA) derived from milk-based products, they could create a material which showed promise not only for being biodegradable but also resilient enough to be used as an alternative. Their testing confirmed the creation degrades within six weeks under compost conditions and leaves no microplastics behind that are commonly left by conventional plastics breaking down in landfills or oceans – a huge benefit Dr. Richards highlighted: "This is not just about creating something to replace regular petroleum-based products, it’s also ensuring we leave our planet cleaner for future generations."

The study's success was backed by data that showed the material exhibits properties similar to conventional plastic in terms of flexibility and strength while maintaining transparency. This is especially promising considering many consumer goods rely on these characteristics, such as packaging materials or disposable items like straws – both typically made from petroleum-based products which take hundreds of years to decompose naturally once disposed into the environment - a major cause for concern among environmentalists and scientists alike.

"Our material has shown remarkable properties in lab tests, but we need real world data now that is why I am thrilled about our partnership with local composting facilities," said Dr. Richards when discussing further steps taken by her team to understand how well the product performs beyond controlled laboratory conditions and if it can be mass-produced cost-effectively in commercial scales while maintaining its green promise."

Further research will now focus on refining production processes for large scale manufacturing, improving material characteristics like resistance to water or UV light exposure where necessary - all with the aim of eventually supplanting non-biodegradable petroleum based plastics in various aspects of daily life that contribute towards significant environmental pollution.

Respondents have reacted positively across multiple sectors, seeing this discovery as a potential answer to tackle massive global issues caused by unchecked disposal and mismanagement of conventional non-biodegradable plastic waste which has been identified by many experts globally as the second biggest threat after climate change.
