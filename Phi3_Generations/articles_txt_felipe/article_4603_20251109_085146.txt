A cyber-attack targeting major Indian banks disrupted online banking services across New Delhi on Thursday morning. The attack was detected at around 7:0 end and the affected institutions had to temporarily halt their digital transactions throughout a significant portion of Friday. No physical damage or loss of funds has been reported, but concerns about potential data breaches remain high as cybersecurity experts scramble to investigate the source and scope of this sophisticated attack that exploited vulnerabilities in online banking systems within several branches across New Delhi.


Industry representatives have issued statements emphasizing their cooperation with investigations led by Indian IT authorities, who are working round-the-clock using advanced forensic tools to track down the culprits behind this disruption which experts believe is part of a broader wave of cybercrime against financial institutions.


"I assure you that we're doing everything in our power to investigate and address these vulnerabilities immediately," said Rakesh Asthana, Additional Director General at India’s National Crime Prevention Agency (NCPA). "The safety and security of your assets is a top priority for us."


This latest incident follows several similar attacks on Indian banking systems in recent months. In response to these escalating threats, the Reserve Bank of India has announced increased funding towards enhancing cyber defenses at affected institutions nationwide while continuously working closely with government security agencies and leading technology firms globally for assistance.


"We've always maintained robust digital banking protocols within our organization," said Mrinalini Rao, Spokesperson of State Bank of India (SBI), one of the most significant institutions impacted by this breach. "But even with precautions in place, we understand that threats can evolve rapidly."


In an effort to reassure their customers and restore confidence in digital banking services, financial executives from affected banks will be holding a press conference on Monday morning at the NCPA headquarters where they plan to detail immediate steps taken towards ensuring such interru0ptions are not repeated.
