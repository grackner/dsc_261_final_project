In a surprising turn of events this weekend in Beijing, an unexploded grenade from WWII was discovered during routine construction work near Tiananmen Square on October 5th. The explosive device lay undisturbed for nearly eight decades until the day it was found buried approximately five feet underground by a team of demolition workers preparing to build new apartments in the historic area.

Authorities immediately cordoned off an estimated two-block radius around where the grenade was unearthed, ensuring public safety as experts worked tirelessly over several days to safely remove and defuse it. The WWII era military equipment sparked concerns among local residents about potential structural weaknesses in nearby buildings due to vibrations caused by removal procedures; thus far, inspections have shown no cracks or damages that would endanger the community's safety.

Experts from China Military History Museum collaborated with explosive ordinance disposal specialists and historians alike who brought a wealth of knowledge to understanding this unique artifact better – its history is as captivating today at 90 years old as it was decades ago when dropped by soldiers in the heat of battle. "The grenade'selarge mechanism remains intact, which provides an incredible window into wartime technology," explains Dr. Li Weiwei, curator for China Military History Museum who helped with research on this particular case and countless others from a similar era across multiple wars around the world in his work to preserve history’s treasures safely today while keeping society out of harm's way as much as possible."

The Chinese government has since declared an official investigation into how such dangerous remnants made their way back then – during times when war crime investigations were rarely conducted at home, let alone on foreign soil. According to local officials in Beijing who confirmed that all efforts will be taken by relevant departments for proper handling and safekeeping of this unexpected relic found while constructing modern-day habitats near one of China's most significant historical landmarks – Tiananmen Square, “The discovery has reminded us to remain vigilant about our past. We appreciate the importance of preserving history without endangering future generations.”
