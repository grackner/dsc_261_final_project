In a daring move that has shocked Hollywood and film buffs alike, legendary director Oliver Stone's untitled thriller project was reported stolen from his Los Angeles home studio last night around midnight according to sources close to the artist. This follows months of rumors about an ambitious screenplay written by Stone himself that he aimed to develop into a blockbuster film, with some speculating this latest development could impact its completion timeline and casting decisions already in motion. The estimated value of all materials believed stolen ranges from several hundred thousand dollars including scripts, storyboards, concept art, unmastered footage, directorial notes and original soundtracks crafted by top-tier music composers for the project's climactic scenes – a loss felt deeply within an industry that celebrates Stone as one of its most influential maestros.

"It feels like losing part of my soul," lamented Oliver, speaking to his agent yesterday evening after learning about this unforeseen tragedy through police reports and eyewitner testimonies from a local security guard who observed suspicious activity on the night in question before immediately contacting authorities. "I dedicated years of work into bringing my vision for the film closer, only to see it snatched right out of existence like an old forgotten dream."

This is not without precedent; many successful directors have had their original material lost or compromised throughout history – though usually through negligence rather than malice. As Stone's closest confidantes struggle with the reality that much of his creative work may now be beyond recovery, they are working alongside law enforcement and private investigators to track down all pieces potentially involved in this audacious heist while attempting reconstructive efforts where possible using backups stored on external drives located elsewhere within Stone's residence.

"Everyone wants answers but we need evidence before jumping conclusions," says Detective Maria Gonzalez who leads the investigation, pointing out that they are following all standard protocol and procedures without any concrete suspect as yet identified in connection with this crime at large which may or may not link back to Stone's case. "We have a team working relentlessly on every lead but until we apprehend someone responsible for taking something so personal from him – his life work- it will feel incomplete."

In the meantime, friends and family of Oliver rally around them as they grieve this unprecedented loss - some sharing memories about past successful films together while others simply offer moral support during such difficult times. "He's a force to be reckoned with on set but always so kind-hearted in person," says longtime collaborator and screenwriter, Richard Starkley recalling his fondness for Stone personally back when they worked together several years ago before going their separate ways following disputes over creative direction. "Our bond transcends this incident though as I'll forever carry memories of time spent with him making art."

The full extent and ramifications associated with losing decades worth work are yet to be determined but friends insist on finding a way forward despite what feels like an impossibly steep mountain ahead. Stone, known for his gritty anti-establishment themes throughout career trajectory thus far - ranging from the Watergate scandal exposé in 'Plumas' and to military intervention criticism through films such as 'Winter on Fire: Ukraine 2014,' remains steadfast amidst adversity while urging for
