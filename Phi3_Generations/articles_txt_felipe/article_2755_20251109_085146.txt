In a dramatic turn of events at Madison Square Garden on Sunday night during game five of the Eastern Conference finals between the Boston Celtics and Miami Heat, veteran player Mark Thompson went down with what appeared to be a career-ending injury just minutes into the first quarter. Amidst cheers from thousands in attendance, Thompson crumpled awkwardly on the court following a hard fall after racing across towards the basket for an easy layup shot attempt by his teammate Eric Johnson.

The 145-pound former All-Star was immediately rushed to a nearby hospital where doctors confirmed he had suffered multiple complex fractures in both legs, rendering him unable to walk or even bear weight on them without assistance for an indeterminate period of time - if ever again. His presence is unlikely at future games as the team will need several days yet to find suitable replacements and workload distribution strategies among remaining players after losing one of their most versatile scorers who had averaged a double-double in recent seasons.

"It's certainly not good news for our franchise," said Celtics head coach David Smith at Monday press conference, shaking his head sadly as he described Thompson’in injury and its immediate impact on the team dynamic during playoff action that has brought this storied rivalry back into focus once more after four long years apart. "He was a key contributor to our success over those past seasons, so it's devastating not only for him but also his family who have been with us through thick and thin."

Official word from the National Basketball Association (NBA) confirms Mark Thompson will undergo surgery at NYC Presbyterian Medical Center tomorrow morning to repair fractures on both femurs. Post-surgical recovery time is difficult to predict due in part because it depends heavily upon factors such as how well he responds to anesthesia and whether any complications arise during the operation itself or afterwards once out of surgery - all things beyond anyone's control at this moment since Thompson isn't conscious nor stable enough for further questioning yet.

Witnesses say that even before Thompson went down, there had been growing concerns among coaches and management circles about whether he could maintain his peak physical form as older athletes in the league continue to age - a worry shared by players themselves who are increasingly aware of how quickly injuries can happen during high-stakes playoff games. The Celtics' leading scorer, Eric Johnson has said publicly that while it would be hard not having one another around daily practices and camaraderie on court for such an extended period due to Thompson’s absence - he remains positive about the team finding ways forward once again come training camp next summer with new blood joining at various positions across board as well.

"We're a resilient group," Johnson said yesterday while attending Monday afternoon's workout session alongside fellow starters Tyler Davis, Sean Walton and Alex Rodriguez - all eager to make themselves available should the Celtics need them more than ever during this challenging time ahead. "It hurts not seeing Mark around but we know each other well enough over these years together that everyone understands how special he'll always be in our hearts despite never playing another game under center again."

Thompson’s family expressed gratitude for the outpouring of support from fans, teammates and staff since word spread quickly across social media channels after his injury.
