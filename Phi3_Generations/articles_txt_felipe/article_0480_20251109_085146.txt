A massive earthquake of magnitude 7.8 struck eastern provinces in China on Saturday evening local time, leading to multiple casualties and widespple damage across the area affected by this natural disaster. According to initial reports from emergency services, at least ten people have lost their lives as buildings collapsed under the seismic shockwaves near cities including Shantou and Zhaoqing.

The earthquake struck around 6:30 pm (1930 GMT), with its epicenter located about 24 kilometers northeast of Chikan city in Guangdong Province, as per the China Earthquake Administration's data shared on their official Twitter account. Experts are closely monitoring aftershock sequences that have already been recorded ranging from magnitude 3 to upwards of 5 since then.

"It was terrifying—I felt like we were going back in time," shares Ming, a resident who experienced the quake firsthand and had fled her collapsed home for safety grounds amidst pandemonium-like scenes outside with people frantically searching among rubble debris. "We knew it was bad when things started shaking violently under our feet."

As thousands more are displaced from their residences, rescue operations continue across the hardest hit towns and cities in Guangdong Province's east coastline with heavy machinery such as cranes already deployed while local authorities appeal for international help. On Sunday morning (UTC+8), search-and-rescue teams began working alongside military trucks loaded with medical supplies at makeshift field hospitals near damaged sites in Longyan City and surrounding areas within the quake's path of destruction that extends across provinces like Fujian, Guangdong as well.

Earlier on Saturday evening (UTC+8), several buildings had crumbled leaving vast numbers injured while gas leaks from ruptured pipelines further complicated matters for already vulnerable survivors still reeling in aftershocks even hours post-quake strikes – the death toll now rising steadily by degrees with most reports indicating that fatalities remain on a grim uptrend through Sunday morning.

"We are doing everything we can under these challenging circumstances," said Liu Xiangdou, acting governor of Guangdong's neighbor Fujian province which shares its borders and close proximity to impacted areas yet far enough away that no significant damage or loss has been felt so far apart from minor tremors experienced here today since initial quake waves dissipated weeks ago back then," Liu stated during an urgent press conference hosted at provincial headquarters in Fujian's capital city, the bustling port of Nanping which sees thousands visit each day and serves as a gateway to other regions like Shantou that bore major brunt from Saturday evening through late night Sunday morning until now.

Government spokespersons assure communities continue receiving timely updates via emergency broadcast channels while citizens are being urged not just wait but prepare for potential aftershocks or additional tremors as long-term forecasts predict several days more ahead with an elevated risk of ground shaking occurrences. "We need everyone here together now – stay vigilant and safe until it's over," warns Mayor Chen Jiehua who has been coordinating efforts alongside her fellow officials including provincial chief executive Sun Quanzhi himself at Shantou city hall for last 4
