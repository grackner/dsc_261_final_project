Los Angeles-based actress and activist Lauren Hepler has recently stepped down from her role as a director on upcoming Netflix original series "City Lights," citing creative differences with the showrunners, reports CNN entertainment desk. The decision came to light yesterday when details were leaked by insiders close to the project during an interview at Sundance Film Festival where Hepler was scheduled to speak about environmental documentaries and acting techniques before attending "City Lights" screenings this morning in Park City (Sun/Monday).

The 27-year-mediate actress, known for her roles on TV shows like "Shark Bait," had been working as a director alongside seasoned filmmakers to bring an authentic city experience into the series. However, last week's feedback during production was overwhelmingly negative among Hepler and fellow cast members regarding direction choices made by showrunner Michael Weston, leading up to her announcement on social media late Friday night (Saturday).

"I feel frustrated because my vision for 'City Lights,' which is rooted in the struggles of everyday people navigating through a bustling urban life isn't being reflected," Hepler shared. "The constant directional changes and script modifications have left me feeling disconnected from what I care about most — making stories that speak to real lives."

"It was essential for Lauren to stay true to her artistic expression in this project, but unfortunately, those expectations clashed with Michael's vision," said filmmaker Emily Stone, who previously worked on the series alongside Hepler and also witnessed their falling out first-hand. "I understand that creative differences can happen; however it seemed like an avoidable situation."

"City Lights has been garnering attention for its unique setting amidst Los Angeles' diverse neighborhoods - capturing candid moments of ordinary people in extraordinary settings," said renowned acting coach and film critic, James Carter. "Lauren brought her experience as a script doctor to the table but I can understand that not every decision was met with enthusiasm."

A series official stated yesterday at an off-the-record lunch during Festival screenings: 'Although we respect Lauren's contribution thus far, ultimately artistic differences were insurmountable.' He also added they would be seeking a new director to ensure the project remains on schedule. 

As for what comes next in her career trajectory and beyond as an actress-turned-director, it seems like Ms. Hepler is taking some time away from film sets — but with no concrete plans of returning anytime soon."
