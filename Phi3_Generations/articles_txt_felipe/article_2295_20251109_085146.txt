In a small fishing village off the coast of West Africa's Ivory Coast last weekend, three individuals were reported missing during what began as an ordinary day at sea but quickly turned into a harrowing ordeal for their families and friends back home. As international search efforts continue to this day without any sign of survivors, authorities remain baffled by the disappearance that took place on March 15th when three fishermen set out before dawn from Abidjan's port in search of a rare species believed to be offshore at depths ranging between five and fifteen meters.

The sudden silence enveloping their fate struck families still grieving the loss or mishap that led them into harm’in two months ago when one such fisherman drowned, prompting stricter safety measures for all who venture out in search of livelihoods at sea around this time. "Life is uncertain and even more so on water," lamented Chief Fisheries Inspector Yaya Coulibaly as he addressed a somber crowd gathered outside the port where families had come to pay their respects, hoping for some clues or news that might bring closure amidst an unsettling atmosphere thick with uncertainty.

Investigators have struggled since then against strong ocean currents and limited resources while keeping up hope despite mounting evidence suggesting nothing but tragic loss awaited those who ventured beyond sight of land on the day in question - sunny yet ominous weather providing an ill-fitting canvas for these dire events. Fisherman's union leader, Koffi Awoa, recalls that many members felt confident about this particular journey: "We always take our boats out when we feel like it," he said recently during a meeting with fishermen back in the port after another disheartening day without news or progress on their friends' whereabouts.

"I remember telling my family before they left - I knew something was off about this one trip, but you can only ask so much from people who work tirelessly to put food on tables every single night." Those words now echo with unfinished business as families await news that has not arrived in nearly two months. While authorities maintain a presence near the area where fishermen reportedly went missing last month - approximately 10 kilometers off Abidjan's coast and underwater terrain marked by reef-laden stretches known for their unpredictability given depth variations throughout different seasons of upwelling tides, there remains little concrete evidence to pinpoint exact coordinates where they might have encountered trouble.

Local fishermen themselves offer few insights into the day's events beyond what is commonly shared: "We were just trying our luck catching some fresh-water prawn and lobster as usual," says a weathered older man, speaking in broken English that seems to carry years of hardship on his back. His wife continues her own version from their home at the shore line where she prepares meals for family members who arrived bearing gifts hoping against hope: "We just went out there like any other day with our nets and we never heard a word about them coming in or heading towards land."

Experts warn that searching deeper waters around Ivory Coast is increasingly hazardous due to climate change, causing greater unpredictability of ocean currents which can disorient vessels even for experienced navigators. "Our research points us toward warmer sea temperatures and rising tides," says marine biologist Dr Niama
