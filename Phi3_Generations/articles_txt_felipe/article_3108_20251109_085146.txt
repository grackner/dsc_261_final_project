As autumn leaves begin to fall in New York City this year, a unique culinary event has caught attention far beyond its borough boundaries: The "Taste of Times Square." For the first time since before lockdown protocols were implemented last year, thousands gathered at Madison Square Park for an unprecedented three-day food festival celebrating iconic New York dishes from around the globe. Set to take place this October 15th - 17th in a reopened park atmosphere respecting COVID-19 safety guidelines, Taste of Times Square is set to offer an array of eats that encapsulate the city’s vibrant food scene and diverse cultural influences.

"We wanted to bring back what New Yorkers love most - sharing good food with friends," says Emily Chenoweth, one of the festival organizers from The Big Apple Gourmet Collective based in Midtown Manhattan. "It’s our way of showing that despite everything we've been through, the spirit and camaraderie found at these events remain as essential to us."

As guests enter Madison Square Park on Friday evening—October 15th after a series of COVID-safe checks and temperature screenings—they are greeted by colorful booths lining every inch of available space, each representing an international cuisine but all rooted firmly within the framework of New York's own. From Korean BBQ tacos to Brazilian feijoada sliders, attendees can embark on a culinary journey through not only various cultures but also taste their melding with American flavors and traditions that have always been inherent in this melting pot of cities' food culture.

Renowned chef Antonio Martinez expressed excitement about the event, adding how it represents hope for many restaurants struggling to recover post-pandemic: "I believe these types of gatherings are essential ingredients not just for gastronomic delight but economic recovery too," he says while setting up his dish station.

The festival features live music by local acts playing classic New York jazz, rock 'n' roll and Latin beats under the bright summer sky with a string quartet performing at selected intervals throughout the day to provide intimate acoustic experiences for smaller gatherings of food enthusiasts willing to break away from larger crowds. The festival will also host an array of cooking workshops led by chefs specializing in various international cuisines, allowing visitors not only to indulge their taste buds but gain knowledge on how those dishes are made and where the ingredients come from—a nod toward sustainable food practices.

The Taste of Times Square will host an impressive lineup over its three-day run: New York City's own celebrity chefs, local restaurateurs, community leaders like NYC Mayor Eric Adams who took note on social media praising the event for reinvigorating communal gatherings. "These festivals remind us of our shared experiences and human connection," he stated in a tweet while visiting another festival last month that also brought back live music as an act against loneliness amidst isolation during lockdowns, hoping similar joy could be replicated with this one-of-a-kind event.

Experts on community cohesion and the social impact of events like these see Taste of Times Square as a vital step forward in New York’s path to recovery after
