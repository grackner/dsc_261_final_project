In a stunning move towards incorporating opulence into education spaces, Harrods department store has unveiled plans for its newest venture in London's Knightsbridge on Tuesday: The Royal Luxury Academy of Fine Arts (RLAFA). This prestigious institution is designed to cater exclusively to the crème de la crème elite from across Europe and beyond, offering a hands-on immersive luxury experience alongside traditional artistic education.

The multi-million dollar venture will take up 40,000 square feet of Harrods' already expansive real estate at the heart of London’ endless fashion mecca and is expected to open its doors in September this year with an intimate initial class size of just forty students. The Royal Luxury Academy promises a refined learning journey where aspirants will not only learn about classic fine art techniques but also delve into modern luxury design, interior decorating haute couture fashion and exclusive watchmaking skills from some of the best-known names in these fields across Europe - all within Harrods' world renowned retail environment.

"It is our dream to blend traditional education with a touch of high society extravagance," said Peter Johnson, head of RLAFA whose credentials include years spent apprenticing under the likes of legendary British fashion designer Stella McCartney and Parisian haute couture master Jean-Paul Gaultier.

For many in style circles who have closely tracked Harrods' latest ventures over decades, this is not just an announcement; it marks a pivotal moment that redefines luxury education for the 21st century while keeping its roots firmly planted on British soil - quite literally since all RLAFA’s courses are planned to take place within Harrods' impressive indoor-outdoor shopping mall.

A significant draw of this academy, which will offer both full and part-time learning programs for individuals aged 18 or above with an annual income exceeding £200k is its promise to provide personal mentorship from some of the world's best designers while providing hands on experience in working within one of Britain’s most iconic fashion houses.

Anonymous sourced reports indicate Harrods has lined up a roster that includes esteemed names such as Italian luxury brand Giorgio Armani, French designer Yves Saint Laurent and British haute couture virtuoso Stella McCartney to teach at the new institution but no official confirmations have yet been made.

"We hope this unique educational platform will not only impart technical skills needed in fashion and design industries," said a senior Harrods executive, "but also nurtures individual style expression within our students." The school’s curriculum includes courses like Haute Couture Techniques with Michel Gondry (Stella McCartney), Watchmaking Mastery under Alain Monneau and Luxury Furniture Design from French designer Marc Newson.

The RLAFA project comes as Harrod's faces competition in the luxury fashion space, such as London’s newest boutique Brompton by Selfridges which opened its doors last month to coincide with a partnership deal between parent company LVMH and Parisian department store Le Bon Marché.
