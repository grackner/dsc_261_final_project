An unprecedented disruption in Southeast Asia' endangered a multi-billion dollar supply chain last Thursday when tropical storm "Evelyn" hit the region with sustained wind speeds of up to 75 mph. The economic fallout has been significant, leading businesses and markets across various sectors—particularly manufacturing, logistics, retail, technology firms, agriculture producers, seafood distributors, energy providers, healthcare organizations, real estate developers, financial institutions such as banks or credit unions, insurance companies like AIG, international shipping and air cargo carriers—to brace for potential impacts. 

"The storm's path has taken us by surprise," stated CEO of Pacific Manufacturing Ltd., Sarah Chung at the weekend press conference held in Singapore on Sunday night with experts from government agencies, international trade organizations and industry analysts as well as representatives for affected businesses. "We are working round-the-clock to assess potential damages."

Sources indicate that initial damage reports show 30% of factories shut down operations immediately following the storm's landfall near Jakarta on Thursday morning, with an estimated $12 million in losses already tallied. Retail outlets were forced to close for days due to transportation disru0ptions and power shortages that followed as a result of floodwaters overtaking parts of the capital city along with surrounding regions like Bali, Kuta (where most tourist-related businesses are concentrated), Jakarta Bay. 

"Our seafood suppliers have been severely affected," explained President Raden Adi Setiawan at a local fish market in Semarang earlier on Sunday evening with regional officials and national experts discussing ways to quickly restore supply chains across sectors, especially as Christmas holidays approach when international demand for certain goods is historically higher than usual. "We're working closely with our logistics partners here."

According to the National Disaster Response Agency headed by Minister of Home Affairs Bambang Tri Yulandari who spoke at a press conference held in Jakarta on Friday afternoon, approximately 10% of transportation links across affected areas are still under repair while some have resumed operation but with caution due risk assessments. "We hope to restore all roadways and port operations by the end of this week," he said, adding that it may take several weeks for normalcy in certain regions which remain submerged even after floodwaters recede over most affected areas including Jakarta Bay; Surabaya's northern coastal region where many businesses are concentrated as well parts still recovering from the devastating 2018 tsunami that hit Aceh province on Indonesia's far western tip.

Insurance companies, credit unions and banks have begun reviewing policies of affected parties to ensure proper coverage is in place for potential claims while a relief fund has been established with contributions from business associations including The Federation Council (Indonesian Chamber of Commerce), Business Association Indonesia among other organizations as well donations by international corporate partners like Google, Microsoft and Intel.

Businesses are encouraged to submit documentation such as inventory lists or proof for losses suffered due the disruption caused along with a list of urgent requirements including spare parts needed for repairs which will be prioritized based on criteria established through consensus
