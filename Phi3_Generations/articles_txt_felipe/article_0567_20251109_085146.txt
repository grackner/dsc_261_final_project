A massive fire engulfed a major industrial complex in Gujarat, Western India early Tuesday morning local time as workers were preparing for their day shift. The incident claimed the lives of three employees and injured an additional ten before crews managed to bring it under control after several hours of relentless work by over fifty firefigranters from neighboring regions; however, officials anticipate significant repercussions on local businesses dependent on operations at this facility which specializes in chemical processing.

Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani expressed his deepest condolences to the families of those who lost their lives and promised a thorough investigation into potential causes of fire, while experts are analyzing footage from security cameras for possible clues as well. "As we mourn our fellow citizens' tragic loss today due to this disastrous event," stated Chief Minister Rupani during his morning press conference on Tuesday at the State Secretariat in Gandhinagar, Gujarat capital city of over two million people about a third which size resides here. "We must also remain committed and determined as we continue our efforts towards bringing back normalcy to this affected area."

One factory worker who worked close to where flames were spotted reported seeing sparks flying through the air around 2am local time before he was able to escape when his supervisor alerted him of impending danger. "I heard loud noises, and saw smoke coming out from some machines," said Rakesh Patel while sitting outside in a nearby parking lot trying not to think about what happened inside the factory just steps away; still shaking off nightmares caused by these horrors he endured for three long days after witnessing it all. "We never thought something like this could happen here until today."

A preliminary investigation led so far has suggested that a malfunction in one of processing equipment might be to blame, although several other factors including faulty electrical wirings and poor maintenance work being carried out by employees themselves prior may also have contributed towards the tragic incident. The Gujarat state government's fire department chief informed media personnel present at his office that they found evidence supporting this theory while surveying damage caused after putting an end to initial blaze hours ago, but noted: "There are still aspects of our investigation which remain unclear and require further analysis by experts before drawing final conclusions."

Representatives from unions representing workers employed here at the chemical processing plant have been vocal about safety concerns raised over past months due diligently working conditions that could lead such horrific events. "Our members had continuously reported instances where hazardous materials were not being stored correctly, and many of these complaints ignored by upper management," remarked Pankaj Desai, President for Gujarat Employees' Federation; he went on to say: "It is clear from what we witnessed today that there needs be an immediate change in how this factory functions regarding its health hazards associated with working conditions and safety regulations."

Industry specialists who have followed events unfolding here since the fire erupted are advising companies operating similar processes to conduct thorough checks of equipment functionality as well ensure employees receive proper training on handling such machinery; moreover, they encourage all plants within this sector across India take extra precautions while working with highly dangerous materials.

As authorities work tirelessly towards determining the cause behind these devastating events and bringing justice to those affected by them in their quest for improvement of safety standards
