A massive earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 7.8 struck near Beijing late Thursday night, causing widespinning panic and significant structural damage across the capital city before early Friday morning tremors subsided. The quake occurred at approximately 10:32 PM local time on Wednesday when a depth was estimated to be around four kilometers (two miles) beneath Sichuan province, which lies some distance from Beijing but still affects it with seismic waves due to the proximity of fault lines.

"Our initial reports indicate that numerous buildings in downtown areas such as Xicheng District and Dongcheng have sustained severe damage or collapse," stated Jin Hu, a geologist at Beijing University. "Residents reported feeling intense shaking for up to two minutes." Many people were evacuated from hotels where they had planned their stay during the peak travel season in China's capital city due to fear of potential aftershock tremors and safety concerns surrounding some structures that might not withstand further seismic activity.

The epicenter, located 80 kilometers (50 miles) from Beijing but closer to Sichuan province at an estimated depth of just over four kilometers beneath the Earth's surface caused a powerful quake-induced tremor that rattled buildings and homes throughout several provinces. According to early assessments, this natural disaster could become one of China’s most devastating earthquakes on record if it meets or exceeds 8 in magnitude by tomorrow morning as forecasted due primarily its shallow depth beneath the Earth's surface near major fault lines – a primary factor contributing towards such significant structural damages observed across several provinces.

In addition to infrastructural damage, preliminary estimates suggest around thousands of residents from rural villages in Sichuan province have been displaced by this natural disaster; many having lost their homes completely and are now seeking shelter within government-allocated temporary housing units spread throughout affected areas like Mianyang City.

"We're working tirelessly alongside local governments to ensure our people receive adequate food, water supply, medicine and blankets," stated Yue Jingwei who serves as Secretary of Public Security for Sichuan Province; "Our rescue teams are out in full force rescuing stranded survivors amidst collapsed buildings across the impact zone."

Aid organizations have also mobilized rapidly with international partners such as Red Cross joining local relief efforts by providing emergency supplies like tents, medicine kits and food packages that can support thousands of affected families in the region. As authorities assess further damage to homes, schools, hospitals and other crucial infrastructure across provinces severely hit due this natural disaster – with more than 10 aftershocks having already been recorded since Wednesday night quake strikes; many are calling for additional international support in their continued efforts towards relief amidst recovery.

In Beijing, where the capital city still remains relatively unaffected by heavy damage as compared to its provinces counterpart – nonetheless this major natural disaster has shaken confidence among residents and tourists alike who had planned trips into nearby rural destinations like Sichuan province; authorities are urging patience amidst ongoing efforts towards recovery.

"We understand that the aftershocks have caused panic amongst our people, but rest assured these tremors will sub
