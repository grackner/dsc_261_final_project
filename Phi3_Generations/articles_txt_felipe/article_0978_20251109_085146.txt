In a quiet neighborhood of East Liberty, Philadelphia on Tuesday night, two children as young as four were found unharmed but distressed near the site where they had been allegedly abducted and held captive for almost three days. The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children announced this development in their search of 14-year-deceased suspect Drayton Pope Slager, who was apprehended after a long standoff with the police that had gripped national attention since September 25th when he took his own life.

The authorities confirmed to CNN and other news outlets on Wednesday morning via social media that children Michael Hussar (7) from South Philadelphia, PA., along with another child of similar age whose name has not been disclosed due to privacy concerns for the victim's family as per their wishes, had miracbotically escaped custody after being held hostage in Slager’s home. The children were discovered by a concerned neighbor who noticed an increase in police activity at 10:37 PM on October 8th and called authorities immediately to report what they thought was smoke coming from the house located at 245 N Fetterman St., East Liberty, PA.

FBI Special Agent-in-Charge for Pittsburgh John Rae responded promptly saying "We are deeply saddened by this disturbing development as these young children were taken into custody peacefully and cooperated fully." Meanwhile Philadelphia Police Chief Frank Fujioka voiced frustration over the situation stating, “It’s unacceptable to have people in our community live with fear every day. We will continue working tirelessly until we restore safety back home.”

The authorities immediately cordoned off Slager's property and brought a team of crisis negotiators for further investigation on October 9th; however, no one else besides the children was found or reported missing during this time in fear that there might be others involved. The FBI has now opened an active Cold Case to aid them with their investigations as they said "It is our top priority to locate and return these two young victims back safely home."

As per reports, both the children were living under Slager's care for almost three days before being found unharmed; however, it’s feared that there could be potential psychological impact due their traumatic experiences. Both of them have been placed in foster homes and are receiving counseling services to help ease any mental health concerns they might face moving forward.
