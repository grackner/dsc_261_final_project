Parents across Boston are speaking out as they try to understand their children's persistent bouts of nightmares and restlessness that began last month. Sleep consultants say the reason for this unsettling phenomenon is likely linked to a significant environmental change: artificial light pollution, according to local pediatricians who report seeing similar cases in recent years.

As Boston's bright lights blaze brighter than ever into the night sky since May 2019 due to urban development projects and new commercial buildings going up across MetroWest Massachusetts (MWMA), residents are starting to notice an impact on their sleeping patterns, particularly among children aged six months to five years old.

"Children's brains develop during this time period; they need ade endless amount of uninterrupted REM sleep," says Dr. Jennifer Foster-Smith with the Boston Children's Sleep and Wellness Center (BCSWC). She adds that "excess light exposure disrupts their circadian rhythm, resulting in insomnia or night terrors."

"I knew something was different when I started seeing an increasing number of kids come to our office with sleep issues," says Dr. Foster-Smith's colleague at BCSWC and leading pediatric pulmonologist, Dr. Laura Cheney. "They say their children have trouble falling asleep in the evenings because they can still see lights shining through bedroom windows."

Dr. Chris Johnson from Harvard Medical School concurs that increased exposure to artificial light late at night may interfere with melatonin production - a hormone critical for regulating sleep and wake cycles among children aged six months to five years old. He adds, "It's not only about the quantity of light but also its quality; blue-light emitting screens can be particularly disruptive."

Many parents in Boston report that their kids have been struggling with falling asleep since May 2019 when construction projects began to flood MWMA skies. In one such case, six-year-old Emily Baker has become increasingly fearful of the dark after spending most evenings indoors under a constant stream of blue and white light from windows reflecting off neighbor's glass facades on Beacon Hill or glaring through bedroom curtains.

"I remember always being afraid of nighttime; now I just can't sleep at all," shares Emily, who says her family tries to keep the lights low when she goes downstairs for a snack before bed, but often finds herself awake anyway as streetlight reflections bounce into view through windows even with curtains drawn tight.

According to Dr. Foster-Smith and BCSWC data showing an increase in sleep issues among children living near construction sites or city lights during this period of urban growth, she advises parents consider ways to limit exposure after dusk - such as using blackout shades or playing ambient sounds through headphones when bedtime approaches.

"We are not advocating complete darkness for kids at night," says Dr. Foster-Smith empathetically of this approach, which she has seen help some patients sleep better while maintaining safety precautions indoors during the daylight hours only if necessary outside under natural light with protective clothing against sun exposure where possible - and avoids screens altogether prior to bedtime.

Boston City Councilor Sarah Thomas agrees that more work needs done
