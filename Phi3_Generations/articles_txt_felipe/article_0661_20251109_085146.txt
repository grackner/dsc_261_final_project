In an unprecedented cosmic event that has stirred both excitement and scientific curiosity across multiple nations on Earth this weekend, a previously undiscovered comet passed within just five astronomical units (AU) of our planet's orbit – the closest any object had come since records began in the early 17th century. The Comet Zephyrus graced skies over South America last Saturday and Sunday before continuing its journey into deep space, with experts predicting a similar close encounter next year when it returns for another spectacular performance.

The comet's sudden discovery in mid-September by an amateur astronomer on the outskirts of Santiago de Chile has since captivated both professional and ambitious scientists alike, who are eager to unravel its secrets after decades spent focusing more closely with nearby celestial bodies like our Moon or Mars.

Dr. Marta Gutierrez, director of the National Astronomical Observatory in Chile said at a press conference last weekend: "This is an exciting time for us astronomers as we've been able to study and understand something so close that it was believed impossible before now." 

Zephyrus, named after its swift tail motion observed by skywatchers across the southern hemisphere during this past two-day celestial showcase, has a comet nucleus around ten kilometers in diameter – roughly twice as big compared to other well known Comets like Hale-Bopp or Shoemaker-Levy.

But it’s not just its size that's making headlines. The International Astronomical Union (IAU) announced last weekend their plans for a global comet research initiative named "Zephyrus Exploration Project", aiming to unlock the secrets of this massive celestial body and other similar phenomena in space, using cutting-edge telescopes stationed across Earth's southern hemisphere as well as orbiters.

"We need more explorations like Zephyrus right now if we are serious about advancing our understanding of the universe," says Dr. David Parkinson, Chairman for IAU Comet Subcommittee and an esteemed astronomer based in Australia. 

The comet's close approach to Earth last weekend allowed not only spectators but also scientists on hand at observatories worldwide – like Hubble Space Telescope or the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescopes, among others - an unprecedented view of this giant celests body. As Dr. Gutierrez said: "Zephyrus' journey through our solar system gives us a rare opportunity to collect valuable data that can shed light on cosmic history and evolution."

In the coming months leading up to next year’s close encounter with Zephyrus, scientists expect their workload at observatories around Earth - especially in Southern Hemisphere nations like Chile – Argentina, New Zealand, Australia, to increase. This includes monitoring comet behavior over time as it ventures deeper into space after its latest appearance near our planet and before returning for another performance next year; a spectacle eagerly anticipated by astronomy enthusiasts worldwide who might just get front-row seats at the interplanetary theatre!
