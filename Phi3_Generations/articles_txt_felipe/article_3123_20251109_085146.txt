Wake-Up Calls: Increased Occurrences of Noise Pollution in Urban Tourist Destinations – New Study Reveals Impact on Hotel Guests and Local Communities Nearby

November 24, 2023 — As cities around the world become more popular tourist destinations year after year, a new study has highlighted an unintended consequence of increased travel: noise pollution in urban lodging settings. Researchers have found that hotel guests are reporting higher levels of disturbansuitable for their rest and relaxation.

Researchers conducted interviews with 200 tourists staying at various hotels within city centers across five major destinations, namely Paris, Rome, Tokyo, New York City, and Sydney over the last three months. The study found that noise levels in hotel rooms were consistently above a tolerable threshold of 55 decibels during nighttime hours – with some guests recording peaks as high as 78 decibels while they slept nearby public parks or plazas where street performers and late-night establishments are active.

"The noise pollution in urban tourist destinations is becoming a significant concern, especially during the night when travelers should be resting," says Dr. Helen Rodriguez, lead researcher from the Urban Environmental Health Institute at Harvard University. "Hotel rooms within city centers have historically been seen as safe havens for sleep and relaxation but we've discovered that noise pollution is disrupting this."

"The problem seems to stem primarily from street performers, music venues, bars operating during evening hours near tourist hotspots," explains Dr. Rodriguez further explaining the study findings which were published in today’s Journal of Travel and Environmental Health (October 2023).

Alice Thompson, a frequent traveler to Tokyo shared her experience saying "I always dreaded my trips because I found it nearly impossible to get any restful sleep due to the noise from nearby clubs. It's not fair for guests as they shouldn’t have this constant disturbance." Apart from disrupting guest satisfaction, experts are increasingly worried about negative long-term health impact on local communities including increased risks of heart diseases and stroke associated with high levels of exposure to noise pollution.

"A continuous barrage of loud sounds can create a physically stressful environment for locals living near tourist destinations," warns Dr. Carlos Mendez, professor at the Institute of Urban Planning & Policy in Seoul University. "We need measures that control and monitor decibel levels to protect both visitors' experiences as well local communities."

In response, some hotels are considering soundproofing their rooms or relocating them away from noisy areas. However, experts argue more needs to be done by city authorities in implementing noise mitigation measures including zoning laws and regulating operating hours of late-night establishments especially near major tourist attractions that generate significant levels of environmental noise pollution throughout the nighttime.

As researchers like Dr. Rodriguez conclude, "We need to act now before this becomes a bigger public health issue."
