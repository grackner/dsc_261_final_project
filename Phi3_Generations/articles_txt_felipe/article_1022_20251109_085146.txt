It was an evening of unforeseen consequences at Hollywood's glitziest event last night when superstar Eliza Sterling found herself in a situation that garnered worldwide attention: she accidentally swallowed her diamond necklace during dinner, with the pendant eventually being retrieved through minimally invasive surgery.

Eliza was spotted at an exclusive charity gala held on Friday night at The Beverly Hills Hotel's grand ballroom in Los Angeles when what started as a simple mishap quickly turned into headlines across entertainment news outlets and social media platforms alike within hours of the incident. Authorities arrived promptly to assist, while emergency teams were mobilized throughout the city following her arrival at Saint Mark’s Medical Center early Saturday morning.

"It was an absolutely incredible moment," said Dr. Jonathan Reed, Eliza's attending surgeon during a briefing held alongside her in Los Angeles yesterday afternoon (12th). "To have such worldwide attention doesn’t happen often for anyone, let alone to someone who spent years building their career on stage and screen."

Eliza recounted the ordeal with amusement mixed with gratitude. “It felt like a scene out of some movie I once dreamt up,” she chuckled while speaking at her post-surgery interview last night hosted by Variety's leading reporters, "I never thought my biggest role in years would be as the patient!"

The diamond necklace Eliza was wearing - a bespoke piece created for actress Jane Foster to wear on set of 'Celestial Hearts', released just last year - has since been returned to its rightful owner, with an insurance claim process beginning immediately. The jewelry firm handling the case confirmed yesterday that all legal aspects regarding ownership were resolved and reimbursement would be forthcoming as soon as possible for both Eliza's lost earnings during her recovery period plus out-of-pocket expenses incurred due to unforeseen medical costs.

Eliza, who has had a decorated career spanning three decades since making it big on Broadway and leading roles across the globe - including stints as Empress Josephine de Beauharnais in 'Cleopatra’s Seduction' (2015), Queen Elizabeth I during period dramas, to more recent successes like her Oscar-nominated portrayal of Martha Graham for ‘Graham Ballet’ released last year - has not let this incident hinder the work she does.

"Moving forward," Eliza shared yesterday afternoon at a press conference hosted by The Beverly Hills Hotel, "I am determined to use my platform as an actress and advocate of body positivity to raise awareness about taking care of ourselves holistically - not just on the outside but also internally."

As for how she plans ahead with her jewelry choices post this incident? Eliza quipped: “I think I’ll stick with studded cufflinks from now on, they won't slip down my throat!"

A statement released by The Beverly Hills Hotel today confirmed that events in Los Angeles would resume as planned for next month. "We are taking this incident into consideration but our commitment to showcasing artistry through entertainment and charity is firm," the spokesperson affirmed, with no mention of last night’s mishap making an appearance
