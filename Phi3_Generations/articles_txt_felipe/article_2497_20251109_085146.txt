A devastating fire swept through a historic building in Nigeria's capital city of Abuja on Saturday evening, claiming at least seven lives and leaving hundreds homeless. The blaze broke out around 7:0 enduring inferno gutted the centuries-old Mbari House at about 9 p.m., with smoke billowing into the sky for hours afterward as firefighters battled to bring it under control.

This tragedy unfolded in Abuja's Garki district, a bustling neighborhood known for its vibrant culture and rich history. The Mbari House is considered an architectural gem of the city; built-in 1743 during the reign of Oba Dimi Agomoh II, it served as both his palace and spiritual center where he performed sacred rites to honor Iya or ancestors with intricate carvings depicting their deeds on wooden panels.

"The Mbari House is a symbol not just for our past but also represents the spirit of communal living that was so integral in Nigerian history," said historian Dr. Uchenna Onyebadi, who has studied traditional structures extensively and now works with UNESCO on preserving such landmarks across Africa."Its loss to this fire will be felt deeply by many here."

Witness Ebenezer Okonzo described seeing flames engulfing the ancient structure from his nearby home. "It looked like it was burning down before our eyes," he said tearfully while speaking with local media outlets on Sunday morning. "The firemen were trying their best but, I guess we all know what happened."

Fire Chief Officer James Okechukwu confirmed that a blaze had started in the building's basement around 6 p.m., shortly after celebrations ended for Eyo festival – an annual event held at nighttime where masked performers enact tales of village life through choreographed dances along Grand Canyon Drive outside Abuja city limits near Shehu Sardauna Road junctions just moments before the fire. Chief Officer Okechukwu says they struggled to tackle thick smoke, freezing temperatures, and slippery surfaces within dark corridors while navigating narrow stairwells with their ladders at this old building's challenging topography; ultimately exting0296_righthough several residents were rescued from upper floors still enclosed in smoke before evacuation orders.

A senior fire marshal, Lieutenant Peter Onuocha said initial investigations showed electrical issues as a probable cause of the incident but that more work needed to be done by their specialists working with utility companies' engineers at this ongoing inquiry led out Monday morning afternoon following 48 hours without rain since late November; though it was impossible for them to predict how long extinguishing efforts would continue given Abuja's climate and the building structure, he warned these fires can spread quickly especially if ignited during dry seasons like nowadays."We are working closely with authorities on ensuring safety measures but there is still much that we need learn here," Onuocha stated.

Authorities urged citizens to remain vigilant after confirming the fire left 200 people displaced while three family units and one elderly person were reported dead at first look by Nigerian Civil Protection Force commander, Major General Abdullahi
