In an unprecedented move that has rocked communities across Central America and Mexico on Friday night, over a dozen armed individuals were reported to have stormed into multiple locations in the border town of Ciudad Juárez, according to local authorities and witnesses at around 10 p.m., regional law enforcement agencies announced today.

"This is an act that has deeply shaken our city," said Miguel Angel Ruiz, a spokesman for the Secretariat of Public Security (SSP). "Our immediate priority now is to ensure public safety and catch these individuals."

The assailants allegedly broke into at least three businesses in downtner areas including El Mercado Central during peak shopping hours. They reportedly carried out a series of violent robberies, although no serious injuries were sustained by anyone inside the establishments or onlookers nearby as security forces intervened and managed to subdue suspects without further violence breaking out at around 12:30 p.m., local authorities said today.

"It was like something from a movie unfolding right in front of us," commented Lucia Gonzalez, who witnessed the attacks near her workplace next door to El Mercado Central late Friday night. "We felt safe and secure here until these unknown men just came out of nowhere."

Authorities say that this is one of the most significant criminal incidents in Ciudad Juárez since 2018 when a series of homicides led by Mexican drug cartels made headlines around the world. The assailants are described as being dressed inconspicuously and carrying automatic weapons, which have never been recovered despite intense police searches for them throughout the night until sunrise today at 6:00 AM MST (23:00 UTC).

"We're working around-the-clock to find these guns," said Commissioner Rodrigo Cardenas of the Juárez Police Department. "But we understand that their absence does not change how dangerous they were."

Crucial information from surveillance footage captured by local businesses is expected tomorrow as investigators piece together details about where exactly these armed individuals came into existence and who was behind this brazen display of power on the streets. Law enforcement bodies are collaborating with federal agencies to gather intelligence that could lead them closer towards identifying members or possible affiliations between criminal groups involved in such violent activities across border communities frequently affected by drug cartels' influence, SSP officials said today during a press conference alongside Juárez Mayor Eduardo Medina.

"We stand united as we pursue justice for these citizens whose lives were disrupted," said Medina at the same media event attended also by congressional representatives and U.S.-based NGO leaders representing interests in border security issues who shared concerns about escalating criminal activities within this region impacted historically heavily with drug-trafficking networks from both sides of our nations' frontiers."

Reactions across social media channels have been mixed, but mostly cautious and empathetic towards citizens directly affected by the recent violence - many sharing pictures or videos taken during their terrifying encounters while trying not to spread panic among friends and family back home. One local journalist wrote on Twitter: "This night has shown once again how vulnerable our community can feel, even in daylight hours."
