In a bizarre incident yesterday evening in Los Angeles that has since captured national attention, world-renowned actor and humanitarian Leonardo "Lee" Michaels was seen publicly performing an elaborate dance routine dressed as the late legendary music icon Michael Jackson inside Times Square on February 25th.

A crowd of astonished passersby gathered at about 8pm local time, witnessing first-hand what they thought to be a reenactment starring none other than Mr. Michaels himself – who is known for his incredible mimicry skills that have earned him applause from fans worldwide on several occasions in the past year alone. However, it was quickly confirmed by Lee's publicist and body double Jane Doe (who also dazzled as a backup dancer) that Mr. Michaels wasn’t part of this production after all; he had been cleverly replaced to create an enchanting spectacle worthy of the King of Pop himself, while actually supporting charity auctions in place of Jackson's own shows during his worldwide tours decades ago.

"Lee has always loved Michael and wants people to remember him for it – by dancing like their hero," said Jane Doe as she addressed reporters outside the bustling Times Square after news broke about Lee’s unexpected cameo, prompting an uproar of laughter amongst onlookers.

The impersonator who stepped into Jackson's shoes last night wasn't just anyone – he was none other than actor and philanthropist James "Jamie" Richardson Jr., 57 (the real Lee Michaels, born in Rome four decades ago is a well-respected Italian film director).

In an interview yesterday afternoon, Jamie revealed his heartfelt motivation for the costume charade: “As someone who admires Michael Jackson so much and wanted to do something good with my skills on stage," he said wistfully. "It felt like a dream come true – even though it wasn’t."

His disguise was complete enough that attendees mistook him for the legendary King of Pop until Lee's publicity team unveiled his real identity after several hours, leading to what can only be described as an 'entertainment revelation.' As if he had stepped straight out of Jackson’s Neverland Ranch himself – or rather its Los Angeles counterpart.

Times Square Mayor Michael “Mike” Brennan was quick off the bat yesterday evening when asked about Lee's performance, saying it was "a one-of-kind event that brought a lot of joy to people" but admitted he had no idea who Jamie really is until afterward – revealing his initial thought process in this unexpected situation: “As I saw him dancing like the King himself…it just looked magical.”

A city rep told DailyMail.com yesterday she was astonished when asked if Lee, not to be confused with another local celebrity named Robert "Bobby" Michaels – who had been rumored as a possible candidate for reenacting Jackson - would do it and that he has indeed done some impersonations before; but never on such an elaborate scale.

“It’s incredible how much thought Jamie put into this,” she said, “and I heard one little girl cry out 'Micheals!' when seeing him for the first time.”
