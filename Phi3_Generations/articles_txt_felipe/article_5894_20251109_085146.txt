In a groundbredependent technology hub in Silicon Valley this weekend, hundreds of tech professionals reported feeling unexplained fatigue and cognitive fog during what was supposed to be an invigorating industry conference on the latest advancements in artificial intelligence (AI). The gathering took place at the innovative SunnyTech Convention Center from Friday night into Sunday afternoon.

Attendees of all ages, including some who are experts themselves, claimed that despite ample rest and no significant health issues beforehand, they were overcome by an unrelenting wave of tiredness during their time in California's tech capital. Many cited the event as a pinnacle experience for networking with like-minded individuals within the AI field but also expressed concern about these symptoms that seem disconnected from physical causes and have left them feeling alienated by similar experiences among other professionals they met at various industry gatherings across Asia, Europe, and North America this past month.

According to Dr. Emma Thompson, a neurologist specializing in cognitive health issues related to technology use disorders, "It's important not to dismiss these symptoms as merely work-related stress or jet lag," she said during an interview last Wednesday at the conference center after touring one of SunnyTech’s exhibits showcasing cutting-edge AI research. Dr. Thompson was among a group from different tech companies who had come to discuss potential partnerships and innovations but now also find themselves pondering what she described as "a mysterious condition that seems to be plaguing professionals in the industry."

Several attendees reported feeling drowsy, having difficulty concentrating on presentations or complex conversations about neural networks. Some spoke of a sense of unreality and occasional confusion over details they could not recall learning just hours before while others felt as if their energy levels were artificially lowered despite regular exercise routines to stay fit for such conferences year-round, according to reports from the event on Saturday morning when most guests had gathered in an open area near SunnyTech's main auditorium.

The Silicon Valley AI Association has responded by opening a hotline and setting up health advisory booth at their headquarters for affected individuals seeking guidance or medical assistance, while local tech companies have offered wellness retreats designed to tackle this unexplained phenomenon head-on as part of employee benefits packages that focus on mental acuity.

"I felt like I was looking through fog," said Sarah Kim, a software developer from New York who had traveled all the way for her first international tech conference in Silicon Valley but found herself feeling unusually tired halfway into Sunday's keynote sessions and eagerly wanting to return home.

While there is no conclusive explanation or official statement on what could be causing these baffling feelings, experts suggest that the relentless pace of technological progress paired with high demands for innovation might inadvertently impact attendees' cognitive function and overall well-being.

"There is something toxic about being around technology 24/7," Dr. Thompson remarked, noting that many professionals experience their devices as extensions of themselves rather than just tools—an effect often termed the 'technoxiety'. She mentioned several theories ranging from electromagnetic exposure at tech hubs like Silicon Valley to psychological strain caused by
