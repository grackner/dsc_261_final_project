A major travel destination in Southeast Asia is facing a serious threat to its iconic landmark due to rapid tourism growth and neglected infrastructure maintenance. The Great Chao Phraya Riverboat Cruise, which has been navigating the heart of Bangkok since 1978, was reportedly found adrift in the city's main waterway yesterday morning by local residents near Rattanakosin Island (VIP area).

The boat had apparently run aground on a submerged section beneath Wat Rajaram shrine and remained there all night. The incident has not only raised safety concerns but also put significant strain on the city's efforts to manage over-tourism amidst recent economic challenges brought about by the global pandemic, including reduced international travel from China – Bangkok'de largest source of tourists for years in a row now.

"I have been sailing these waters my entire life and I never thought we would reach this point," said Somchai Saengsathan, 68-year-old local resident who helped pull the boat back to safety after initially seeing it stuck on his morning jog along Chao Phraya River.

Experts believe that an increase in cruise traffic and a failure by authorities to regularly maintain navigational markers – as well as insufficient warning systems for sudden weather changes - have led this potentially fatal situation, with the boat risking capsizing if not promptly attended quickly enough due its fragile condition from years of overuse without proper upkeep.

The 60-foot riverboat has been forced to halt operations indefinitely pending repairs and a comprehensive investigation into how it ran afoul beneath Wat Rajaram shrine during an unusually warm spring day when water levels were at their lowest after months of dry spells that the National Meteorological Department warned about beforehand.

"This incident could have been easily prevented if cruise operators had followed proper safety protocols and authorities invested more in regular maintenance," said Dr. Pongthorn Chaisaeng, director of Thailand Institute for Water Resources Planning & Management (IWRPM). "It's not just about fixing boats now but also ensuring we prioritize the well-be0f being able to preserve our city's precious waterways which are an integral part of Bangkokian culture."

The accident has sparked outcry among locals and tourists alike who had been increasingly vocal about concerns surrounding environmental impact, traffic congestion in popular areas along the river banks as well excessive noise pollution from boat horns that have become a symbolic sound of Bangkok. Experts predict this may further affect both businesses dependent on cruise services and visitors already overwhelmed by sensory assault – with experts calling for urgent measures to address these issues before they grow beyond control or cause irreversible damage in the long run as more tourists pour into Southeast Asia's booming travel hub.

In response, Bangkok Metropolitan Governor Asawin Kowed (left) and Deputy Prime Minister Phongjariya Wattanachinda met with officials today to discuss possible solutions: stricter regulations on cruise companies; better infrastructure for emergency services along waterways including more visible warning systems or sirens, as well an assessment of the current situation by transportation safety and environmental organizations.

"We understand that maintaining a balance between promoting tourism growth while preserving our environment is
