A new five-star resort in Maldives has faced allegations of exploiting local staff amid growing concerns over labor conditions within hospitality sectors across popular tourist destinations worldwide. The Paradise Pearl Resort, located on the beautiful island of Kaashidhoo which lies off the coast of Male city and established as recently as last year, is owned by a renowned hotel chain with branches globally. 


"I've heard from numerous colleagues that they are working overtime without proper breaks," shares local waitress Aisha Hassan during her shift in an interview on Wednesday evening at the resort’s luxurious dining facility, where guests have complained about their service for months. "The management is indifferent to our plight."


According to a report published earlier this week by local labor rights group The Seafarer's Shelter, an average of 35 employees at Paradise Pearl work shifts extending beyond the standard eight-hour day without overtime pay or additional compensation. These allegations have emerged as hotel staff across South Asia are voicing similar grievances concerning excessive working hours and poor living conditions in their lodgings, sparking international concern about exploitative labor practices within an industry thriving on leisrancy tourism dollars.


"We cannot turn a blind eye to the suffering of workers who form our backbone," said Dr. Anika Desai, head researcher at The Seafarer's Shelter while elaborating further details in her report released this past Tuesday night on CNN-Maldives via Skype from India where she is currently speaking about broader labor issues within the sector across South Asia as well.


While tourism officials deny these allegations stating they are investigating worker complaints and promising to address any identified misconduct, no concrete steps or promises have been made by resort owners so far which has led critics including Dr. Desai to demand immediate corrective actions from the management of Paradise Pearl Resort.


"As long as exploitative labor practices continue unchecked in popular tourist destinations around the world we risk tarnishing this industry's reputation," says James Taylor, a professor at Oxford University who is currently studying hospitality trends and labor conditions globally via Zoom interview with CNN-Maldives.


The Paradise Pearl resort spokesperson has not yet responded to requests for comment from local news outlets. However, the Maldivian Labor Ministry announced plans this past Monday evening (April 4th) a sweeping review of working conditions across all lodging sectors with specific emphasis on hotels and luxury resorts in an attempt at providing better living standards to their employees without compromising guest experience or profit margins.
