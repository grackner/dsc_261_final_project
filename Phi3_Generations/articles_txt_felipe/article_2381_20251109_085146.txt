In a historic announcement made late Wednesday afternoon in Ramallah, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas announced his intention to seek third term elections at an expanded meeting of the PLO executive committee and its leadership council (PDF). The president's move comes amidst political turmoin within Fatah, which has faced internal strife since Hamas took control over parts of Gaza.

At age 85, Abbas remains a powerful figure in Palestinian politics despite his failing health concerns and the growing demands for change among citizens nationwide who blame him for failed peace efforts with Israel. For now though, he plans to run against Mohammad Dhahok (PDF), son of President Mahmoud Zahoor Dhahok - himself a controversial figure in Palestinian politics due largely because his wife is the late PLO Secretary-General and her mother was widowed twice before by Abbas.

This decision has not come without criticism, with many saying that another term will only serve to further entrench corruption within Fatah's power structure instead of implementing meaningful reforms in Palestinian society (PDF). Some observers also question whether a third-term president can effectively represent the people when he himself is already viewed by some as an aging leader with little credibility and influence left.

"Abbas has been leading for so long, but his ability to deliver real change in Palestinian society seems lost," said Samir Makrami, political analyst at Al-Mesbar Studies Center who specializes on developments within the West Bank. "Perhaps he's still clinging onto power because that is what he knows best."

Abbas has faced calls to resign numerous times over the past decade since Hamas took control in Gaza after its violent takeover of Ramallah-based government institutions and subsequent offensive against Fatah. Despite multiple attempts, his refusal led him into exile with only a tiny fraction representing any political faction outside Palestine remaining loyal to this day (PDF).

At the time he announced on Wednesday that "the future of our struggle cannot rely solely upon me or my generation," while promising more democracy in governance if elected. Opposition parties, activists and citizens across Gaza continue voicing support for Abbas during a tumultuous period when Hamas has tightened its grip on most aspects within the territory amidst escalating tensions with Israel - including recent rocket attacks into southern Israeli cities like Ashkelon (PDF).

"Abbas's announcement was shocking to many of us here," said Hisham Salman, 24-year old university student and activist residing in the Gaza Strip. "But it also gives hope that perhaps there can still be a different future for Palestine."

As Fatah prepares its third consecutive election campaign under Abbas's leadership – with an official vote slated for October 30, reports state lawmakers are considering amending the constitution to remove presidential term limits - many wonder whether this move will simply secure his tenure or create more instability in already fragile Palestinian politics. While it remains unclear how citizens outside of Gaza feel about Abbas's bid for a third term, he has always enjoyed support within that troubled area during Fatah rule (PDF).

For now though as the 85-year old president seeks reelection with little
