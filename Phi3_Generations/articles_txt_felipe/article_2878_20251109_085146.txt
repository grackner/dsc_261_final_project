Warming Oceans Contribute to Increase in Hurricane Intensity and Frequency: Study Finds

(New York - August 15, 2023) — As the world braces for another hurricane season that is expected to be above-average due to rising global temperatures caused by climate change, researchers have unveiled new findings linking warming oceans directly with increased frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones.

The study published in Nature Communications examines satellite data from the last three decades across all major hurricane-prone regions — including Atlantic Ocean basin, where 2023's early monsoon season saw above normal activity; East Pacific Basin known for its El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) influence on storm formation and track changes which led to a record number of Category 5 hurricanes in the region last year alone.

Co-author Dr. Emily Sanders, a climate scientist at Stanford University said "Our research shows that warmer ocean temperatures provide more energy for cyclones; this leads them not only to form quicker but also develop into stronger storms." 

According to the team's calculations based on extensive sea surface temperature data and historical hurricane records, each degree Celsis increase in water temperatures has led a notable rise by around five percent in global tropical cyclone activity. Additionally, their study highlighted that with every one-degree of ocean warming there is an associated ten percent increased chance for the formation of major (Category 3 or higher) hurricanes causing damage to coastal communities across regions like South East Asia and Caribbean islands frequently in recent years including a catastrophic Category five Hurricane Pamela which hit Florida, USA last year with unprecedented destruction.

"Climate change is reshaping the face of our world," said Prof Andrew Jackson from University College London who wasn't part of Dr Sanders team but added his voice to emphasize their findings during a CNN interview on Sunday morning where he was discussing wider implications for global climate trends.

Respondents include local officials and community members, with the mayor of Miami Beach calling it "a wake-up call that Mother Nature is now outpacing our ability as humans to mitigate against extreme weather events". Meanwhile, residents from hurricane hit regions shared their firsthand experiences saying things like 'It felt unstoppable' and echoed sentiments among experts who predict this year could bring similar devastating storms if greenhouse gas emissions are not aggressively curtailed soon.

The study has been received with interest from various environmental bodies but also faced criticism regarding methodology aspects such as the complexity of hurricane formation processes which remain difficult to fully encapsulate within models and predict future behavior accurately due this inherent uncertainty - something pointed out by Prof Jackson who warned against "over-interpretation or uncritical acceptance" when discussing these findings with non-experts.

Nonetheless, the study has provided valuable insights into understanding our changing climate's role in amplifying destructive storm systems and will be used to inform future research directions while sparking crucial conversations among policy makers globally on accelerating action towards reducing emissions - actions urgently needed according to UN Secretary General António Guterres who has repeatedly emphasized that "Act now, for too
