Burj Al Arab Hotel in Dubai announces sustainability plan with net-zero energy ambitions by 2050  
Dubai — Burj Al Arab hotel has announced its ambitious goal to become a "net zero" energy establishment, marking one of the most notable steps taken within the industry towards environmental responsibility. The iconic five-star property in Dubai plans on achieving this groundbreaking milestone by 2050 through an extensive sustainability program which includes adopting renewable sources and reducing their carbon footprint significantly over time, according to a statement released yesterday from CEO Ahmed Mohammed Al Sayari.
"This is not just another initiative," said Mr. Al Sayari during the press conference on Thursday afternoon at Burj Al Arab's spacious lobby area. "We believe our hotel will set an example for all luxury accommodations in becoming eco-friendly by 2050."
In its plan, the property aims to reduce energy consumption within rooms and common areas while maximizing water conservation efforts across its sprawling establishment of over 700 suites. By employing cutting-edge technology like solar panels installed atop roofs along with wind turbines located in surrounding outskirts that generate enough electricity for daily needs, Burj Al Arab hopes to produce renewable energy exceeding what is consumed throughout the property every year from 2030 onwards.
In addition to generating clean power sources internally and externally within its walls since operations began back in 2009 as one of Dubai's most extravagant hotels offering unparalleled luxury experiences globally, Burj Al Arab also aims at cutting down their carbon dioxide emissions significantly by using cleaner fuels for transportation on and off site starting from next year.
"We are taking this as an opportunity to become more sustainable while continuing providing our guests with unparalleled service," said Ms. Fatima Juma, Director of Hotel Management Services at Burj Al Arab yesterday afternoon during a special event hosted exclusively for employees and partners in the hotel industry attended by experts discussing environmental trends within hospitality sectors globally across continents through live video conferencing technology from Dubai to London via satellite communication.
She went on adding, "This journey will not be an easy one but we are committed towards this objective with a comprehensive plan that includes education programs for all staff members and guests about climate change issues impacting our world today."
Efforts such as these by leading hospitality establishments like Burj Al Arab signify the industry's increasing awareness of its environmental responsibilities on both localized levels within their properties themselves, but also globally with regard to reducing overall emissions and adopting green practices throughout operations worldwide. As part of further initiatives aimed at promoting these efforts amongst peers through partnerships or exchange programs for employees sharing expertise while providing mutual support systems along the way towards a sustainable future together as humanity continues strives to reverse climate change impacts before reaching tipping points beyond which it becomes increasingly difficult.
