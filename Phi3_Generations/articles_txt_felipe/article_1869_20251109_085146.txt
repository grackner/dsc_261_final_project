In a startling turn of events in Georgia's closely contested gubernatorial race, allegations have surfaced that voting machines used during Tuesday night’semission may not be functioning correctly due to concerns about outdated firmware and potential software glitches. As election officials scramble to investigate the claims made by a group of cybersecurity experts on Wednesday morning, tensions have risen among politicians in Atlanta who demand answers from Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger's office regarding the integrity of their state’ s electoral process going into next week.


Cybersecurity analyst Dr. Emily Chao told CNN affiliate WSB-TV that firmware updates were overdue and could potentially lead to discrepancies in vote counting, "if not addressed immediately." Raffensperger's office has responded with a commitment for an urgent review but faces criticism from Democrat gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams who warns voters of the risk their votes may be discarded.


"We are at a critical juncture in our democracy, and it is essential that we address these concerns head-on," said Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms during an imprompt0uated press conference outside Atlanta City Hall on Wednesday afternoon where local residents expressed their worries.


CNN has reached out to election officials for further comment, while the State Election Board of Georgia is expected to hold a special session tomorrow morning to discuss these alarming developments and provide clarity as soon as possible before voters head into next week's primaries.
