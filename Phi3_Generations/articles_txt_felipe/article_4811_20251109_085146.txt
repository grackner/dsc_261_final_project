"Astronomers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory have spotted an unexpected asteroid on a collision course with Earth, potentially impacting early Monday morning near Los Angeles."  

An unidentified space rock was first detected by scientists using the powerful instruments aboard the NEOWISE infrared survey telescope last Thursday. The discovery came as no surprise to astrophysicist Dr. Elizabeth Martinez, who explained that while these sorts of celestial bodies are common in our solar system, their orbits can sometimes shift unexpectedly due to gravitational interactions with other planets and asteroids.  

"It's not something we see every day," said the experienced scientist during an exclusive interview Monday evening at Caltech Observatory headquarters where her team has been tracking this particular rock for days on end. "We can never be complacent when it comes to these threats, but fortunately in most cases, close approaches pass safely by with no danger."  

The NEOWISE telescope is currently working overtime as the astronomical community scrambles trying desperately hard not only predicting where exactly this object will go next before sundown on Monday morning, should it continue to travel toward our home planet. A 50-foot asteroid with an estimated mass of around a thousand tons has been following Earth's orbital path for thousands upon thousands years without any incidents since the last time humans have encountered them closely in history back during dinosaur era extinction times.  

According to current projections, if this space rock collides head-on into our atmosphere at speeds of around 16 kilometers per second (which are typical for near Earth objects), it will likely burn up before reaching the ground and explode in a bright fireball seen with any decent binoculars or telescope from Southern California's skies. However, some experts urged locals not to take things lightly given how unpredictable these events can sometimes be when there are factors like rogue celest09318 objects thrown off course by solar radiation pressure and magnetic fields that may change the asteroid’s path unexpectedly before it impact.  

"We're monitoring this rock very closely with our radar systems here at JPL as well, but so far everything seems stable," assured Dr. Martinez while looking out her office window toward Los Angeles below and towards space where she hoped for best-case scenario unfolding on Monday morning hours when the asteroid would be bright enough to observe through a powerful telescope lens from here or other high elevation points across California coastline areas, which is expected within next few days according to latest calculations.  

Reacting quickly yesterday afternoon upon being made aware of this potentially dangerous cosmic event happening in our backyard came Cal Poly Pomona Astronomy Club President John Smith who shared his concerns about the safety risk posed by near-earth asteroids like these ones which could be heading straight towards Earth without even knowing it due to lack sufficient observations on their paths before launching into space.  

"I just can't stress enough how important continuous monitoring of objects orbiting around us becomes," he said while standing beside one giant reflector telescope dish at Cal Poly Pomona campus which would be used as part observational tool by his team along with JPL-based instruments tracking this particular asteroid closely. "We should all take time to appreciate how lucky we are having such talented scientists and equipment working hard day in, out
