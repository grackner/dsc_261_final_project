CNN Political Correspondent Report: A Closer Look at Midterm Races and Their Potential Impact on Redistricting in Texas

In a critical juncture for the state of Texas ahead of next year's midterm elections, polls show that Democrats could gain significant ground, leading to potentially transformative changes during redistricting. 

Texas is currently seeing its highest voter turnout predictions since before Amendment 4 was passed in 1966, which grants the right for people with felony convictions to vote again after completing their sentence—a change that has significantly altered Texas's electorate. Analysts are predicting upwards of a two-point swing towards Democratic candidates if turnout mirrors projections from recent midterms, marking the first significant shift in state politics since 2016 nationwide when Democrats took control of both houses and secured three U.S Senate seats—a monumental victory for progressives at that time.

According to a Pew Research Center analysis released earlier this year based on data from Edison, Texas is projected as having between six to seven million eligible voters by the end of next November's midterms; however, only about 10% participate in off-year elections. Notably, there are over two million Texans living with a felony conviction that may affect future redistricting if this year’s turnout aligns with Pew and Edison projections of up to five percentage points higher than usual (an increase from roughly 7% to about 12%).

"It's unprecedented in Texas, but the numbers suggest a trend towards more inclusivity," says Dr. Maria Hernandez, political scientist at Rice University and co-author of 'The New Texans: An Exploration'. "In districts that have notoriously leaned Republican for years now may find themselves with new faces."

Potential redistricting plans could see several congressional seats flipping to Democratic control, a development likely driven by higher engagement from traditionally underrepresented communities. This includes Texas's growing Latino population and urban areas that have been historically marginalized or overlooked in past political landscapes—groups who often favor Democrats more strongly than Republicans due largely to social issues like immigration policies which tend to align with the Democratic platform, as well their support for healthcare reforms such as Medicaid expansion under President Biden's administration.

However, many Texas Republican officials remain confident that despite high turnout projections nationwide—with more than 180 million eligible voters in U.S elections compared to about two hundred and thirty-one million state ballots cast annually within Texas alone —Republicans still have a chance at victory come November if they can manage their campaigns effectively, said John Smithson, Chairman of the Houston County Republican Party during an interview with CNN this weekend.

"It's not enough to merely raise awareness among disenfranchised communities; we need to ensure our message reaches them as well," he stated. "Trust and familiarity are essential in building a strong base."
