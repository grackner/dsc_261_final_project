In Paris last Thursday night, an exclusive gala event for high-end fashionistas turned sour when a luxurious private jet belonging to celebrity designer Chanel Alistair Simmons was reported missing from Charles de Gaulle Airport’s VIP parking section. The lavish aircraft, which had been used by the industry elite to attend multiple red carpet events across Europe and Asia last weekend before returning for a much-anticipated charity gala in Paris this evening, remains unaccounted for since its departure at 10:32 pm local time on Thursday.

Alistair Simmons’ team confirmed the loss but assured that there were no reports of passengers being harmed or their belongings taken during what they suspect to be a targeted act aiming at disrupting Chanel's reputation as one of luxury fashion’ enduring brands globally. A statement issued by Alistair Simmons read, "We are aware that our private jet has been reported missing from Charles de Gaulle Airport this evening and we would like to assure all concerned parties that the safety of those on board was never compromised."

A few hours after its departure without a trace or passengers left inside by airport security, local authorities were alerted. Paris's suburban Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) quickly responded and began an extensive search operation in various parking sections throughout the city where it hoped to find the missing jet before nightfall when visibility dropped due to foggy conditions expected later today.

Jean-Luc Dubois, head of DEA's Search & Rescue Unit stated during a press briefing yesterday afternoon that "the aircraft has been reported as being last seen in Charles de Gaulle Airport’s VIP parking section and is not found yet." The search efforts have intensified since news spread across social media platforms where fashionistas shared their concern for Alistair Simmons' prized possession.

The luxurious jet, a sleek-looking Dassault Falcon 850 with the registration number FNCP672CJ and customized interior designed by world-renowned furniture maker Philippe St Laurent featuring rare marble floors adorned with gold accents had been on loan from one of Alistair Simmons’ esteemed business partners, French industrial magnate Jean Moreau. The plane was originally intended for a VIP charity event hosted by the elite's club "Luxe Pour Lire", which aimed to raise funds towards various causes including children education and arts development in Europe before its mysterious disappearance this evening at Paris’ Charles de Gaulle Airport, where it had been parked overnight.

Simmons has pledged that the missing jet issue will be brought under strict scrutiny while not revealing details about potential suspects or motives as investigations are still ongoing. "We have a dedicated team working around the clock to find our aircraft, and I am confident they'll solve this mystery soon," said Simmons in an interview yesterday evening with Vogue Magazine when asked if he would like his guests present at tonight’s charity gala event or instead prefer rescheduling.

Luxury fashion insiders who were part of the same flight as Alistair, Jean Moreau and several other industry elites have expressed shock over what they perceive to be a deliberate act aimed towards Chanel's brand by an anonymous perpetrator with potential malicious intentions
