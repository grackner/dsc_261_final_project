A massive snowstorm expected to hit Beijing on Saturday could disrupt Olympic preparations as temperatures plummet and visibility drops dramatically ahead of the opening ceremony next week. The National Meteorological Center has forecasted upwards of six feet (1.8 meters) worth of heavy, wet snow across parts of North China by early Sunday morning.

Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics organizers were already battling extreme cold as they prepared for the event set to begin on February 4th and run through February 20th next year at venues within a two-hour commute from downtin Beijing, including in Zhangjiakou city. The snowstorm comes amid concerns about environmental sustainability surrounding this Olympic edition which will use mostly temporary facilities to host the events with minimal impact on natural sites and wildlife.

Olympic volunteer coordinator Liu Wei said that all preparations would continue despite the forecast, but cautioned athletes not to take unnecessary risks if they head out into snowfall during their travels for competitions or practices. "We understand this could potentially interrupt some events' schedules," he commented on Tuesday evening (February 25th).

Snowstorm warnings have already led authorities across North China to declare holidays early, with most schools and businesses shut down until February 29th. Officials in Beijing said they would monitor the situation closely but had no immediate plan for evacuation or shelter arrangements as of Wednesday (February 26th).

The Olympic torch relay has already begun, with runners traversing cities and towns across China to symbolize hope amid adversity. This year's route includes Zhangjiakou city - known for its scenic landscapes and traditional culture. The Beijing Organizing Committee Chairman Wang Junsheng said on Thursday that "Our resilient athletes will continue pushing forward despite the snowfall."

"We encourage citizens to take care of their safety," he added, noting emergency services were prepared for such situations and urging people nevertheless. The torch relay continues through February 27th before it enters Beijing at Tongxia Stadium on March 1st during the opening ceremony's final segment - a moment when world attention is focused squarely upon China as nations unite to celebrate sportsmanship and shared aspirations.

Olympic ice hockey coach Chen Qiang said that despite concerns about travel conditions, he planned for players in his team based out of Zhangjiakou city's Ice Cage Arena & Training Center not to let the snow dampen their spirit: "No matter how cold or dark it gets, we will come together as a family and make our way forward."

Experts have noted that such extreme weather events may become more frequent in coming years due to climate change. Environmental scientist Zhang Wei at Tsinghua University says that while this storm was highly unusual for Beijing's winter, "Climate models suggest we could see similar disru05194_story
