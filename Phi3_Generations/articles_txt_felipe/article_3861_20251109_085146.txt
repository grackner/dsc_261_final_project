In a groundbredependent study announced today by scientists at Harvard University's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences in Boston, an international team has developed a new type of solar cell that harnesses energy from artificial light sources with unprecedented efficiency rates reaching as high as 35%. This revolutionary technology could transform the way we power our lives by enabling smaller-scale, indoor photovoltaic systems.

Harvard engineers have pioneered this advance in solar cell research for over five years before announcing their results today at a press conference held on Harvard's main campus and simultaneously live streaming online events to invite global attention into the field of energy science. The scientists explained that unlike traditional silicon-based photovoltaic cells which primarily work by absorbing sunlight, this cutting-edge solar cell technology can convert artificial light – produced through fluorescent lamps or LED bulbs - efficiently backed up with electrodes and insulating materials into usable energy.

Dr. Jane Smith, the lead researcher of the project said in a statement at today's press conference: "Our findings represent an essential leap forward to sustainability by breaking down barriers for indoor solar power use." She continued saying that although traditional silicon-based cells are limited when it comes to converting sunlight into electricity due to their size and weight, this new technology could pave the way toward integrating photovoltaic systems in various smaller applications such as cell phones or tablets.

While conventional solar panels require direct exposure from outside sources of light- often making use only feasible during daylight hours - these artificially lit cells can convert indoor electricity back into energy, which could make the technology more appealing for widespread adoption in areas where sunlight is scarce. In addition to that this discovery also presents an alternative way forward toward renewable and clean sources of power generation globally as cities evolve towards a carbon-neutral future by reducing their reliance on conventional electricity grids fueled predominantly with fossil fuels like coal, oil or gas plants for lighting purposes.

Professor John Doe from MIT's Solar Energy Research Institute was quoted saying during an interview at today’s press conference: "The research results presented by Harvard are truly remarkable and I am excited to learn more about this potential energy-harvesting system." The professor, a leading authority on solar cell technology studies shared his insights adding that there will be numerous practical considerations before the new findings can become widely adopted. He emphasized factors like cost efficiency of manufacturing these cells in large volumes and maintain their durability over time despite being less expensive than traditional silicon-based photovoltaic systems on a per-watt basis.

As for next steps, researchers plan to improve upon the technology through iterative testing at various light sources before moving forward with human trials or commercial applications of this indoor solar cell system in different settings like homes and offices worldwide. This innovation could bring us one step closer toward achieving a sustainable energy future by expanding accessibility for individuals seeking alternative, renewable ways to power their devices on the go - even when stuck at home working or studying during night hours away from sunlight availability due to weather constraints and geographical locations.

In conclusion, researchers hope that this novel solar cell technology will eventually lead to a greener world by offering an indoor alternative for harnessing energy more efficiently as the planet strives towards carbon neutral
