Houston Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson has been placed on administrative leave by the NFL following a second offensive allegation made public last Friday evening in New York City, reports CNN's Andy Reid and Ivy Barnett from Houston. The incident occurred during an exhibition match between two high school teams at Memorial Stadium here on Thursday night when 17-year-deceit accused Watson of touching him without consent while he had a knee down on the ground, as per multiple eyewitness accounts and video evidence available to the public. This latest development comes after another former player filed similar claims in May at his high school alma mater where there is no question that these matters have become front-page news here for days now with 27% of parents supporting Watson's allegations, according to a recent poll conducted by Rasmussen Reports and televised on local NBC affiliate KTRK.

The Houston Texans organization expressed their concern about the situation following an investigation from multiple sources at both schools involved in this incident as well as NFL personnel investigators who were called into action due to his status within the league, a statement released by team management read: "Our priority is ensuring player safety and maintaining integrity on our field. We are closely monitoring developments herein while also working with local authorities and school officials." Officials from the New York City School District (NYCSD) were likewise quick to comment, stating they will cooperate fully in investigating these claims: "It's unacceptable for anything of this nature to occur on our property. We are committed to conducting a thorough and fair examination."

Watson has always had an impressive career as one of the best quarterback prospects since entering college football after graduation from Alabama, where he led his team in passing efficiency by 28% over second place finisher Jalen Hurts during their three years together. His prowess was not lost on NFL scouts who selected him for the Texans as soon as available at pick number two36 overall back in May 2019, an auspicious start to his professional career that would eventually lead Houston onto first place finishes within divisional standings multiple seasons. Watson had also been named AFC Offensive Player of the Year twice straight before this latest allegation surfaced but has since taken a hiatus from playing as all parties investigate these charges, reports ESPN's Michael Smith and Ashley Harris here in Houston on Monday morning: "It is disheartening to see such claims being made against me; however my character remains untarnished," Watson said during an interview at his home near the Meyerland neighborhood last evening.

According to friends, family members who worked with him throughout college football and professional tenure shared that he was a dedicated teammate without issue before this latest incident: "Watson has always been one of my closest pals off-field as well; I never once saw anything remotely inappropriate between us," former Alabama wide receiver Jaylen Smith, who now plays for the Baltimore Ravens told Reid and Barnett at his current residence. This latest allegation against Watson is not an isolated case within professional football – similar accusations have been made toward several other players across different positions including a few notable names such as Kyle Shanahan (Head Coach of the Atlanta Falcons), Tua Tagovailoa, and Matt Ryan among others since 2018. In fact NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell announced an
