In a historic move that has stirred international attention and concern in Washington DC yesterday afternoon, Palestinian teenager Ahmad Eid was fatally shot near Al-Aqsa Mosque during an escalating protest against Israeli occupation policies across the Gaza Strip. Witnesses reported hearing gunshots as tensions between Israelis and Palestinians in the region have risennent, with numerous peace efforts failing to make progress over decades of conflict.

"It was such a senseless act," said one eyewitness who braved running into an area cordoned off by Israeli forces since last week's violent clashes near Gaza City that claimed the lives of at least three Palestinians, including two children aged 10 and 8. "It seems like every time we get close to a breakthrough in negotiations, another tragedy occurs."

According to local media reports based on statements from family members and friends near Eid's residence inside the Gaza Strip’s refugee camps where most Palestinians live since 1948 when Israeli forces took control of East Jerusalem. Witnesses say he had been partying in nearby Al-Bustan, a popular nightlife spot frequented by many young people who believe that they will die someday fighting for liberation from the occupation or as collateral damage during clashes between Israelis and Palestinians at checkpoints near Jerusalem.

As Eid's parents rushed him to an area hospital following news of his death, reports emerged on social media showing police vehicles speeding towards them with sirens blaring while they were still in their car discussing funeral arrangements when officers stormed inside shouting orders about what would happen next. Official statements from Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas condemned the shooting as a "horrifying incident," and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued an order for military investigations into allegations that his forces killed Eid, though he denied responsibility by claiming it was likely carried out by terrorists linked to Hamas who control parts of Gaza Strip.

Six hours after the shooting took place near Al-Aqsa Mosque and Dung Gate on Jabotinsky Street in Jerusalem's Old City at about 3pm local time, protesters have already begun demonstrating outside Israeli embassies across Europe with demands that Eid’s killer be brought to justice.

Palestine Solidarity Movement activist Omar Al-Qaddum expressed the feeling of anger and sorrow shared by many Palestinians worldwide in a tweet: "The shooting death of our beloved brother Ahmad, just 16 years old - today we lost more than one soul. This senseless act can no longer be tolerated."

Meanwhile inside Gaza City, protesters are demanding Eid's killer face justice for what they believe was an unprovoked attack meant to instill fear among Palestinians who continue their resistance against Israeli occupation policies even if it comes with the cost of lives lost. In a brief statement issued by Hamas spokesperson Iyad al-Ghouti, he emphasized that "this tragedy has not weakened our struggle" and called for unity among Palestinians to stand strong against external forces aiming at dividing them through violence:

Experts believe this incident will further escalate the already
