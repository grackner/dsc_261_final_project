A fire erupted at a youth soccer camp in Atlanta on Saturday morning, July 15th, leading to multiple injuries but thankfully leaving all players and staff unharmed outside of the blaze's immediate damage. Firefigdisplaced nearly six dozen boys ages eight through thirteen attending Camp Champion Spirit Academy located at Pine Forest Park in Atlanta’s Eastside neighborhood when smoke alarms went off just before 9am, Georgia local time.

The camp director, David Richardson, told CNN that the cause of the fire is still under investigation but mentioned witnesses' accounts about electrical issues prior to the blaze: “We noticed some flickering lights and heard buzzing sounds from our equipment earlier in the morning before everything went downhill,” he explained.

An Atlanta Fire Department spokesperson confirmed their crew arrived within minutes of receiving a call at 8:57am but was unable to access all areas immediately due to smoke obstruction, delaying extinguishment for an hour-and-a-half before they were able to fully control the situation.

“It’s unfortunate that this happened during one of our most successful seasons in decades,” shared retired professional soccer player turned camp coach Alex Monroe about the Camp Champion Spirit Academy's recent accomplishments under his guidance, “But we are resilient and won't let a fire dampen our spirits.”

The Atlanta Fire Department’s Chief Engineer James Smith added to CNN that safety checks would be implemented throughout city-operated camps in light of the incident. "We take incidents like this very seriously," he told reporters onsite at Camp Champion Spirit Academy, “Ensuring we maintain stringent fire prevention standards is a top priority moving forward.”

Campers and staff are already planning how they can make soccer camp better than ever next season. "Our boys have shown incredible strength in these trying times,” said Monroe to the Daily Mail about his team of kids who helped extinguish small fires before professionals arrived on scene, “We’re a family here at Camp Champion Spirit Academy and we stick together through thick or thin.”
