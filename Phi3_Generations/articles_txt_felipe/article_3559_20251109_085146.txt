Heavy snowfall blankets Washington D.C., causing flight delays and school closings as a winter storm system approaches; meteorologists warn of up to two feet in some areas by Tuesday evening. The National Weather Service (NWS) has issued blizzard warnings for the region, urging residents to avoid travel if possible.

Experts at the nearby Federal Storm Research Center explain that "the combination of cold arctic air and warm moist air from a developing low-pressure system over the Atlantic is creating ideal conditions for snowfall." The storm's trajectory suggests it could bring heavy, wet snow to parts of New England by early next week.

School districts across D.C., Maryland, and Virginia have already announced closings or delays as officials prepare response plans. At Reagan National Airport on Saturday morning, 26 flights had been canceled due to the weather conditions; however, airport operations director Janet Smith assured that "we are doing everything possible under these circumstances."

In Boston this weekend alone, over five inches of snow has already fallen in some areas. The city's transportation department is keeping an eye on road and transit service disruiners to ensure the safety for commuters; a statement released from the office reads that "we understand how inconvenient these conditions may be."

Residents across New York City have been dealing with similar weather challenges. In Queens, snow plows are working around-the-clock keeping major roads clear of any build-ups due to recent heavy rains and flooding caused by the remnants from Hurricane Ida last weekend; an official statement issued yesterday said "we have been prepared for this storm since it was first reported, we urge residents not travel until conditions improve."

Local meteorologists continue monitoring developments as they update warnings to reflect current information. They advise caution and preparation while stressing that the worst could still be ahead of us; a statement from Dr. Robert Miller at Washington University's Department of Meteorology states, "With any winter storm comes risks - let’s not underestimate them."

In response to these developments, city officials are urging residents and businesses in affected areas to remain alert while providing regular updates on weather conditions through their respective emergency management agencies. 

Public health experts recommend people stay indoors as much as possible during the storm; a statement released by Dr. Sarah Thompson at Johns Hopkins University warned that "extreme cold and snow can pose serious risks to vulnerable populations, especially those with pre-existing conditions." Officials advise all individuals who need emergency medical attention or assistance to call 911 immediately if they feel the effects of the extreme weather.

The storm is expected to pass on Sunday evening; however, officials are still advising residents across impacted areas not to travel until after that period as winter conditions persist throughout Monday and Tuesday into Wednesday morning before snow clears in most parts by early next weekend; an official statement released yesterday from Mayor Muriel Bowser's office read "we remain vigilant about ensuring the safety of our city’s citizens while we navigate this storm together."

As they reassess damage and prepare plans for cleanup efforts, officials in Washington D.C., New York City, Boston, as well other affected regions are encouraging residents to stay safe by following advice from local weather forecasts; a statement issued on Saturday morning at the National Weather Service
