A fire broke out in a historic East London pub last night, causing significant damage but luckily leaving no injuries reported among patrons and staff according to reports by local authorities on June 5th. The bustling Water Lane Arms Pub at the heart of Bethnal Green was engulfed in flames around midnight after an electrical fault sparked a blaze that quickly spread through piled newspapers stored above bar, officials said today.

The cozy establishment known for its live music nights and traditional British fare had packed on Monday evening ahead to celebrate the upcoming World Cup final match between England and Croatia taking place in Saudi Arabia later this weekend. Witnesses say thick black smoke billowed out of an upper floor around 12:30 am, as patrons inside were startled by a sudden power cut that followed shortly after within minutes - before the fire started spreading throughout Water Lane Arms and engulfed several rooms on multiple floors with little time for evacuation.

"It was terrifying," said regular customer Sarah Parker (not her real name). "I thought our favorite pub had gone up in flames when I saw that smoke coming out from above - we quickly tried to help the staff and patrons get outside." 

Firefigdependent London Fire Brigade attended shortly after they were called at around midnight. The team worked tirelessly throughout most of yesterday combating an aggressive blaze, but their efforts led them today when fire chiefs declared victory - however with a significant loss in the historic pub's character and interior that will now require repairs before it can reopen to customers again under its new lease.

The local council has pledged more than £20,000 towards restoring Water Lane Arms while they await further funding options from insurance providers for the remaining estimated damages which could top $35,000 according to proprietor Tom Harrison who told reporters yesterday his business was lucky enough not suffer any structural damage.

"It's going to be a long road ahead," said Mr Harrison (not real name) while looking out at the charred remains from inside an empty pub and bar on June 8th, surrounded by emergency services vehicles parked outside as they pack up after fighting off what he called one of his worst nightmares - but with hope for a brighter future ahead. "We have been here almost three decades running this place like it was our second home since the day we opened; I am determined to rebuild everything back from scratch once again."

His sentiment appears shared by locals who've already begun gathering outside Water Lane Arms, reminiscing with each other and offering their support as they come together in solidarsity during a tough time for the community - while also eager to get updates about when it will be safe again inside once repairs are completed.

"I've always loved this place," said regular customer Emily Taylor (not her real name), wiping away tears as she spoke on June 8th outside Water Lane Arms, "And I don't know if things can ever go back to normal for us after what happened but we must stand united now and support Tom through this time like he has supported all of ours."

Emergency services officials will visit later today in an ongoing assessment process with the building owner, who is expected by tomorrow's deadline from insurance providers to provide a final
