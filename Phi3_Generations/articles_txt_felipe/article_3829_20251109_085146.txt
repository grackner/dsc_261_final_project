A recent culinary trend sweeping across Europe has brought an exotic flavor profile to traditional French dishes at a historic Lyon restaurant renowned for its patisserie and rich sauces: Vietnamese pho-inspired choucroute with lemongrass infused broth. The establishment, 50 years old and known as Chez Bénédicte on Rue des Lônes in the heart of the city's gastronomic quarter, unveiled its new menu last Friday evening amid much anticipation from food enthusiast endorsements by local celebrity chef Alain Passard.

Chef Pierre Duval has taken a bold step to fuse Southeast Asian and French cuisine at his Lyon eatery, creating "La Pharmène", which is described as 'a symphony of flavors where the umami meets citrus notes.' The restaurant's owners were inspired by their trip to Hanoi last year. Passard shares about this unique offering in an interview saying,"It was a beautiful journey that ignited Pierre’s creativity and passion for experimenting with fusion cuisine."

In the past, choucroute had been served as a simple yet comforting dish consisting of ham or sausage-packed cabbage leaves cooked to perfection. In contrast, Chez Bénédicte's version has transformed into an adventurous combination where each bite reveals notes reminiscent of lemongrass and ginger alongside the familiar tanginess from pickled vegetables traditionally found in choucroute dishes – a twist that is proving to be quite popular with diners, who are lining up for table reservations since last Tuesday.

The owners decided on this fusion after noticing their patrons' growing curiosity about international flavors at Chez Bénédicte’s signature dishes and an interest in trying authentic Vietnamese pho from one of Lyon's many acclaimed Pho establishments, as noted by frequent diner Marie-Claire Dubois. “The choucroute was my favorite part,” she said during a recent meal where Chef Duval showcased this innovative dish for the first time to their regular clientele – an audience that has long waited eagerly in line at his doorstep every Thursday evening as he prepares each course with love and attention.

Chef Pierre himself explains, "I wanted something familiar yet unexpected enough to surprise our guests who have grown used to French fare." The fusion of flavors reflects both respect for the heritage ingredients that form choucroute's backbone - pork, onions, mustard seeds – and an appreciation of Vietnamese culinary traditions. It is a testament not only to Chez Bénédicte’s commitment as pioneers in their locale but also represents Lyon itself; the city that continues its reputation for openness towards blending cultural influences while honoring local gastronomical identities and celebrating diversity through food experiences.

Critics, including well-known culinary journalist Claude Lefevre, have praised Chef Pierre's creative approach in incorporating new ideas into Lyon’s classic dishes with comments like: “Fusion cuisine takes courage; it is not without risks and challenges." He further adds that "Choucroute meets pho at a crossroads of culture, where taste sensations emerge as delightful
