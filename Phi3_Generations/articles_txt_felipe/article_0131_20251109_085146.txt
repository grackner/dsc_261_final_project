John Carter, celebrated actor and environmental activist known for his leading role in blockbuster movies like "Epic Journeys" released last year, has made a surprising announcement about stepping down from acting to focus on climate change initiatives full-time starting next month. He will continue with advocacy work but officially retires as an actor at the age of 47 after over two decades in Hollywood.


Carter's decision comes amid growing concern regarding environmental issues, and his voice has become increasingly significant within both the entertainment industry and public discourse. His announcement shocked many fans who have come to expect not just action on-screen but also off it from their favorite movie star.


A representative for John Carter said in a statement: "John is passionate about his work, whether that's telling compelling stories or making real change for our planet." In an exclusive interview with The Hollywood Reporter backstage at the Sundance Film Festival yesterday afternoon, he explained why this was not just career choice but also personal conviction.


"I saw first-hand how quickly things are changing," Carter said while reflecting on his recent film project "Epic Journeys", which took him to several endangered rainforest locations worldwide for the movie shoot last year. “We need urgent action, and it feels like now is my time.”

 
The next phase of John's work will include a collaboration with NGO Green World Alliance on their upcoming campaign "Save Earth". In an emotional statement to fans via social media: "I won’t be playing roles any longer. I want the world in our stories, not just my own." He added that he was determined to use his platform and resources for this cause moving forward.

 
Celebrity influencers like Emma Watson, Leonardo DiCaprio have recently joined similar causes but Carter's announcement is notable because of his fame amongst younger generations through the hit series "Tomorrowland", which has shaped their views on societal issues for years now – including climate change. The news was met with mixed reactions from fans and industry experts alike, some expressing admiration while others fear a loss in popular culture's richness without his unique acting flair.

 
John Carter’s announcement has brought the conversation about balancing celebrity activism vs career life to light more than ever before this season of Hollywood. As for John himself: "This is my way forward - I feel it aligns with who I am and what's important."
