A high-stakes investment deal worth billions has been signed between two global technology giants this week in Silicon Valley. On Thursday morning, Apple Inc., known for its innovative consumer electronics and software products, entered into a lucrative partnership with Saudi Arabia'selknew venture capital firm ACV Technology Holding Company Ltd.' to invest $25 billion over the next five years in Riyadh.

Amid growing concerns about diversifying its economy away from oil dependence, this deal is seen as a major push for King Salman and his Vision 2030 plan aimed at transforming Saudi Arabia into an international technology hub by developing cutting-edge tech companies within the country's borders. This investment will focus on fostering innovation in areas such as artificial intelligence, robotics, renewable energy sources among others that have been identified as potential growth sectors for the Middle Eastern nation to expand its economy while reducing reliance on oil production and exportation of petroleum resources - a commodity that forms over 90% of Saudi Arabia's total exports.

"I am very confident in this partnership between Apple Inc. and ACV, as it will bring together the best minds from both countries to push boundaries on innovative technologies," said Abdulaziz Al-Awami, CEO at ACV Technology Holding Company Ltd., adding that "We hope our venture into developing these industries in Saudi Arabia can contribute greatly towards a more diverse and robust economy."

Both parties have announced plans for extensive investments across multiple sectors of the country's burgeoning technology industry, with ACV Technology holding around 50% ownership. This deal follows Apple's previous $1 billion partnership last year to develop self-driving car technologies through Lyft Inc., its ride sharing partner in North America; and a similar investment made by Microsoft Corporation into Indian ecommerce giant Flipkart Pvt Ltd, which was acquired later on.

Experts believe that this venture could potentially reshape the economic landscape of Saudi Arabia for years to come as well provide numerous job opportunities in Silicon Valley's technology hub and abroad by attracting top talent from across multiple disciplines working towards developing these new industries within Riyadh.

"It is exciting news that such a significant investment has been made between Apple Inc., one of the most successful tech companies worldwide, and Saudi Arabia's ACV Technology Holding Company Ltd.. It shows confidence in our country’s future growth," said Fahd Al-Mousaid, Minister for Cabinet Affairs at Riyadh.

This investment comes amid growing global efforts to develop a greener economy by reducing carbon emissions and developing alternative energy sources such as solar panels & wind turbines – two sectors where Saudi Arabia has already been making significant strides due to its abundant sunlight throughout the year in addition to vast expanses of unused desert land suitable for large-scale industrial projects.

"With this investment, we will be able not only diversify our economy but also promote innovation and create opportunities that would benefit generations after us," said Salman Al-Farisil, Minister at the Saudi Ministry of Energy in Riyadh who oversees development efforts focused on renewable energy sources.

This partnership has been hailed as a significant milestone for
