In a stunning upset at Saturday's college football game between Florida State and Alabama Crimson Tide on campus in Tallahassee, FSU pulled off an improbable victory with less than four minutes left to play when their last-ditch field goal attempt paid off. This unexpected triumph propelled the Seminoles into a spot atop Group E of Conference USA's standings as they entered Week 8 under new coach Jimbo Fisher, marking his second season in Tallahassee with back-to-back conference wins for FSU since returning to play football against Florida State.

Florida State quarterback Jalen Miles threw an interception that led directly into the hands of Crimson Tide cornerback James Allen at just 5:12 remaining, setting up a short field and paving the way for junior kicker Tyler Jones to make his mark on history. "I couldn't believe it when I saw the ball hit the upright," said senior defensive end Ryan Smith in an interview with ESPN afterward.

As the dust settles on this nail-biting game that brought back vivid memories from FSU's last championship win in 2014, fans of both teams are reflecting and relishing over a night they won't soon forget. In an incredible reversal, Alabama lost for the first time since November 5th (DailyMail).

With just one game remaining before their season finale on October 27th against top-ranked LSU at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta and a chance to clinch homecoming with victory over FSU on Saturday, Alabama coach Nick Sinex remains confident his team can reclaim the championship title they lost earlier this year.

"We have overcome so much adversity throughout our season," said senior linebacker Jake Taylor while practicing before yesterday's game (ESPN). "This loss has only strengthened us, and we will come back stronger."* 

In a statement to the Tallahassee Tribune later that evening. FSU coach Jimbo Fisher echoed those sentiments: “We have had some bad luck this season but today's win proves there’s no limit when it comes to hard work, perseverance and unity in our program.”* 

Several players from both sides of the ball were quick to praise their teammates for pulling together under pressure. Sophomore running back David Carter said that seeing his Crimson Tide opponents stand strong after an interception was inspiring, while senior receiver Tommy Smith acknowledged FSU's resilience: “I thought it took a lot of guts to come out in the fourth quarter and fight like they did."

With Alabama now seeking redemption at home on Saturday against Ole Miss Rebels before heading to Baton Rouge for their season finale, both teams will have much on which to reflect. Whether FSU continues this momentum or if Sinex can deliver a victory that keeps his team's hopes alive remains yet uncertain as the SEC and CUSA prepare for an exciting matchup ahead in November (NBC Sports).
