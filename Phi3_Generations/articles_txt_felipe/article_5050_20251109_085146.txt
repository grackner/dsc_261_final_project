A recent study conducted in New York City revealed that half of American adults are not physically active enough to reap significant health benefits from exercise and may even be at risk for premature death due to lack of physical activity, according to researchers with the CUNY School of Medicine. Experts analyzed data collected over a 10-year period involving more than three million American adults aged between 20 and 85 who participated in health surveys conducted by federal agencies such as CDC (Centers for Disease Control) from across the country, with findings published on Wednesday.

Researchers found that despite public awareness campaigns promoting physical activity benefits like reduced risks of chronic diseases and improved mental health, only 52% participated in at least one hour'thourly exercise sessions per week—considered the threshold for achieving significant cardiovascular improvements. The alarming results emphasized that insufficient movement not only impacts individual well-being but also places a burden on healthcare systems nationwide due to increased chronic disease prevalence and higher treatment costs.

"The fact is, we've invested billions in physical activity campaigns over the last two decades with little tangible progress," says lead researcher Dr. Lisa Martin at CUNY School of Medicine. "It appears that many Americans struggle to prioritize or even manage their time for exercise amidst a busy lifestyle."

One participant, 35-year-old Emily Thompson from Queens shared her thoughts about physical inactivity: “I understand the importance of staying active and maintain healthy habits. However, work commitments often get in the way.” Many other survey participants echoed similar experiences with their hectic schedules as primary reasons for low exercise frequency.

"Our findings are alarming," Dr. Martin says. "Physical activity has been shown to significantly improve overall health and reduce chronic disease risks, yet we see half of our population not engaging in even minimal daily movement." She added that these results suggest a need for urgent action on public policy levels as well.

“We must look into better ways of promoting physical activity amongst Americans," suggests Dr. Martin. "This includes developing accessible exercise facilities, creating safe outdoor spaces for people to engage in recreational activities and making workplaces more physically active-friendly." She notes that further research should also explore the role genetics may play on an individual's propensity towards physical activity levels as well.

"Physical education programs need revitalizing too," says Dr. Sarah Patel, a fitness expert and adjunct professor at Columbia University Medical School who contributed to this study. "We must teach children the importance of being active from a young age." She also advocates for incorporating workout breaks into standard office schedules as an easy way to encourage physical activity during long hours spent sitting in front of computer screens.

In conclusion, while awareness around health benefits due to exercise has been increasing over time across the U.S., a significant portion remains sedentary with dire implications for both individual and national well-being levels. Dr. Martin believes that these findings should be taken as an urgent call-to-action by policymakers, employers, families to create more opportunities and motivations for individuals of all ages and backgrounds to lead active lifestyles in this fast-paced modern world.
