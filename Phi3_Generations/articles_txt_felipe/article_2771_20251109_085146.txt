A new comet expected to pass close enough for stunning views visible from Earth was discovered last month by amateur astronomer Jim Webb in his backyard observatory located near Flagstaff, Arizona. The object, named Comet Kempner-Webb after its discoverers, is projected to make an exceptional appearance at the Southern Hemisphere's summer solstice on December 21 when it will approach within a lunar distance of Earth for just over four nights before moving out into deep space once more.

The comet discovery was made possible by advanced telescopes and software that allow non-professional astronomers to contribute significantly to science, as Webb pointed his own backyard setup towards the sky at 3 AM on a crisp November evening when he spotted an unfamiliar point of light moving against the starry background. "I had been studying charts for comet activity in our region and nothing caught my attention until I looked through my telescope that night," says Webb, who has since joined forces with professional astronomers to map out its pathway more accurately using data from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope among others.

Astronomy enthusiast Laura Martinez watched as Comet Kempner-Webb became visible through her telescope in Argentina on December 20 and notes that "it was unlike anything I had seen before - the tail glowed brilliantly against a dark backdrop." According to predictions by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), this comet will pass Earth at speeds up to 14.5 kilometers per second, making it one of the fastest objects in our solar system as seen from home turf when skywatchers gaze upon its fleeting passage across Ursa Major just after sunset during December solstice nights for a brief window lasting until January 20th before continuing on into interstellar space beyond Neptune'thy orbit.

"Observing comets is rare and never seen twice in one lifetime," says Dr. Susan Owens, chief astronomer at the European Southern Observatory (ESO) who has witnessed numerous passages of heavenly bodies over her career but adds "Comet Kempner-Webb's journey through our inner solar system offers an exciting chance for people around here to step outside and gaze up in wonder."

Experts believe that Comet Kempner-Webb may shed light on fundamental questions about comets themselves as they interact with the Sun. Dr. Robert Zhang, a prominent astrophysicist at Caltech who specializes studying small bodies of our solar system shared insight into why this opportunity is unique and important for science: "Though we've studied many similar objects before passing relatively close to Earth-orbiting spacecraft like Voyager or New Horizons, never have they given us such an ideal chance at observing them upclose. This once in a lifetime event could help answer questions about their origins and evolution since the dawn of our solar system."

Observatories worldwide are preparing for this rare opportunity to catch sight on Earth's atmosphere including several located here where local residents, scientists alike eagerly await Comet Kempner-Webb's arrival. For Martinez in her homeland country Argentina, she says "Being able to see such a spectacular and unique object that only happens once every few millennia makes me realize how vast the universe truly is."
