A popular TV show has announced a surprising twist to its latest season finale episode airing last night at 9 PM ET on NBC Universal's "Glam Life." The highly anticipated series concluded with an unexpected character death, which shocked viewers nationwide. During the dramatic cliffhanger scene set in Los Angeles, main actress Emily Stone was suddenly not seen as a guest star after weeks of speculation regarding her fate onscreen.

According to behind-theinsterrety cameras during filming at Sony Pictures Studios between March 1 and April 52nd, production designer Marcus Young orchestrated the scene that left audiences heartbroken overnight as he removed actress Emily Stone from one of her favorite sets. The absence was confirmed by NBC Universal reporters just before airtime while promoting their upcoming season premiere on March 14th in New York City's Times Square, where fans gathered to bid farewell and celebrate the show that had captivated millions since its debut episode aired five years ago.

"I knew things might change for some of my favorite characters after so many seasons," shared lead actor Daniel Harris with CNN Entertainment as he addressed concerns surrounding Stone's sudden disappearance from set which has left fans divided over whether the actress is leaving voluntarily or if she was pushed out due to creative differences. Some viewers believe that producer James Smith may have influenced her exit, but no official confirmation regarding this rumor had surfaced before yesterday evening when news broke of Emily Stone's departure from "Glam Life."

Critics argue whether the showrunners intentionally engineered such a heartbreaking moment for ratings spikes or if it was an unfortunate misstep that disregarded fans' sentiments who have become invested in these beloved characters. Despite initial panic and disappointment, some loyal viewers admit they may continue watching through to see how their favorite stars handle this significant change on screen while hoping for a happy reunion next season despite the uncertainty regarding Stone’s return or replacement character if required due her departure from "Glam Life."

CNN Entertainment reporters spoke with Emily's former co-star, Rachel Green about what happened and why she felt so strongly compelled to step back. She said: "I always had a mutual respect for my fellow actors on set but there were some creative differences between myself & producer James Smith which made me feel uncomfortable during the last few weeks." The actress went onto say that when her character was killed, she felt like it didn't reflect how I wanted to portray Emily in real life. "I loved my role as Amanda on 'Glam Life', and after all these years working together – being a part of such an incredible journey with some truly amazing people - having that abruptly taken away from me was heartbreaking."

While the network remains tight-lipped about Emily Stone's future involvement, they plan to hold a special episode on March 12th in Los Angeles where NBC Universal executives and cast members will address fan concerns at an open forum. Critics hope this might shed some light into why she was removed from the set or if her replacement character is planned for next season should auditions be held as they did back when Emily first joined "Glam Life."
