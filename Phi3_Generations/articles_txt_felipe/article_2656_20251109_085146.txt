In a groundbreener's move that has captivated audiences worldwide, legendary director John Anderson announced on Tuesday his latest project—an ambitious film reimagining the saga of "The Great Gatsby," with an all-star cast and stunning visual effects. The movie will begin principal photography in New York City next month under its working title, which is yet to be revealed officially by Anderson or his team at RMF Studios. This cinematic undertaking has already generated a significant buzz within the film community as well as among social media users who eagerly anticipate seeing this adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic 1925 novel on the big screen.

Titled "The Glitz and Glamour," Anderson said, “I wanted to honor Fitzgerald’s legacy but also infuse it with a fresh perspective that resonates with today’s audiences." The ensemble includes acclaimed actors Ethan Hawke, Billie Lourd, Timothée Chalamet, and the late Audrey Hepburn's son Luca Dotti as Gatsby. "It feels like we are part of something bigger than ourselves," says Ophelia Rose, a young actress portraying one of Jay-G’s love interests in her debut on film after years spent refining their craft backstage with Anderson at various international festivals and workshops.

In addition to the star power brought together for this retelling set amidst iconic 1920s locales such as New York City's opulent Westchester Country Club, where Gatsby hosts his legendary parties in an effort to reclaim Daisy Buchanan’s love. "Whenever I step foot on that clubhouse lawn nowadays or any other authentic 1920s setting for this project, it's as if Fitzgerald himself is watching over me," Anderson shared during the press conference at RMF Studios in Los Angeles where he announced their latest collaboration with famed production designer Michael Goldsmith.

The director has teased that his unique spin on the story will not shy away from exploring themes of loss, nostalgia and disillusionment while showcasing stunning visuals reminiscent both to early Hollywood films where class divisions were blatantly displayed in society gatherings or parties but also through modern cinematic language with state-of-the-art CGI technology.

Critics anticipate that Anderson's direction, combined with an unconventional script crafted by Fitzgerald scholar Laura Kidd who has worked closely alongside him during numerous interviews and retrospectives over the past decade as part of her extensive research into The Great Gatsby Project – a non-fiction exploration blending literary analysis with visual storytelling inspired by this novel - will result in something entirely fresh yet nostalgic; justifying why it has been hailed amongst diehard fans and cinephiles alike as an event to look forward to for years.

However, Anderson insists that the film doesn't aim to serve up a straightforward adaptation of Fitzgerald’s work but instead offers a parallel narrative through its own characters while paying homage by highlighting certain aspects from Gatsby and his time in Westchester Country Club during one particular summer evening celebration. “I wanted viewers not only root for the original love story, or hate it as some might,” he explains further to
