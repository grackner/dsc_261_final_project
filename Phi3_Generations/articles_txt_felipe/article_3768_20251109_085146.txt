A ferry carrying over a thousand passengers capsized off the coast of Brighton yesterday morning at approximately 08:45 BST due to severe weather conditions including strong winds and rough seas. The incident occurred about 12 nautical miles from Brighton Marina when MV Coastal Voyager unexpectedly listed heavily, sending its passengers into panic as lifeboats were launched immediately by the rescue services onboard.

Authorities report that all abode are accounted for safe and secure at this time with no injuries reported to date though multiple people have been slightly drenched from entering water over their heads during evacuation efforts initiated after ferry began listing early this morning amidst rapidly changing weather conditions in the Channel.

"It was absolutely terrifying, I never experienced anything like that before," said a 40-year old British man who traveled with his family on MV Coastal Voyager from Dover Port to Brighton for their annual summer getaway which lasts usually till late August when they return back home near London. "The ship was just tilting right and left uncontrollably in the water, it felt like we were stuck between a rock and hard place."

Experts say that despite modern advancements to ferry design including safety measures for adverse weather conditions over 80% of large ships have been found vulnerable during extreme sea states. "When you get into those massive waves with winds exceeding force 9 on the Beaufort Scale, it becomes quite challenging even if a vessel is well-built," says Dr Emily Waters, maritime engineering professor at Imperial College London who specializes in ship stability and resistance during rough weather conditions.

The captain of MV Coastal Voyager has reported that he immediately called for help when the ferry began tilting heavily around 08:45 BST as per standard operating procedures onboard which is to deploy lifeboats before passengers enter water over their heads but still remains inconsolable about what led up this disaster. "There's nothing more I could have done, all safety measures in place and following proper protocol," the captain shared his thoughts after being rescued by British Coastguard boats with survivors from a small group of passengers who remained onboard until their evacuation was complete around 12:30 PM.

Ferry operators are now investigating how this incident took place, reviewing weather reports and seeking to understand if there were any warning signs that might have foreseen such an event as well as examining the ship’s maintenance records in search of potential faulty equipment or materials used during construction leading up to yesterday's disaster.

The local council has pledged immediate relief efforts on-site at Brighton Marina where all ferry passengers are gathered after their evacuation, providing hot beverages and dry clothes as well a safe temporary shelter with bedding for anyone who feels cold during the night while waiting to hear back about when they can resume travel plans.

CNN Reporter: "How do you feel now that this traumatic experience is over?" 40-year old British woman asked reporters standing by as she hugged her family members tightly together after hours of evacuation and anxious wait for the next ferry transport to Dover Port scheduled later tonight at around 21:30 BST.
"I'm just relieved that we made it out safe but I can't believe
