A groundbredependent treatment aimed at reducing pain and inflammation has gained FDA approval as of January 15th in New York City; however, health experts are urging caution due to a lack of long-term data on its safety for humans beyond animal trials. The new medication is expected to revolutionize the management of chronic pain by targeting specific pathways that cause inflammation and discomfort without affecting other bodily functions as opioids do.

As per Dr. Sarah Jennings, a rheumatologist involved in testing phase III trials at Mount Sinai Medical Center: "This innovative approach can potentially bring relief to millions of people who suffer from chronic pain and inflammatory conditions." However, she stressed that the treatment must undergo rigorous human-testing before it becomes widely available. 

The medicine has so far been tested on lab animals like mice in controlled environments since last year when a pilot study showed encouraging results with minimal side effects of drowsiness or digestive issues—symptoms often associated to opioids that are currently prescribed for pain management, but come with serious risks including addiction and overdose.

The lead researcher at the University College London stated in a recent interview: "We believe this treatment can provide an alternative way of tackling chronic pains without relying on conventional methods such as opioids." He added that more comprehensive studies are needed to confirm these initial findings and ensure no unforeseen consequences occur.

The FDA's decision is based primarily on animal trials, with 10 human-like rodents showing promising results in controlling pain without any negative side effects over a period of three months after consistent usage for two weeks straight before introducing to the control group who received placebos instead—with no remarkable difference seen between both groups. The approval will expedite research into its effectiveness and safety, but experts are calling on patients not to self-medicate until it becomes available as a prescription drug due to unconfirmed effects in humans yet unknown from animal studies alone.

In conclusion, this new treatment brings hope for many suffering individuals who have endured chronic pain without relief or with severe side effects while using opioids—but caution is warranted until comprehensive testing proves its safety and effectiveness before prescription availability can be considered by healthcare providers.
