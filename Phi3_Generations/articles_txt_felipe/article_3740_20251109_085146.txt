A massive dust storm swept across parts of northwestern China on Thursday morning, reducing visibility to a few meters in some areas and leading officials to issue urgent weather alerts for Beijing and its surrthyem as well. The National Meteorological Center reported that the sandstorm began over Inner Mongolia around 5:00 am local time (09:00 GMT), driven by high-speed winds from a cold front moving in from Siberia, forcing authorities to close several sections of expressways and cancelling some flights.

Experts say this is one of the worst dust storms seen in decades for China's northernmost regions, with temperatures expected to drop as low as -10 degrees Celsius (14 degrees Fahrenheit) during its peak impact on Friday morning and evening hours. "This weather phenomenon could potentially last up to two days," said a meteorologist from the National Meteorological Center in Beijing who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of their job within government agencies.

The storm has forced authorities across multiple provinces including Qinghai, Gansu and Ningxia to issue red alerts for extreme sandstorm conditions that will result in transportation disruptions, as well posed potential health risks due to poor air quality from the swirling dust particles. In Beijing alone, officials have shut down 164 roads across seven districts and suspended subway services between Shikumen station on Line two and Yizhuang industrial park along with other bus routes in heavily affected areas such as Haidian district until further notice based on the latest assessments made by meteorological experts.

Residents living near impacted highways have been advised to stay indoors while wearing masks against breathing dust, and children were sent back home early from schools after an hour-long meeting between local education department heads in Tongzhou city announced temporary suspension of all school activities until the storm clears.

"This is not just about inconvenience for us here; it's also a matter of public safety," said Cheng Fangwei, Deputy Mayor of Beijing’s Chaoyang district during an emergency meeting with city officials regarding this weather event on Thursday afternoon at the Municipal Affairs Bureau building.

"We are closely monitoring air quality levels and working together to ensure that people in our cities have access to clean indoor spaces where they can stay safe," he added while stressing how cooperation among municipal leaders, meteorological experts, transport officials was vital for effective crisis management during this type of situation such as these severe sandstorms which occur regularly due to the desert climate found throughout northern China.

China's national weather authorities have issued a red alert across most provinces in northwestern areas following several days long stretch that saw dusty windblown sands sweeping away large quantities grasses and crops, covering everything from roadsides covered with billowing clouds of fine-grained material. Farmers are expected to face losses worth millions as vegetation buffers around farmland suffer due to such occurrences in recent years attributed by some experts that climate change is becoming more prominent leading towards increasingly harsher weather events like this one across China and elsewhere worldwide including here where I currently am reporting from on-site after getting permission granted just 20 minutes ago compared with months earlier when it was almost impossible for foreign journalists even if they wanted to get out of the capital
