In a groundbredependent announcement today by Mayor John Doe of Venice, Italy, officials revealed plans to launch an ambitious project designed to combat water-level rise that is endangering the city's famous canal system and historic buildings. The "Safeguarding Silt" initiative will begin next spring with the aim to reinforce key areas around St. Mark’s Square against flooding by constructing new barriers over two years, according to a press release issued today at City Hall on Rialto Bridge Street where Mayor Doe made his announcement alongside environmental experts and community leaders in Venice.

The project comes after increasingly frequent 'acqua alta' (high water) episodes that have brought life-threatening floods into the heart of Italy’s tourist Mecca, threatening some 60% of St. Mark’s Square below current sea levels and damaging irreplaceable artworks in local museums which are already suffering from years of subsidence due to sinking foundations caused by excess groundwater extraction over centuries ago as well as rising seas associated with climate change, reports CNN.

“The city is proud that Venice remains a unique gem despite its battles against the waters,” Mayor Doe said in an emotionally charged speech at City Hall where he outlined how citizens and business owners have been mobilized to fight this existential threat since 2019 when flooding surpassed levels not seen for over half a century. “We are here today because we refuse to let our history be submerged by the sea.”

Earlier, environmental expert Dr. Maria Bianchi from Venice University had shared similar concerns at last month’s climate summit: "The rising Adriatic Sea and global warming threaten not just this city but all coastal cities worldwide if we do nothing about these escalating threats," she explained during her closing remarks after presenting a study showing that by 2100 sea levels could rise up to two feet above current heights with increasing intensity, severely impacting Venice’s economy and culture.

Municipal engineers unveiled designs for an extensive network of tide gates which would be positioned at critical points around St Mark's Square like the Calle delle Tesei near Ponte dell'Amoretti where visitors can already see signs warning them about water levels, alongside new pumping stations and flood barriers that will reinforce key areas vulnerable to 'marea alta.' The $30 million project is expected to be completed within two years after initial funding has been secured through government grants as well as contributions from tourists who have donated over 25% of the required funds, according to Mayor Doe.

“This initiative will show everyone that Venice stands strong together,” said business owner Giorgia Ricci during an interview yesterday at her local pasta restaurant near St Mark's Square where she has witnessed firsthand how rising waters can damage centuries-old architecture around her beloved city center while also impacting daily operations. “We are ready to contribute our efforts, talents and passion toward preserving Venice for future generations.”

Reaction on social media was positive with tourists expressing their support by posting photos holding up signs that say 'Venice Forever' as well as sharing videos of the announcement where Mayor Doe can be seen shaking hands with concerned citizens. Many have also shared images highlighting beautiful landmarks in danger including Rialto Bridge
