As reported by a Los Angeles Times exclusive interview with Hollywood actress Elizabeth Taylor on January 30th, she spoke candidly about her life and career at an intimate gathering for fans in Beverly Hills this evening. Born as Elizabeth Therese Arden de Burgh to aristocratic British parents before becoming one of the most iconic beauties of film noir, Ms. Taylor revealed many secrets previously known only within close circles of her inner circle at Studio 54 tonight.

"I've spent my entire life in front of a camera," she said with an amused smile as guests chattered excitedly around the well-lit room adorned with golden memorabilia from iconic films such as Cleopatra, Casablanca and Who'sela Won (1967). "But sometimes I wonder if it was all just a grand illusion."

Ms. Taylor is known for her stunning roles in classic Hollywood cinema alongside leading men like Richard Burton during the 50s-80s, as well as more recent films such as The Ghost Writer (2010). She credits early influence from actresses Lauren Bacall and Grace Kelly with honing what she calls "a taste for artistic perfection." As one of Hollywood's most celebrated ladies ever since her breakthrough role in Shakespearean adaptation, Antony & Cleopatra at the age 23 (1950), Elizabeth Taylor is admired today not only for extraordinary beauty but also for relentless pursuit and passion towards acting craft.

"I tried to infuse every character I played with a genuine sense of life," she said, recalling scenes from her early career filled with heartbreak as well as triumphs on screen before addressing the personal side: "Some days were difficult because fame doesn't come without its challenges—whether it was navigating my way through love or dealing with criticism." 

Throughout a lengthy chat that lasted into late night, Elizabeth Taylor opened up to longtime friends and industry insiders about her relationship struggles. She revealed she had been married four times - three times simultaneously: first marriage between Richard Burton in November of '57 until May of '62; then with co-star Laurence Harvey from December 1964 till January 3, 1980 (divorced); and most recently to British artist James Prince Taylor.

"I love my family very much," the actress said when asked about her personal life while recalling memories of children with Burton; however, she admitted that maintaining a relationship was challenging due largely in part from public scrutiny as an "iconic Hollywood celebrity." As for current affairs: 
"We're planning to visit Europe this summer — hopefully London or Paris," the actress said optimistically. Though admitting some regret about life choices which have led her there, Taylor added that she nevertheless cherished those years because of unforgettable experiences made during filming across multiple countries with incredible talent like Richard Burton and Laurence Harvey in Europe's most enchanting cities where world-famous restaurants served delicious cuisine to come together for memorable night outings.

Ms. Taylor also spoke about how she feels her best roles have been those that challenged herself as an actress, including playing a deaf character in The World According To White (2018). "It required me not only learning sign language
