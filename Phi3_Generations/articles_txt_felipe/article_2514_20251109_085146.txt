A massive cholera outbreak has hit Yemen since early October, with over 1,000 suspected cases reported in just two months as per officials from the Ministry of Public Health and Population (MOHPP) on December 24th. The United Nations estimates that more than half a million people could be at risk due to contaminated water sources stemming primarily from damaged infrastructure caused by years of conflict within the country, reports CNN.


Health officials report clusters in densely populated urban areas such as Sana'a and Marib with alarming rates of hospitalization among young children under five who are most vulnerable to this deadly waterborne disease that can lead to severe dehydrala;tion, shock, or even death if left untreated.


Dr. Abdulqadir Yahia Al-Bawabani, the head of MOHPP's Disease Prevention and Control Section in Sanaa City, stated: "Our healthcare facilities are struggling to manage this increasing number of cases." He added that they need more funding for cholera vaccines.


International aid groups like Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) have begun their campaign to treat patients but the demand continues to surpass capacity due in part to ongoing hostilities disrupting supply routes, according to a spokesperson quoted by AFP news agency last week. 

"We are working hard every day and with each other's help we hope for progress," said MSF official Marie-Claire Ouedraogo while delivering aid in the city of Al Masnaah yesterday, just west of Yemen’s second largest capital Sanaa.

Yemen continues to face political unrest amid a Saudi Arabia led military coalition's campaign that has caused an economic crisis and widespread destruction since March 2015 - forcing millions into dire conditions without access to clean water or healthcare services, per Reuters news agency.

This outbreak serves as another tragic reminder of how war can devastate a population beyond military casualties — with the UN warning that over 7,600 Yemenis have died from famine since conflict broke out four years ago and about half are children under five-years old.

The World Health Organization has reported approximately ten confirmed cases of cholera per day in Sanaa alone but expects this number to increase without immediate intervention on the ground, which according to Al Bawabani is "critically needed." The UN's humanitarian appeal for Yemen stands at $2.1 billion by year-end 2024 and more funding urgently needs attention amidst an escalating cholera crisis.

The international community, along with local organizations like MOHPP are calling on immediate support to prevent the spread of this disease that could further exacerbate Yemen's already desperate humanitarian situation which is struggling under years of war-induced poverty and famine as described by Al Bawabani.

"No family in Yemen should have to fear for their health or safety because they lack access to clean water," urged a statement made last weekend at the United Nations Security Council meeting on Humanitarian Affairs where member countries discussed intensified aid efforts and financial support towards alleviating suffering in war-torn areas.

"This outbreak needs international attention as well
