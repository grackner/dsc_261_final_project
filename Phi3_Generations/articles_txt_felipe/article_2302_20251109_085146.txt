On Saturday evening, a local community in Venice began their annual celebration of Carnival Day with vibrant costumes and parades that drew tourists from around the world. Over the next two days, visitors flocked to Italy's iconic city-island where artistry meets history at every turn.

Venetians are known for an unmatched flair during Carnival season when tradition takes center stage in a spectacthy that captivates both locals and tourists alike. This year, the festivities will stretch from March 5 to March 7 with parades scheduled throughout the daytime hours as well as stunning masquerade balls held at select hotels along Grand Canal.

CNN's local experts share their thoughts on how this time-honored tradition continues to draw admirers annually: "The essence of Venetian Carnival remains its unrivaled display of creativity and passion, an experience that no tourist could pass up," said James O'Neill, a cultural historian specializing in Italian heritage.

While millions travel to Venice every year for Carnival festivities alone – an estimated 60 million visitors are expected worldwide this year according to tourism boards—the city is also celebrating its historic legacy alongside these modern revelers with numerous exhibitions dedicated to the rich tapestry of Italian culture and history.

Despite ongoing concerns about overtourism, local officials have been proactive in managing foot traffic through strategic planning aimed at preserving Venice's integrity while accommodating its allure as a top travel destination.
