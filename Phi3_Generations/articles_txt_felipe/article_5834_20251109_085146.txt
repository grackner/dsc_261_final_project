As millions of Americans prepare for the presidential election on November 3rd in all states nationwide except Maine and Nebraska where voting is still underway or early polls are open today, tensions remain high as campaign rhet extraneous activities continue to unfold across battlegrounds. Both major political parties' leaders have been making a last-ditch effort throughout the day with door-to-door visits in key districts and final phone banking calls aimed at swaying undecided voters, reflective of what has become an unprecedentedly aggressive election season.

Earlier this month, Ohio Senator John Doe (D) delivered a heartfelt speech on the importance of every vote being counted accurately and fairly in his home state where recounts are becoming more frequent due to razor-thin margins observed so far; 'We must ensure that our democratic process remains robust', he stated during a campaign rally at Cleveland's Municipal Stadium, drawing an emotional response from supporters.
