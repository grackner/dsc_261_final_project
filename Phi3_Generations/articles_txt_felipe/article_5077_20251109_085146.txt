In a dramatic turn of events at Madison Square Garden last night, star point guard James Smith was ejected from Game 7 in an intense NBA playoff final match between the New York Knights and their long-time rivals, the Boston Red Wolves. The confrontation escalated after just five minutes when a heated exchange led to both players getting involved on court with racial slurs exchanged before teammates intervened.

"I've played countless games in my career and never witnessed such disrespect," said the Knights' coach, Michael Thompson as his squad watched their player being whistled out of the game by referees during a timeout called for them on a three-pointer attempt from near halfcourt.

Smith has been under scrutinizing attention following controversial incidents in previous matches against Boston Red Wolves that led to disciplinary action, including benching and suspensions handed down last season after an altercation with former teammate John Doe escalated into a fight on the court which later spilled over offcourt. "Smith's behavior has been unacceptable for our entire organization," said CEO of NBA Player Management Inc., Jane Foster during their annual meeting, and this latest incident appears to be nothing less than an outright provocation that could set back his career significantly if he cannot control himself on the court."

The Knights have not commented yet but it's expected they will release a statement soon. The Red Wolves are already expressing concern about their home-court advantage, as well feeling sympathy for Smith who had been one of basketball’s most reliable players up until last night when he left his teammates holding the fort in overtime to confront Boston on court after being booed off during a timeout.

"I felt awful just now," said Red Wolves' point guard, Eric Brown. "James has never been one for drama but it’s clear something is bothering him and we hope he seeks help."
