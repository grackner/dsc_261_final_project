A recent study has revealed that consuming too much vitamin A can lead to health risks such as dizziness and nausea. Experts are urging caution among pregnant women who often turn to supplements for their nutritional needs, emphasizing the importance of balanced diet choices over excessive reliance on pills or powders containing high levels of vitamin A.

The study was conducted by leading researchers at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and published in The Journal of Clinical Nutrition last month. After analyzing data from more than 10,000 participants over the course of five years, it became apparent that those consuming vitamin A supplements beyond recommended daily intake experienced an increased risk for adverse symptoms linked to hypervitaminosis A.

Dr. Sarah Thompson, one of the researchers involved in this study and a professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, stated, "Our findings suggest that there is such thing as too much goodness when it comes to vitamin intake - something pregnant women or their healthcare providers must consider."

Pregnant individuals typically increase their nutrient consumption due to the critical role these extra doses play in supporting fetal growth and development. However, this study warns that an over-reliance on high-dose vitamin A supplements could be counterproductive by potentially leading to harmful side effects like vomiting or even hair loss among other symptoms of hypervitaminosis A: "We were surprised at the extent and persistence of these negative health impacts," Dr. Thompson explained further in an interview with Medical News Today.

Another expert on nutrition, dietitian Emily Green from Washington University School of Medicine highlighted that balanced food sources such as cod liver oil or dairy products are safer and provide essential fat-soluble vitamins like A without the risk associated with high doses. "It's always best to get nutrients through whole, unprocessed food whenever possible," Green advised in a recent interview for Healthline News Service where she explained that while supplements can help fill dietary gaps under specific circumstances such as pregnancy or malnutrition - they should never be overused.

This revelation comes at an especially sensitive time, considering the increase of vitamin A market sales which have risen by 5% in past year alone according to data from NutraIngredients-Walmart US Inc., highlighting growing public awareness about supplements for nutritional needs. With this study's findings and increased regulatory scrut083bility, leading health authorities are now urging individuals especially pregnant women to seek professional guidance before deciding on their vitamin intake levels from food or dietary aids like pills/powders etc..

The Center for Disease Control (CDC) Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky, in an interview with CNN Healthline Services yesterday stated: "We urge the public to consult healthcare providers before starting vitamin A supplementation especially during pregnancy due to potential risks associated."

Furthermore, several states have begun implementing awareness programs and labeling reforms that clearly denote if food contains high levels of naturally occurring nutrients like Vitamin A. The move is being hailed as a step towards informed di
