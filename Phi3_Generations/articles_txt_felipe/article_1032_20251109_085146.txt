On Thursday morning in New York City's financial district, a local businessman was caught making what seemed to be an unconventional investment move which could potentially disrupt the market if widely adopted. Charles Thompson invested heavily into Artificial Intelligence research and development last week at his private firm based on Greenwich Avenue – one of Wall Street's most prestigious roads.

Mr. Thompson, who owns a series of luxury apartments around Central Park West as well as several high-end restaurants in the area, made waves when he announced that 20% of his latest investment portfolio would go into AI startups looking to make groundbreaking advances within healthcare and education.

"It's not just about profits for us anymore," Thompson stated during an exclusive interview with Business Weekly last Friday, "We want to be part of a future where technology can genuinely improve lives." The decision drew praise from several industry experts who see the potential impact as significant if others follow suit.

The businessman's move comes at a time when big tech companies are investing billions in AI research, but most returns to those capital go back into further developing their own platforms rather than fund independent ventures directly linked to societal needs like healthcare and education - two areas that continue to face systemic issues.

Thompson's firm will allocate $50 million from his personal fortune towards this end after consulting with renowned futurists, technologists, social scientists, educators, medical professionals among others before making the decision last weekend when he was at Harvard Business School for a leadership summit.

"We believe there's untapped potential in AI that can help us tackle some of society’s most pressing problems," said Dr Sylvia Rodriguez, Chief Innovation Officer from Thompson's firm who has worked with top universities and leading tech companies for years before joining his venture last year.

Dr Rodriguez emphasized the need to balance potential risks against rewards of AI in healthcare where it could revolutionize diagnosis but might also raise privacy concerns due to extensive data collection requirements necessary for its development, as well as ethical dilemmas related to bias within algorithms if not carefully monitored.

In education too, she sees promise with intelligent tutors providing personalized learning experiences catering specifically to each student's unique strength and weaknesses which could vastly improve the current struggling public school system in America according to recent studies conducted by EdTechWatch - a reputable industry-research firm.

Sources say that Thompson’s next step will be meeting with government officials regarding potential policies around AI development, funding and regulation as he wants his investments not only to provide financial returns but also societal benefits while ensuring they don't pose any risks on public safety or welfare.

While some experts remain skeptical about the feasibility of this grand plan due to bureaucratic hurdles and slow policy changes, Thompson believes that it is his responsibility as an affluent citizen with influence over significant capital investments like these which have far-reaching impacts.

"I understand not everyone sees things my way," he said during another interview on the sidelines of a tech conference last weekend where businesses across industries gathered to discuss potential collaborations and breakthrough innovation, "But if we don
