A tragic accident occurred at a Tokyo-area swimming facility on Saturday during an Olympic triathlon qualifier when two athletes drowned in the open water portion of the race amidst treacherous currents that swept them into nearby rocks offshore from Odaiba Marine Forest Park. The mishap took place just hours before a crucial men's and women' endurance challenge, which serves as an Olympic qualifier for next year’s Games in Paris with finalists determined by the day following this race; however, organizers will now be re-evaluating safety protocols at Tokyo 2021.

Two competitors were seen struggling against fierce currents near Odaiba Marine Forest Park shortly after they plunged into open waters for a triathlon segment of an Olympic qualifier yesterday evening; it is unclear how many individuals have been rescued from the water or if there are any other victims unaccounted. Tokyo’s Maritime and Water Bureau announced that swift action had led to four athletes' rescue, as they were swept into rocks offshore approximately 10 minutes after their dive took place on Friday evening; it is feared those stranded may still be trapped underwater or at least submerged in the wreckage.

"The strong currents we experienced here today are not something I've seen before," stated Shigeaki Suzuki, an Olympic triathlon official from Tokyo 2020 organizing committee who witnessed events unfold during this weekend’s competition; he noted that the waves were unusually powerful and unpredictable.

The disastrous incident happened shortly after competitors took to open waters in what had been a calm day at Odaiba Marine Forest Park, near Tokyo Bay on Friday evening (local time); athletes must complete two-and-a-half miles of swimming against currents that can reach upwards of 4.5 knots - about as strong and fast winds during hurricane season in the southern United States; organizers had initially forecasted only mildly choppy waters with negligible waves, but unexpected meteorological conditions turned hazardous minutes after competition began.

"I didn't expect such a turn of events," said Yumi Nakamura, an Olympic triathlon competitor who finished the race safely; she recounted how athletes were seen frantically trying to save themselves and others from being dragged underwater by powerful currents that appeared almost instantly after they entered the water.

With three other rescued swimmers in critical condition, all of them requiring immediate medical attention at Tokyo Metropolitan Medical University Hospital; authorities have not yet disclosed if any fatalities occurred or how many individuals are unaccounted for as searches continue today along with thorough investigations into what led to the tragedy. The event is being scrutinized by a panel consisting mainly comprised of local government officials, Olympic organizers and safety experts; they hope that insights gathered from this review will improve conditions in future Olympics events across Tokyo Bay region during competition seasons when waters can become perilously dangerous for athletes due to seasonal weather patterns.

"We need to take lessons here not just as a community but on an international level," stated Hiroshi Yamamoto, head of the local government's Maritime Safety Division; he stressed that changes in safety protocols and policies must be made before major events like triathlons or even marathon races can
