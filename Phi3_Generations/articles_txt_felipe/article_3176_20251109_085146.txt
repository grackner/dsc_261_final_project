In an unprecedented move within professional football circles, a group of players from various teams has come together to form their own league called "Empire Football League" with its inaugural season set to kick off next month in the New York area. The unique concept promises regular-season games alongside playoffs and championships, all under one roof without geographical constraints on team membership or location of matches being played across state lines for a truly national footprint.

The players behind this initiative have come together after years of discussions about bringing their love for the sport closer to communities that often felt overlooked by mainstream professional football events and decisions made at higher organizational levels within NFL leadership. The league's first match will be hosted on September 15th, with fans already showing interest in attending both local matches as well as nationwide games featuring prominent players from major leagues who have chosen to join this independent endeavor for the love of football and a chance at professional growth outside their current careers.

"I've always loved playing ball since I was little, but it felt like there wasn’t much opportunity here in New York State," said James Smithsonian, one player who is both part of Empire Football League as well an offseason guest starter with the Buffalo Bills where he has seen his potential recognized. "This gives us a platform to show what we can really do without worrying about politics or finances affecting our chances."

Officials behind EmpiresFL have been working towards establishing clear regulations and league structure, along with securing funding through sponsorships from local businesses within the New York state. This initiative seeks to offer an alternative pathway for talented young players who desire more exposure but feel limited by their regional opportunities in traditional college recruitment processes or overseas leagues like Europe's top division where language barriers exist alongside cultural differences which often prove challenging on the field and off.

"We see ourselves as an extension of professional football, giving local talents a chance to showcase themselves while gaining valuable experience," said Richard Greenberg from New York Dynasty Football Club who will serve as commissioner for Empire League's inaugural season along with his regular duties on the NYDFC team. "The NFL has its place and we understand that, but there are so many talented players out here just waiting for a shot like never before."

As word spread about this upcoming league taking shape in New York State amidst growing interest among fans across all age groups who see an opportunity to support their hometown heroes alongside the well-established faces of professional football. While there are still many hurdles ahead, including finalizing team rosters and confirming stadium logistics which have already started taking shape within New York City itself with plans in place for both indoor arenas as well open air fields where matches will be held during colder months to ensure maximum attendance despite weather conditions.

The Empire Football League represents a bold move by players seeking professionalism and competition, not just outside the NFL but across America's football landscape which could have ripple effects on talent development opportunities for many years down the road should this concept prove successful both in terms of player progression to next levels as well financially sustaining themselves throughout their careers while still being able to give back through playing or coaching local youth leagues across New York State. 

Next steps involve finalizing team rosters and securing funding from sponsorships which has already begun
