BOSTON – A local health food chain has been linked to a rare outbreak of digestive illness among consumers over the past month in Boston and surrounding areas, according to state officials' latest report dated February 28th. At least ten individuals have reported symptoms consistent with campylobacteriosis, an infectious intestinal disease caused by bacteria found commonly in raw or undercooked poultry, unpasteurized milk and contaminated water sources.

The health department's investigation led officials to Green & Leaf Organic Eatery on Beacon Hill where the chain has been sourcing their chicken supply from a small farm upstate since last fall season. Inspections found that some of the restaurant’s food handlers failed basic hygiene practices, and multiple samples were contaminated with campylobacter bacteria right down to cutting boards used in preparing dishes.

"This is not an isolated incident," said Dr. Susan Park, Health Commissioner for Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH). "We are currently expanding our investigation." 

Local residents who frequent the eatery shared their experiences with symptoms that included diarrhea and fever last week which they now claim to be linked back to Green & Leaf Organic Eatery's chicken meals. Among them, Carol Smith said she fell ill after eating at the restaurant on February 21st, adding her case was quite severe requiring hospitalization for a few days before subsiding gradually.

"I have never felt this sick in my life," Mrs. Smith claimed while sharing how relieved and shocked everyone around here are to hear about potential foodborne illness outbreaks linked with local restaurants these past weeks, "It's unnerving that it could all be tracries back to one single source."

This latest incident follows a similar scare last month where another health-focused Boston eatery faced its share of customers suffering from food poisoning after consuming homemade granola bars infected with salmonella bacteria. As the state ramps up efforts for stringent safety inspections in all eateries, experts like Dr. James Haley, Director at Tufts University’s Center For Foodborne Research & Prevention (CFRP) warns against complacency when it comes to food hygiene and handling practices within restaurants serving raw or undercooked dishes which could increase chances of illness outbreak.

“It is crucial for people, both restaurant owners and diners alike understand the importance in following appropriate hand-washing guidelines after using public restrooms before touching food preparation areas,” said Dr. Haley who has been studying various pathogens causing gastrointestinal ailments affecting local communities for over two decades now.

As Boston Public Health officials continue to conduct their investigations, they will likely issue more updates on the findings of these incidents and possible repercussions towards those found at fault in coming days while emphasizing preventive measures that individuals can take when preparing meals containing raw foods like poultry or dairy products.

"It's unfortunate to hear such stories about compromised safety standards," said Mayor Joe Tucker, "However our top priority remains safeguarding public health and we will not let it slide until all businesses adhere strictly with necessary protocols."
