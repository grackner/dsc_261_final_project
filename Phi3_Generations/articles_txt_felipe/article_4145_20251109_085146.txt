NASA's Hubble telescope captures mesmerizing view of nebula NGC 6820 in Orion Nebula Cluster; astronomers hope to learn more about star formation process that took place over a million years ago, taking just minutes via time-lapse technology. This recent discovery has given scientists new insights into the cosmic nursery where stars are born within these clouds of dust and gas called nebulae. NGC 6820 is part of one such cluster located about 1500 light years away in the constellation Orion, near Earth'table location relative to it as seen from space agency press release on Wednesday evening (local time).

"Astronomers have been studying these cosmic clouds for decades, but Hubble has given us an unprecedented look at what happens within them," says Dr. Maria Rosales-Barros of the University of California Observatories who helped with data analysis using specialized software that creates time-lapse simulations from telescope images taken over extended periods (NGC 6820 was observed for multiple days).

This nebula, which is approximately three light years in diameter and contains countless hot young stars glowing brightly against the backdrop of dust and gas, stands out due to its unique appearance - resembling an interconnected spider-web pattern with pockets representing embryonic star systems. The Hubble's observations have allowed researchers like Dr. Rosales-Barros and team at NASA Astrophysics Science Division in Goddard Space Flight Center (GSLF) to observe these processes as they happen, using the time dimension offered by capturing multiple images over days or weeks of observation cycles with Hubble's Wide Field Camera 3 instrument.

The latest observations reveal that star formation within NGC 6820 is ongoing and active; however, scientists believe it may have begun more than a million years ago when the nebula was first formed from shockwaves triggered by supernovae explosions or collisions between clouds of gas. The Hubble images captured recently provide new insights into this ancient cosmic phenomenon wherein gravity pulls together colossal amounts of interstellar material, leading to proto-stars eventually igniting in nuclear fusion reactions once they reach critical density and temperature at their cores – a process that could take as little as minutes under the time-lapse perspective.

NASA officials hope these latest findings will shed light on longstanding questions about star formation within massive, dense regions of interstellar space where dusty nebulae are located in close proximity to each other; typically found near supermassive black holes at galactic centers or stellar nurseries like the Orion Nebula Cluster. Understanding how young stars evolve over time is crucial for understanding our own Solar System's past and evolution, as well as its potential fate in billions of years to come when it exhausts hydrogen fuel within itself and dies off into a white dwarf surrounded by an expanding remnant cloud known colloquially amongst astrophysicists simply referred to as 'the aftermath.'

Scientific American reporter John Doe commented on the significance of this research in his recent article: "With Hubble's observations, astronomers can now study star formation processes not just from historical data but also watch them unfold real-time. This will contribute greatly towards understanding how stars are born and evolve across millions to
