After years in development hell, legendary director Alfred Hitchcock's lost script for a potential new film has been discovered deep within an archive at the British Film Institute. The unearthed treasure could be one of cinema’ enduring mysteries: what might have happened if his masterpiece “Vertigo” had inspired sequels? According to reports, on Monday morning in London (May 5), archivist Emily Carter stumbled upon a collection of original handwritten pages that hint at Hitchcock's unfulfilled desire for narrative expansion beyond the Academy Award-winning thriller.

The script found inside suggests intricate storylines involving characters from his other films, creating an alternate reality in which they confront their darkest demons or relive classic scenes with twists that could have changed movie history forever. Hitchcock's former studio exec and close collaborator, John Wright, said the discovery was a "striking testament to [Hitchcock]’s genius" but added he hopes nothing will come of it now as fans prefer his one-of-a-kind masterpieces in their original form.

While no timetable has been set for production or release, many are calling the script a "cultural treasure," providing unique insight into Hitchcock's unmatched creativity and imagination - elements that have made his films stand as benchmark of excellence over decades. Experts predict this finding could lead to an annual festival celebrating alternative narratives in classic cinema, with directors from around the world invited to adapt pieces using their own visionary styles while staying faithful to Hitchcock's original concepts and themes; however some critics feel it might be best if such a project remained on paper as tributes alone.
