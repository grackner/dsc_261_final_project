**New Study Links Quality of Romantic Relationships to Longer Life and Reduced Stress Levels**

A groundbrein study published in the Lancet Psychiatry journal suggests that individuals with high-quality romantic relationships tend to live longer, have lower stress levels during their lifetimes compared to those who are single or experience poor relationship quality. The research was conducted by a team of psychologists and public health experts at Yale University and released last Thursday.

The study analyzed data from over 10,000 participants between the ages of 25-64 across various demographics to identify trends in longevity tied directly or indirectly to their relationship statuses and satisfaction levels with said relationships throughout life. Participants were asked about aspects like communication quality within relationships, feelings of loneliness as well as societal expectations surrounding romantic partnerships.

"Our findings indicate that people who report being in the happiest stage of a relationship tend to live longest and experience less stress overall," says Dr. Jennifer Pawelski from Yale University's School of Public Health, lead author on this study which took five years to complete with funding support provided by National Institutes for Mental Health among other sponsors; "Moreover when we looked deeper into the data it appears that being in a healthy relationship may buffer some people against common stress factors such as unemployment or financial difficulties."

The researchers used validated psychological questionnaires to assess perceived romantic support and found significant differences among different age groups, gender identities but most importantly between races. For example black women reported significantly lower levels of happiness within relationships compared with white men at similar ages even when controlling for socioeconomic status or marital/cohabitation history thus emphasizing further research is required before drawing firm conclusions on why this discrepancy exists - if it does indeed exist.

A 45-year old divorced mother of two from New York City who participated in the study shared how much better her life felt after finding love again: "I never thought I'd find someone like him and that he would want to be with me...It turns out we were soulmates all along! We both enjoy traveling, trying new foods as well. He helps around at home too so it definitely feels less burdensome when compared against previous years."

While many factors have been identified in prior research such a strong family history of mental illnesses or substance abuse may negatively impact overall relationship quality hence resulting in shorter lifespans for those affected but these findings offer hope that interventions targeting improving communication skills within relationships could potentially increase happiness levels and extend lives.

The authors urge policymakers not only to focus on providing affordable housing or better employment opportunities which have already proven effective at reducing stress in various populations,but also pay closer attention towards mental health services addressing issues related specifically pertaining relationship challenges faced by diverse communities such as LGBTQ+ folks experiencing discrimination from societal norms around marriage.

Dr Samantha Jones an expert on romantic relationships at University College London comments: "It's essential for people to have access to therapies that can help them navigate conflicts when they arise within partnerships because this leads directly into lower stress levels and subsequently improved health outcomes in the long run."
