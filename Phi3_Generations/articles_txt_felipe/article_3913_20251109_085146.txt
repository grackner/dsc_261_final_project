An oil tanker carrying millions of gallons of fuel from Saudi Arabia was hijacked just off the coast of Nigeria on Monday evening by a group claiming to represent local fishermen's interests, according to officials in Abuja and Lagos, who expressed deep concern over potential economic impact.

Captain Ibrahim Abdullahi reportedly faced armed men at gunpoint as they took control just 10 miles from Nigeria’s coastline around sunset on Monday, with the pirates demanding a ransom of $2 million within seven days to ensure his and crew's safety. The standoff was resolved after six hours when negotiations began between oil industry representatives and government security forces; however, it led to unforeseen consequences for Nigeria’s fragile economy as well as implications on global fuel supplies in West Africa.

"The hijacking has caused disruinating effects not just locally but also regionally," said President Muhammed Buhari's adviser and security expert, General Abdulrasheed Bello; "We must work diligently to resolve this issue before it escalates further." 

As fear of a potential spillover effect grows among neighboring countries such as Benin, Togo, Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire and Guinea-Bissau due its close proximity with Nigeria; some are taking measures to safeguard against this growing threat. "We need more joint patrols across borders" said Minister of Foreign Affairs Yaw Osafo Maarten Annan Fordjour who urged the Gulf states, particularly Saudi Arabia and Kuwaiti-based Qatari firm that operate tankers in these waters to play a proactive role.

This latest act adds pressure on Nigerian government which is already dealing with its own security challenges within prone areas of insurgency as well as piracy, fuelled by decades-long poverty and corruption plaguing the oil rich nation since independence from Britain in 1960. In recent years, militant group Boko Haram had launched a series attacks on government installations causing major political turmoil; last year alone they managed to hijack at least two tankers along this stretch of coastline leading international shipping companies like Maersk and COSCO Asia changing their route by sea.

Experts say these recent acts have significant implications for global markets as fuel supplies are already limited due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict; disruptions here can lead not only countries in Africa but also Europe facing supply issues with immediate impact on industries and citizens who would find their daily lives affected. "There's a clear domino effect taking place where regional unrest feeds into broader geopolitical consequences," explained security analyst Dr. Ngozi Okafor; however, she emphasized that international cooperation could be key in addressing such challenges before they escalate further - urging all stakeholders involved including shipping companies to share intelligence and work closely with government bodies on an effective response strategy while maintaining the flow of fuel supplies.

With Nigeria's economy heavily reliant on oil revenues, this latest act highlights just how important it is for African nations not only in terms of their internal stability but also regarding global market dynamics as well - prompting calls from various government officials across West Africa to hold joint military exercises along shorelines and strengthen maritime security policies going
