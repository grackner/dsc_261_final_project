Following yesterday's announcement that Warner Bros has been greenlit to produce a reboot of "Blade Runner," fans are thrilled about what promises to be another classic science fiction masterpiece set in the grimy, rain-soaked streets of Los Angeles. The sequel is expected to hit cinemas on December 15th and will star Joaquin Phoenix reprising his iconic role as a bounty hunter tasked with locating rogue replicants who pose a threat to society in the near future.

Producers confirmed that they have acquired exclusive filming rights from Universal Pictures, which has released "Blade Runner" on DVD and Blu-ray for over two decstatic years after its initial release as part of the "Dark Universe." The sequel will also feature a diverse cast with prominent roles being played by Leonardo DiCaprio, Rina Skaidridai from Latvia who is known for her breakout role in 'The Great Gatsby,' and veteran actor Michael Douglas.

A spokesperson explained that the script has been completely reworked to address many of its predecessor's controversies around gender portrayals, racial diversity, as well as criticisms over scientific accuracy with regards replicants themselves - a form of genetically modified bounty hunters in search for individuals who have integrated copies and can no longer differentiate from the real ones.

In an interview yesterday: "We're committed to bringing back what audiences fell in love with first time around, but we promise our version will not only uphold that nostalgia factor - it’s also going out of its way making sure women and people of color are seen as heroes."

This news comes on the heels of an announcement from Amazon Studios about a television adaptation starring Ryan Gosling set for development in Canada, which caused significant buzz among movie buffs across multiple platforms. 

Director Denis Villeneuve emphasized that while they respected those efforts to adapt "Blade Runner" elsewhere: “We wanted our take on the film storyline and look of Los Angeles back then be true for this sequel, but with a conscious focus towards inclusivity.” The set designers are working closely together in collaboration between Dutch studio Eidos-Midborne Design (EID) to bring forth that vision.

“This movie is about more than just shooting on location,” explained one producer who requested anonymity due to contract concerns, “it’s also a reflection of the society we live today.” 

The film's first trailer will be released this weekend for those eagerly awaiting another cinematic journey into science fiction realms. The director and studio hope that fans from all backgrounds can find common ground amidst their beloved characters, while also sparking necessary dialogue around representation in the media industry itself as a whole."
