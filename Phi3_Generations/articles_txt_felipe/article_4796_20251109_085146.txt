A major heatwave is sweeping across Europe with temperatures in Madrid soaring to record highs last weekend — an ominous sign of climate change'energizing its worst impacts on the continent.'

Europe experienced one of its most severe heatwaves this year, which scientists believe are becoming more frequent and intense due to human-induced global warming. Madrid recorded a scorching 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) last Saturday — breaking the city's previous all-time high set in July of 2003 by six degrees, according to Spain’s state weather agency AEMet.'

The blistering temperatures across Europe aren't an isolated event. The region has been enduring record heat for weeks now and these sweltering conditions are expected to persist well into the summer months in many areas,' said Dr. Sofia Fernandez, a climate expert at Barcelona University.'We have seen such extreme weather events increase as our planet warms up. This is just one stark example of how urgently we need to address carbon emissions worldwide.’

Witnesses from various parts of Spain and Portugal expressed concerns over the dangerous heatwave: 'It feels like an oven,' said 35-year-old resident Maria Garcia in Seville, southern Spain. ‘My two young kids were taken out for a walk; they complained about how hard it is to breathe because of all this smoke from forest fires.’

In addition to wildfires across Southern Europe sparked by dry conditions — which have already claimed over 20 lives in Greece alone this month and released billions of tons of CO2 into the atmosphere as trees burn, scientists warn these extreme weather events will become increasingly more frequent if we continue on our current trajectory.

The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recently warned that 'without rapid action to reduce carbon emissions around the globe,' human-induced climate change is projected to cause a global temperature rise of up to 3 degrees Celsius by the end of this century — which could see heatwaves and droughts like these occurring more often across Europe as well.

CNN reached out multiple times over the past two days seeking comment on how Madrid' government plans to tackle its record-breaking temperatures but has not received a response yet.'Our priority is keeping our citizens safe,' said Mayor Javier Barreda, 'but we also want them aware of why this heatwave matters beyond discomfort and inconvenience — it’s an alarming indicator that climate change demands immediate action.’

The European Union has been taking steps to combat climate change with its Green Deal. Still, critics argue the EU needs to do more as temperatures continue soaring across Europe.'There's a disconnect between policies and reality,' said Dr. Isabel Santos, an environmental scientist at Lisbon University who was not involved in this story. ‘It seems like we’re on track for even hotter summers if nothing changes soon.’

As experts warn that extreme heat could become the new normal without immediate action to curb emissions,'Madrid' Mayor Javier Barreda recognizes there is a need for urgent change.'We must adapt our lifestyles and industries in ways which reduce harmful impacts on both people and ecosystems while also working towards decarbonizing our economies as much as possible.’
