In a historic turn of events that has sent shockwaves across the Asian continent yesterday afternoon in Seoul, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un announced his second meeting with South Korea's President Moon Jae-in since their summit at Panmunjom last year. The impromptdependent news comes as tensions remain high between both nations following recent border skirmishes and escalating rhetoric from Pyongyang towards Seoul, which has long been an ally of the United States in Asia's security landscape.

The two leaders met for nearly three hours at a South Korean official residence near Cheongyecheon stream on Friday afternoon after Moon invited Kim to meet with him again last week amid soaring tensions over North Korea's repeated nuclear and missile tests that have threatened regional peace, as well as its claims about developing intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the United States.

"I met today not just for talks but also out of friendship between our countries," Kim told reporters after his meeting with Moon at Cheongyecheon Stream in Seoul's affluent Gangnam district, which was heavily guarded by South Korean military forces and marked the first public appearance made directly since he had returned from a trip to Moscow that included visits with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

South Korea has long maintained it seeks nothing more than peaceful coexistence on the peninsula where families across generations have been divided for over 70 years and which remains one of Asia's most heavily fortified borders even as Pyongyang continues to test its nuclear capabilities despite UN sanctions.

Moon, in his opening remarks at Kim Jong-un’s residence yesterday before the summit began about an hour after Moon had met with Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier that day also sought peace and prosperity for both Koreas as well as a reunited peninsula within one generation while stressing denuclearization of North Korea was necessary to achieve these goals.

"In this era, we cannot afford the wasteful expenditure on nuclear weapons," Moon told reporters after his meeting with Kim that ended around 5 p.m., saying he also sought talks in which both sides could discuss easing sanctions and security issues between Seoul and Pyongyang as well to ensure a peace treaty ending the Korean War, fought almost exactly half-a-century ago, was finally signed once hostilities have truly ceased on the peninsula.

North Korea has long maintained it seeks denuclearization of its arsenal but insists this process be linked with sanctions relief and international economic assistance that would address widespread poverty throughout North Korean society while also ensuring security guarantees to Pyongyang from Seoul, Washington, Tokyo as well as Beijing.

"The fact remains the two Koreas are still on hostile footing despite talks so far this year between Moon and Kim," said a South Korea expert in foreign affairs at Dongguk University who asked not to be named due to the sensitive nature of his work monitoring North Korean policy for Seoul's government.

"The two Koreas will never truly denuclearize unless Pyongyang is willing to genuinely renounce its nuclear ambitions, which remains extremely unlikely at this stage," he told CNN. "It seems as though both governments are more interested in building bridges of friendship than getting down to brass tacks."
