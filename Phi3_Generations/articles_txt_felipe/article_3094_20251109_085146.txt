In a bold statement on body diversity and fashion inclusivity, New York's iconic Chanel has announced its latest runway show will exclusively feature plus-size models for the first time in their history. Set to debut this fall at Paris Fashion Week with an expected attendance of over 20 celebrities known for advocating body positivity and size inclusivity, including Chrissy Teigen and Ashley Graham, Chanel's decision marks a significant step forward in challenging traditional fashion norms that have long marginalized larger bodies.

The French luxury brand has reportedly begun casting models with sizes ranging from 16 to 28 according to US-size chart standards for the fall season runway show, while still maintaining their signature haute couture aesthetic and attention to detail that they are revered for. Despite concerns about backlash or criticism in what is an industry often resistant to change, Chanel has expressed determination to embrace diversity within its ranks without compromising on style quality or exclusivity which defines the brand's image.

"We want everyone who feels represented by a fashionable look that suits them perfectly and boosts their confidence," said Sophie The Shop Owner at Couture Chic, an independent accessory boutique in SoHo supporting diverse sizes and styles. "Plus-size individuals have always had to seek style outside of conventional stores for this reason."

Reaction from the fashion industry has been mixed since news broke out yesterday with some hailing it as a progressive move that will hopefully pave way towards more inclusivity in high fashion while others remain skeptical about its longevity. Some argue Chanel, known primarily for their timeless designs and impeccable craftsmanship rather than pushing trends or breaking new ground with runway models have decided to make this change at a time when the body positivity movement is gaining momentum in various social spheres including politics and media where larger bodies are being celebrated more publicly.

Camille Dupree, who has spent nearly two decades as an editorial stylist for Vogue Paris expressed cautious optimism: "This step by Chanel isn't just about aesthetics or fashion trends but also sending out a strong statement that all body types can belong in haute couture. This is something I truly hope we see more brands taking, especially given the influence of this industry."

Eva Rosario, Dior representative who has worked closely with Chanel through various collaborations believes it's about time an international brand known for their classic silhouettes and elegant aesthetic takes note. "Chanel making such decision is indeed noteworthy as they are acknowledging the diversity of body types that exist in our world today," she said, adding this could potentially impact how other major brands approach casting in future seasons if Chanel continues to maintain its success and reputation post-showcase.

Critics have raised concerns about possible consumer backlash with some fearing it might send the wrong message by associating bigger bodies only within high fashion world, but supporters argue that exposure could help shift societal norms around body image where celebration of all shapes and sizes is not just limited to smaller platforms.

As for next steps, industry insiders hope Chanel's show will inspire other luxury brands or labels across the globe who may follow suit in breaking away from conventional casting practices which have long excluded plus-size individuals based
