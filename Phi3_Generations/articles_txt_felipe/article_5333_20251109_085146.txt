In a stunning display of artistic expression and cultural exchange at London's Royal Festival Hall last Saturday, over twenty local musicians joined forces with international artists to celebrate the universal language of music across different styles on International Day of Music by donning colorful costumes inspired by traditional folk attire from around the world. The event took place live via Facebook stream in conjunction with London's annual cultural festival that draws hundreds, thousands over five days each year and attracted online viewers globally throughout Saturday evening as a tribute to diversity within music styles.


"When I saw people of different backgrounds come together through this initiative last weekend; it filled my heart with joy," remarked Emma Richardson, founder of Global Harmony Arts Collective that organized the event and advocates for cultural understanding via arts programs across diverse communities worldwide. "We wanted to bring a vibrant mix of styles under one roof."


From Irish flute tunes mingling seamlessly with Andean panpipes, classical violin pieces performed alongside African drum rhythms — the eclectic lineup showcased an amalgamation that highlighted common threads in musical expressions across cultures. The performers donned attire ranging from Victorian dresses to Indian sarees and Japanese kimonos; each look was intricate, telling a story of their cultural background through fashion as well as music.


Music critic Robert Langsdorf attended the event at the Royal Festival Hall in London on Saturday evening where he shared his perspective: "This performance felt like stepping into different parts of history and geography simultaneously—it's truly remarkable how seamlessly diverse instruments can create a harmonic blend." The live Facebook stream captivated online viewers with visual representations, such as animations illustrating the evolution of each music style.


Despite being virtual due to global pandemic concerns, participants and audience felt intimately connected through real-time conversations that took place in a chat room on social media platforms during intermissions where they shared personal experiences about their cultural heritages related to specific songs played at the event. This initiative not only bridged geographical gaps but also fostered an appreciation for artistic diversity within music styles amongst viewers, promoting international understanding through a universal language without borders or limitations — all this on International Day of Music celebrated across nations worldwide since 2015 by UNESCO.


The success and warm response to the event have prompted organizers like Richardson to consider making it an annual virtual gathering, hoping that music remains not just as entertainment but also a beacon for unity in diversity through artistic expression across different styles of folk traditions worldwide on this special day dedicated annually since 2015.
