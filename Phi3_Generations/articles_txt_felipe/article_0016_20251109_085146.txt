During a Tuesday night game at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles on May 5th, an unexpected event led to both jubilation and confusion among fans attending the LA Dodgers vs. San Francisco Giants matchup: A group of adorable puppies wandered onto the field just as the seventh-inning stretch began.

The sight quickly became a viral sensation on social media, with many laughing and taking selfies while snapping photos of what can only be described as an interruption to baseball tradition by these fluffy intruders who appeared out of nowhere in center field during the middle innings stretch before the seventh-inning national anthem.

Among those captured on video was a mother and father, holding their own little bundles of joy with bright eyes as they marveled at the audience's response to these charming canines entering right into play—their legs seemingly oblivious to pitcher Mike Smith throwing strikes in what would have been an average moment for any baseball game.

"They looked around, not sure where I was taking them," said Lisa Thompson, one of the parents whose three dogs joined their party at a nearby food truck before wandering onto the field during Dodger Stadium's sixth-inning stretch when she had called out to her friends enjoying themselves in front. "When they saw everyone cheering for these puppies – well let’s just say it was magical."

It appears that local law enforcement were on hand, cordoning off the area around Dodger Stadium's gates where fans enter and exit during a game to prevent unauthorized entry—and now uninvited animals from dashing onto the playing field. But Officer Carlos Rodriguez commented with amusement after seeing people trying to catch these unexpected guests on video as they ran across behind home plate: "I guess everyone wanted to have their own little moment here tonight."

The Giants pitcher, Johnny Cueto was seen exchanging friendly waves and smiles while throwing at least one strike in the final two innings after a few paws were shooed out into left field by an enthusiastic fan wearing Dodgers merchandise. "It's been crazy," says Tommy Sanchez, who attended with friends from his East LA community group and was capturing memories while standing next to the Giants dugout during a lull in play after catching two of these furry guests himself: “We saw them coming over the fence at first base—it looked like an off-duty dog walker brought her three dogs out with this group, and they must’ve just been exploring.”

Late on Tuesday night news reached sports commentators during a break in another game about how these puppies were quickly dubbed the "Dodger Pups" by local media due to their timing coming into play right before national anthem. Commentator Sarah Jones commented: “Well, baseball's got its own version of intermission with that stretch but I must say it’s hard not to smile when those little ones come trotting onto the field.”

CNN Sports Correspondent Michael Thomas had this reaction on Twitter while watching an interview with a Giants player from another game: "I'm laughing at what went down last night in LA. Those Dodger Pups are turning heads and bringing joy to all of Los Angeles baseball fans." His comments got retweeted over
