In a series of coordinated attacks across European cities this weekend, multiple countries have experienced security breaches resulting in widespstatic panic and confusion among citizens. The alarming incidents unfolded on Saturday evening when explosions were reported near tourist attractions within Paris, followed by similar occurrences in Rome's historic center, London’s iconic landmarks including Buckingham Palace, the Tower of London, as well as several locations in Berlin – and finally Amsterdam's famous canal district. Authorities have not yet publicly confirmed if these attacks are connected or orchestrated with a shared motive but emphasized they take all threats seriously to ensure citizens’ safety.

"We ask everyone to remain calm," said French Interior Minister Gerard Darmanin, who assured that the situation was under control and well-handled by security forces in France as of today (Monday). 

In Italy, Prime Minister Mario Draghi emphasized his government’s resolve against threats.
