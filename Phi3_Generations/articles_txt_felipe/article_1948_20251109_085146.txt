A magnitude-7 earthquake struck off the coast of Queensland on Friday morning local time, rattling buildings across Brisbdestown and prompting immediate evacuations in nearby areas including Cairns and Townsville due to potential tsunami threats identified by emergency services. Witnesses reported that tremors began just after 7 AM AEDT (Australian Eastern Daylight Time) with many feeling the shakes as their homes shook for several minutes, before a warning siren sounded at precisely 8:04 AM local time signaling an urgent evacuation order. Emergency management officials have been dispatched to provide aid and assess damage in affected areas but were unable to confirm reports of serious injuries or fatalities as the aftershocks continue this morning, although concerns remain high due to potential tsunami risks along coastlines exposed during yesterday's seismic activity. Residents from towns stretching all across Queensland’s north-east region have been advised not to return home until at least late afternoon barring explicit directions by authorities and that further assistance may be required for those who were unable to evacuate in time as the waves began hitting around 9:15 AM local. "We are working round-the-clock with emergency services trying our best to get everyone out of harm's way," said Queensland Premier Anita Johnson, amid calls from community members and family for better preparation protocols before any natural disaster strikes their region once again in recent history. Authorities have also been coordinating closely with the Australian Seismic Network monitoring stations across several locations to assess seismic activity aftermath but are still awaiting a clearer picture of damages as they prioritize rescue efforts and urging calm amid growing concerns for more significant tsunami risks expected later this afternoon if predictions by geologists prove accurate.
