Beijing saw a significant increase in local tourism on Saturday as thousands of residents escaped city life for weekend getawries amidst rising COVID-19 cases across the country. The sudden surge has prompted officials to issue travel advisories and reassure locals that necessary measures are being taken without causing panic among the population.

Over 50,000 tourists from Beijing visited scenic spots in Hebei province this weekend alone—a stark contrast to last year's figures which were significantly lower due to tight restrictions during most of 2021 and early into this year as China battled its worst COVID-19 wave since the pandemic began. Health authorities have been monitoring travel patterns closely, with a particular focus on ensuring tourists stay safe by adhering to preventive measures such as mask-wearing and social distancing whenever necessary inside crowded venues or at checkpoints along popular routes between Beijing and Hebei's natural attractions.

"It is crucial for the health of our citizens that everyone continues their vigilance against COVID while enjoying themselves responsibly," said Jiang Hui, a senior official from China’s Ministry of Culture during Friday night press briefings about current developments in tourism trends and preventive strategies.

"Our priority is safety," said Shao Ling, spokesperson for Hebei Province Tourism Authority during a press conference on Saturday morning; she added that health protocol enforcement remains in place across all attractions with additional hygiene staff and facilities deployed to ensure proper implementation of rules at these sites.

Visitors are also being reminded about the importance of staying updated regarding local COVID-19 situations while visiting other areas, including regions like Inner Mongolia where cases continue rising after weeks without community transmission but with a growing outbreak in the capital Ulaanbaatar itself since last weekend. 

"We're taking every possible step to manage and contain these clusters effectively," said Tsegendorj Enkhbold, Director of Center for Disease Control at Mongolia National University on Monday as he addressed reporters about preventive measures being deployed in Ulaanbaatar; the city remains under a state of emergency with stricter rules enforced to limit gatherings and minimize movement between districts after confirmed cases jumped from just four last month, according to local authorities.

Despite fears that mounting travel demand could exacerbate COVID-19 transmission risks across the country's vast landscape of scenic destinations spread over several regions including Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region where outbreak is rampant, health experts assure visitors they are not alone in this shared responsibility. "We need to keep communication channels open so everyone can get accurate information about local COVID-19 situations," said Dr Lin Yangtian from the School of Public Health at Peking University on Tuesday during a panel discussion with other academics specialized in epidemiology and public health; he added that proper aw
