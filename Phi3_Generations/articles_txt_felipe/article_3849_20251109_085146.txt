Former NFL star Mike Bellion finds solace on college football field in Oklahoma
December 28, 2023 - Despite a lengthy career with the New England Patriots and stints at other teams that saw him win Super Bowl titles twice, former NFL great Mike Bellion says he's found his new home playing collegiate level football. "College life is about more than just winning; it’there're people here who care for you beyond your skills on the field," said Bellion during an interview last week at Oklahoma University (OU).
The 37-year-old arrived back in school late September, joining as a guest player before making his mark. He became part of OU's varsity team after showcasing exceptional talent and leadership qualities over the initial weeks on campus. Bellion is expected to join with more determination this coming season amid speculation that he might return full-time for what would be an alumni comeback bid in NCAA Division I football, a significant move considering his former status as one of college football's most decorated athletes.
In the 2019 collegiate game against rivals Texas Tech University where Bellion played key defensive roles that helped Oklahoma win by just ten points — an outcome he called "a dream come true," according to a university press release shared on their official Twitter account earlier this month, in which they stated OU would be honoring his exceptional contribution. The team will also name him as one of the honorary guests for their homecoming game against Texas Tech next weekend and during halftime festivities plan to pay tribute with a brief video montage highlighting key moments from Bellion's college football career, which included two national championships (2013 & 2014) as well.
Bellion started playing for OU in fall of '98 when he was recruited by then-head coach Bob Stoops and immediately took the spot at right guard after a trade from linebacker position helped solidify his skill set during an impressive sophomore campaign where he appeared on all but one playoff game. "He's been nothing short of remarkable here over nearly two decades," says OU legendary defensive lineman, Jeremy Smith (retired after 19 seasons with the Sooners), now a commentator for Fox Sports broadcasting college football matches nationally.
The veteran player quickly became an integral part to Stoops' successful defense while also excelling on special teams and earning first-team all-Big 12 honors in consecutive years (twice). The standout performances led him onto the NFL draft stage as well where he was picked third overall by New England Pats before transferring midseason during a contract dispute which ended up splitting Bellion's time between Tampa Bay Buccaneers and St. Louis Rams, according to ESPN stats records from his college days back in 2008 when the league saw him play more than half of season games with both teams combined (31/47).
Bellon went on a successful NFL career spanning eleven seasons which resulted not only championship wins but also three Pro Bowl selections. However, after announcing his retirement earlier this year at age 29 due to personal reasons and physical strain caused by years of professional play followed quickly in fall '17 when he enrolled back into university with hopes one day returning fully-time as a player under new head coach Bryan Brown'
