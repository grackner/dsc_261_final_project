A recent study published in 'Journal of Psychosocial Research' highlighted a growing concern over intimate partner violence during long-term isolation due to pandemic restrictions. The report found an alarming increase in cases where one partner was physically abusing the other, with social distancing measures believed by researchers to be exacerbating factors that go beyond normal stress levels experienced outside of such circumstances.

The study focused on data from New York City hospitals during a span starting March 2020 and ending in November last year – coinciding with the pandemic's peak restrictions, according to Dr. Sarah Thompson, lead researcher at Staten Island University Hospital. "We saw an unprecedented surge of abuse-related injuries among married couples or those living together," said Dr. Thompson during a televised press conference yesterday afternoon (February 25).

During lockdown periods in which families were confined within their homes, psychologists witnessed an uptick not only in physical abuse but also emotional and digital manipulation cases among relationships across the state of New York. A recent survey by 'The Couple's Clinic', a nonprofit organization specializing in marital therapy, indicated that up to 30% more individuals sought help for relationship issues during quarantine than before March last year when pandemic restrictions began.

Experts weighed-in on the phenomenon stating "When couples spend so much time together without external stimuli and are often cooped up in a small space, tensions can escalate rapidly," said Dr. Robert Chen, Associate Professor of Psychology at Brooklyn College during yesterday's interview with 'DailyMail'.

The study also noted an increase among younger populations between the ages 20-35 who seemed to face unique pressures from work and home life balance disrufortuation brought on by lockdown restrictions. "It is especially concerning for this demographic," added Dr. Chen, as many are still in their formative years of establishing relationships while dealing with financial insecurities due to the pandemic-induced economic uncertainty.

In light of these findings, New York state health officials have called on local authorities and community leaders across NYC to step up efforts by increasing accessibility for those seeking help through established hotlines or support groups in their respective communities (more details here). Dr. Thompson added "We cannot afford a backlogged crisis with an expected rise of domestic violence as states begin reopening."

The New York state health department has pledged to conduct further research on the subject by extending funding for additional studies that investigate factors such as mental illness, substance abuse or unemployment. The findings will contribute towards developing a targeted approach in providing appropriate resources and interventions at both individual levels and community-wide initiatives aimed at fostering healthier relationships during times of crisis situations like the ongoing pandemic (click here for more details).

Local hospitals are also taking measures to ensure prompt care by hiring additional staff, setting up designated areas where victims can receive immediate medical attention without fear and ensuring all protocols regarding patient confidentiality. "Our top priority remains offering a safe haven while maintaining proper precautions due to the pandemic," stated Dr. Thompson as she urged everyone seeking help for their loved ones not afraid anymore, but also reminded that abusers must understand these restrictions are in place and meant only for our collective safety
