EUROPEAN DESIGNER RAILS THE OPPOSITION AGAINST 'GARBAGE' STYLES THAT SMASHED SOME MEN’S FASHION IN JUNE. In a bold statement, the European fashion community issued an open letter condemning certain styles that were deemed unsafe and environmentally detrimental in June 2023. The designers expressed their concern regarding clothing items that rely heavily on fragile materials which have led to accidents where individuals sustained serious injuries upon tripping or falling due to improper footwear choices during fashion events across France, Italy, and Spain from late May through early June of this year.

The statement came after three separate incidents that resulted in hospital visits, with one unfortunate event occurring on May 27 during a fashion show at La Cigale theatre in Paris where a man tripped over delicate silk fabric and broke both his ankles.

“As creatives who are passionate about pushing boundaries within the industry while ensuring safety, we cannot sit idly by,” said Elise Martinet, president of French Fashion Association (FFA). “We have to take a stand for our craft.” The letter calls on fashion brands and show organizers across Europe to prioritize functionality and durability over purely artistic expression.

“There’s an ecological cost when we create pieces that are not meant to last,” said Roberto Ferrucci, Italian Fashion Institute president who added with a touch of urgency, “Fashion needs sustainable practices now more than ever.” The call for change has been echoed by environmental activists and healthcare professionals.

“If we continue down this path without addressing the safety concerns seriously, there will be consequences,” warned Dr. Luisa Gomez, a Spanish fashion critic turned orthopedist who witnessed several injuries firsthand during her time at Madrid Fashion Week earlier in June 2023. “The industry must evolve to prevent further harm.”

Mediators are now calling for stricter safety regulations and mandatory guidelin‌‌‌e­es on material use, footwear standards, and fallback designs at fashion events across Europe – hoping that these changes will inspire a new era of safe innovation in the European Fashion industry.
