It was an evening filled with anticipation at Madison Square Garden as "Game of Thrones" concluded its final two-hour episode on Sunday night in New York City and across the country on August 24th, just one year to the day since it began airing. The highly emotional ending brought together a global audience who tuned into HBO's flagship series for hours at end.

As millions watched from living rooms worldwide, "The Iron Throne" descended upon Manhattan amidst scenes of battles and betrayals that left audiences gripping their seats well past midnight when New York localized broadcast began airing on the network's main channel at 10pm.

Eliana Cohen, a die-hard "GoT" fan from Queens said she stayed up to watch for hours with her friends and family in an impromptu viewing party organized by fellow fans across Facebook groups who had planned their own localized screenings of the epic finale throughout New York State.

She admitted that while it was difficult not seeing loved ones or missing sleep, "I didn't want to miss a moment for anything else!" The series ended with Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryer joining forces against an ancient army led by Euron Greyjoy atop the Iron Throne itself. In one of many emotional scenes throughout Sunday night’s two hours, Samwell Tarly (played in seasons 6-8 by Gwendoline Christie) watched his brother Dylan's gruesome death from a distance as he fought valiantly to save King Robert for the sake of their city.

Aside from being one of television’s most successful series, "Game of Thrones" also left an indelible mark on pop culture over its eight seasons and beyond with countless merchandise items including t-shirts, mugs, action figures, posters - not to mention fan theories that continue decades later.

In a nod towards the show's cultural impact in New York City alone since it first premiered on HBO there over 10 years ago this month, an exhibition at MoMA PS1 – called 'The Game of Thrones: A Cultural Phenomenon', - is drawing hundreds to its doors. It features memorabilia items donated by fans like Cohen and original artwork inspired by the show’s storytelling universe crafted exclusively for this first-of-its kind exhibition in America, which runs until October 21st before heading West later this year.

CNN's Entertainment News contributor Sarah O'Brien comments on how it came to pass: "It is hard to imagine a more iconic series that has captured the imaginations and hearts of millions worldwide over its eight seasons-and well beyond." And despite being available for free streaming online post airing Sunday night, there were reports from many major cities across North America where people flocked en masse together in public spaces like parks or outdoor cinemas to relive their shared memories - all while awaiting next season’s renewal announcements which will be made later this year.

"There'll never cease to amaze me how deeply connected fans are with these stories," says fan theory blogger Ryan Mitchell from Los Angeles, who has hosted multiple online watch parties for viewers around the world while they await confirmation on whether or not there’s going to be a new season of "Game of Thron
