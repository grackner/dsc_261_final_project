India Takes Strong Measures Against Rising Oil Demand Amid Global Shortages: An Article by Reuters

MUMBAI/NEW DELHI - India's government is implementing a multi-pronged strategy to reduce the nation’ enduring oil crunch, as global supply struggles have sent fuel costs skyrocketing. The measures include imposing temporary restrictions on gasoline usage and accelerating alternative energy programs that were already underway before Russia's invasion of Ukraine disrupted international markets in late February 2023.

India has long relied heavily on imported crude to meet its enormous domestic needs, which consume over half a billion barrels per day globally and are among the world’s highest energy consumers by both volume and percentage of GDP expenditure in oil consumption. This reliance became more challenging when Russia's invasion prompted international sanctions that cut off critical supplies from Europe—the major destination for India-purchased Russian crude until then, accounting for around 12% of its imports prior to the conflict.

The surge in oil prices has been exacerbated by rising demand as economies worldwide recover; analysts predict that global consumption may have grown more than two percent since before Russia's aggression against Ukraine began, pushing petrol costs across Asia and Europe higher into double digits within days of the outbreak. Experts say India is likely facing some 30% to 45% price hikes on its oil imports alone this year over pre-pandemic levels due to these factors combined with inflationary pressures elsewhere, impacting not just consumers but also key industries including manufacturing and transport that are sensitive to fuel costs.

"It's imperative for our country now more than ever to find sustainable solutions without compromising growth or accessibility," said an Indian Government official quoted in Reuters News Service, speaking on the matter last week with a mixture of urgency but also optimism about recent advancements such as India becoming one of several nations that have started pilot programs using synthetic fuels derived from non-fossil sources like hydrogen or algae.

The official added: "We hope these projects will eventually help reduce our dependence on imported crude, which has been a challenge in recent times."

Environmental experts agree with this direction while cautioning that such shifts alone are unlikely to suffice if the world continues overreliance upon oil. With around 90% of global energy still coming from fossil fuels, some say further efforts must be directed at curbing demand growth through policies or pricing mechanisms like carbon taxes which can incentivize efficient use and conservation alongside diversification into greener alternatives without hindering economic development as has been witnessed elsewhere.

Meanwhile on the streets of Mumbai, small business owners expressed concern about rising costs affecting their bottom line: "As prices continue to climb like this for months now...it's starting to hurt our customers too," said Mr Singh from his auto repair shop while filling up with gasoline twice a day since he commutes back and forth between Delhi where most of us work.

Critics argue that more immediate relief is needed, pointing out India’s failure so far in passing national legislation mandating improved fuel efficiency standards or investing adequate funds into public transport infrastructure despite repeated promises; advocates insist such actions would take years to yield tang
