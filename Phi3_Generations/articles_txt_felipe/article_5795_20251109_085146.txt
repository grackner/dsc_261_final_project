Topic: Business - Pre-markets

A surge in retail sales and stock market optimism following President Biden's economic policy announcries have led to significant gains across pre-market trading on Wall Street this morning (Monday, February 15, 2024). As investors weigh the potential impact of sweeping reforms targeted at job creation and infrastructure spending unveiled last night by President Biden in Washington D.C., experts suggest that a wave of pre-market enthusiasm could herald strong performance throughout Tuesday's trading session, as reported by CNN Business Analyst Jordan Matthews on Wall Street ahead of the market bell.

In today's early hours before most Americans have even started their day and financial markets are closed to retail investors, bullish optimism has already driven a 1% uptick in Dow Jones futures while Nasdaq-adjusted stock index Futures (NDX) soared by more than 0.9%.

"We're seeing significant market movements ahead of tomorrow’s release of the presidential budget proposal, and we believe these gains may continue as investors digest President Biden's economic plans tonight," Matthews said in an interview with CNN Business analysts on Wall Street. "While it is too early to predict definitively how pre-market rallies translate into post market outcomes, the overall mood appears bullish as we look ahead."

The positive reaction has extended beyond technology stocks and shares of companies like Boeing Co., United Technologies Corp (UTC), Ford Motor Company, General Motors Corporation(GM) have all risen in pre-market action with gains between 0.3% to over 1%. In the energy sector specifically on CME Group's UG S&P Global Energy Futures Index, a gauge of futures contract prices for oil and natural gas components, it has surged nearly +2%, while gold trading in pre-market activity is flat or showing slight losses.

"President Biden’s plan emphasizes job creation with the goal to reduce unemployment rates significantly by next year," said labor economist Dr. Emily Taylor from Georgetown University, "This has provided a sense of security among investors that there will be more demand for goods and services."

Tuesday's presidential budget proposal is expected in the late afternoon session at 4:00PM EST following President Biden’s remarks on economic policy earlier today. The document, while still incomplete with estimates from some of its key figures not released yet ahead of Friday deadlines to Congress for appropriations and spending levels later next week, has nonetheless provided an indication as to what financial markets can expect over the coming years through Biden's administration efforts on investing in infrastructure projects.

"The fiscal approach is clear but its execution remains uncertain," commented Senior Analyst Michael Carter from JP Morgan Private Bank during his morning commute conversation with analysts along Wall Street, "We should keep an eye out for updates and revisions throughout the week ahead."
