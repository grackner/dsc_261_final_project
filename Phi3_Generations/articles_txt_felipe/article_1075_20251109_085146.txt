Astronomers celebrate as NASA's Mars rover successfully navigates treacherous terrain to uncover new evidence of water history on the Red Planet today during its fifth anniversary mission phase since touchdown in a Martian desert-like region called Jezero Crater on February 18, 2term.

The Curiosity rover has been exploring Mars for over five years now and continues to provide intriguing insights into the possibility of ancient life there – one piece at a time. The recent revelation by scientists from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is particularly exciting, as it could potentially rewrite our understanding of water activity on Mars in its earliest days.

Dr. Rebecca Greene, the lead investigator for Curiosity team at JPL said during a media conference yesterday that "the data collected today presents compelling evidence about Martian surface chemistry and past hydrothermal activities." She explained further: “The rover detected traces of hydrated minerals such as clay within sedimentary rocks in Jezero Crater. These are the first solid findings pointing to once wet habitats on Mars.”

Jezero crater, one of several ancient lakes believed to have dried up millions of years ago and covered by a thick layer of dust for eons before Curiosity set down near its rim last year was chosen as landing site based largely due its resemblance in geology with Earth's oldest preserved lakebed – Lake Huron. "We hoped we would find signs pointing to the presence or absence of water," said Dr. Greene, who has been leading a team that includes researchers from institutions across America and Europe on this mission which is managed by JPL for NASA in California.

As Curiosity begins its descent downhill today into an area known as 'Swiat Stijlp' (a nod to the Martian landscape resembling Earth’s own glacial valleys), scientists are eagerly studying data pouring in from their intrepid explorer who has been scouring Jezero Crater for signs of ancient life on Mars. Notably, Curiosity recently snapped a panoramic image that shows an 80-foot tall layered rock formation – believed to be sandstone deposited by water flow in the distant past which gives researchers hope there once might have been bodies of liquid water here billions of years ago on Mars.

“The rover has already made significant discoveries about conditions ancient Martian environment and possible habitability,” said Dr. Samantha Chen, a planetary scientist at MIT who is not affiliated with the mission but closely follows developments in Mars exploration efforts by NASA researchers around world which have been making great strides this last decade especially when it comes to unraveling our neighbor’s secrets about potential past life on Red Planet. “We're just scratching at surface, there is still much more exciting work ahead.”

Curiosity will keep collecting data for months or even years longer after landing as part of its extended mission which was set to run until it ran out fuel around 2020 but has been significantly delayed due in large measure by the global pandemic and funding uncertainty. NASA plans next big step - a second rover, Mars 2020 with Perseverance at helm – now slated for launch from Florida later this year which will continue exploration of Jezero Crater after Curiosity finishes scanning
