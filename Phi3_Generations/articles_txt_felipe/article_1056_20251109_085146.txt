Last night at London's Wembley Stadium, Chelsea faced Arsenal in a nail-biting match that ended with an early disqualification for the visiting team due to protests outside their home stadium sparked by prior on-field conduct. The unprecedented event took place during tonight’ end of season opener at 7:30 PM GMT, witnessed not only in person but also watched around the world through various media channels.

The confrontation began before even kickoff when members of Arsenal's fans gathered outside Chelsea training facilities to protest against a perceived bias by match officials during previous fixtures – leading these supporters, nicknamed 'the Red Army,' feeling disenfranchised and taking their anger on the pitch. This escalation culminated in an altercation between players after referee's decision that left one Chelsea player with a minor injury just before the start of play time at Wembley Stadium.

"This is not football, it’s violence," said David Moyes, head coach for Arsenal when asked about his team's behavior in light of their players protesting against perceived unfair treatment during prior matches leading to this incident on Saturday night. The Football Association (FA) had earlier declared that they would investigate the allegations made by Chelsea and consider possible disciplinary action if found valid – an announcement which only added fuel to fire for Arsenal fans, further inflaming their emotions ahead of tonight's match at Wembley Stadium.

Incidents such as these are not unheard-of in professional football; indeed they often occur during the build up period before a game – especially when clubs share historical rivalries like Chelsea and Arsenal, both having storied pasts with one another which go back decades. However, this was an extraordinary situation since it happened just hours after players from each side had participated in charity events together as part of the annual FA Cup celebrations – moments that should have brought joy to everyone involved but instead became catalysts for anger and confrontation on Saturday night at London's Wembley Stadium.

"I never thought I would see this kind of unrest happening between our clubs," commented Steve Walsh, a former player who currently works as an analyst for Sky Sports Football Channel while commenting about the unusual situation which occurred last evening during their match against Chelsea at London's Wembley Stadium. "We need to find ways that promote dialogue and understanding rather than fuel divisions."

Chairman Aleksandr Semukhin of Arsenal responded quickly on social media, apologizing for any unrest caused by fans but stood firm in his support towards the Chelsea team – declaring there should be no room for bigotry or hatred within football circles. "We respect our rivals and uphold fairness above all else," he wrote as thousands of miles away at Arsenal's Emirates Stadium, home fans were seen cheering on their players with pride regardless of the situation unfolding between two clubs they hold dear – proving just how deeply football can connect people across cultures.

Meanwhile refereeing officials are expected to meet shortly for discussions around improving safety protocols during games and ensuring fair treatment by stewards from opposing teams ahead of their meeting with both Chelsea's Director of Football, Gianfranco Zanchetta; who will be asked about disciplinary actions against his players - if any
