In a significant shift in consumer spending patterns, research firm TrendAnalytics revealed that online shopping is expected to surpass brick-and-mortar retail sales for the first time this holiday season due to ongoing pandemic restrictions and rising e-commerce adoption. The CEO of leading technology platform ShopStream commented in an interview with CNN Business, saying "We've seen a meteoric rise in digital marketps as shoppers look towards online options."

The trend has been noticeable over the past year but will reach its peak this holiday season. A spokesperson for Retail Association CEO said that they are monitoring these developments closely, noting "There's no doubt we're in uncharted territory here". This shift is driven by a combination of factors such as changing customer preferences and concerns about the spread of COVID-19.

Experts believe this change marks an important milestone for retail sector growth into e-commerce, with some predicting that physical stores will continue to decline even after restrictions are lifted due to entrenched consumer habits developed during lockdown periods. According to a study by MIT Economist Dr. Emily Zhao shared on CNN Business' website, "We anticipate the growth trajectory of online sales in 2021 and beyond will continue at an accelerated pace."

TrendAnalytics surveyed over one thousand consumers across five major cities – New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, and Phoenix from October to November. It reported that nearly two-thirds are now using digital platforms for shopping more frequently than they did pre-pandemic in the same period last year.

Shopper insights were further corroborated by witness statements collected at various e-commerce retailers, including online fashion store FashionFiesta’s Customer Service Manager, who told CNN Business that "The feedback we're hearing on our website is overwhelmingly positive with a growing number of customers preferring the convenience and safety of digital shopping."

While this rapid growth in e-commerce presents new opportunities for many businesses to expand their online presence and reach, others fear losing foot traffic that once brought life into downtown areas. In response to these concerns, New York City’s Department of Small Business Services announced a virtual workshop series aimed at helping traditional retailers navigate the digital transition with resources on topics such as e-commerce marketing strategies and logistics planning for online deliveries.

The rise in popularity of "Buy Local" campaigns has also seen an uptick, encouraging consumers to support neighborhood stores where they can contribute directly back into their communities while reducing carbon footprint through minimized transportation needs as part of a shift towards sustainable consumerism amid the ongoing pandemic.

The Retail Association CEO acknowledged these efforts and expressed hope that "This holiday season will not only redefine how we shop, but also provide fresh growth opportunities for our community businesses." As retailers brace themselves to face this new era of commerce where online stores dominate the shopping landscape while local physical shops continue their fight against extinction in an unprecedented fashion.
