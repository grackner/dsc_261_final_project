A fire broke out at an overcrowded nightclub in Berlin late Saturday evening that left three people dead and many injured as law enforcement officials responded to reports of panic ensuing among the partygoers inside a club called "The Warehouse." The inferno engulfed nearly half of the establishment located on Friedrichstraße, one of Europe's busiest streets in Berlin. Authorities confirmed at least five individuals were hospitalized with severe burn injuries and smoke inhalation issues by midday Sunday (Berlin time).

The fire ignited shortly after midnight when unidentified flares tossed around during a live DJ performance sparked the blaze, which quickly spread through crammed dance floors. The Warehouse has been known to host large-scale parties for years and is considered one of Berlin'selite nightlife spots.'"

As smoke billowed from second-story windows at around 1:30 AM local time last Saturday in Friedrichstraße, witnesses reported seeing people jumping out into the street frantically searching for an escape route. "I could hear screams and panic," said Alexandra Schmidt, a nearby resident who heard commotion while returning home from work.

Firefighters battling the blaze arrived at 1:45 AM to find heavy flames leaping through smoke-filled air as they hunted for potential escape routes amidst chaotic scenes of partygoers scrambling up stairs and down hallways toward emergency exits, with no time for instructions. Despite their efforts, many guests had already been evacuated from windows by individuals trapped inside unable to navigate through the smoke-filled air above ground level; this accounted for roughly 30% of all injured partygoers who were transported directly into hospitals following rescues performed throughout Sunday morning hours.

The Warehouse's reputation as a premier nightlife spot continued even after last Saturday's tragedy, with reports circulating that the club has since been reopening its doors under new management and is planning larger events within weeks – though no official announcement regarding such future plans could be confirmed. 

In response to this disaster, German Chancellor Angela Merkel issued a statement expressing shock at her country's nightclub scene being marred by violence: "Our vibrant and diverse culture should not become breeding grounds for tragedies like these...We must work together as a society towards safer living environments."

Local law enforcement officials have launched an investigation into the incident. Police Commissioner Jürgen Schäfke stated, "This is a sad chapter in Berlin's nightlife history; we will treat every piece of evidence with utmost seriousness to understand exactly what happened inside The Warehouse that fateful evening."

Affected family members have voiced their outrage and anguish at the loss: 'My father lost everything he had. Not a penny, not his friends... He left this world alone but for us.' stated Sophie Meyer-Petersen whose brother Andreas was among those killed in Saturday's tragedy before being rushed to Charité Hospital with serious injuries following evacuation from the club itself; she added that there must be consequences when people disregard safety concerns at large public gatherings.

Dr. Lena Kramer, Director of Emergency Services for Berlin Medical University (Ärztehochschule), stressed on Sunday how important it is to prioritize
