In a bustling city in Nigeria's southwestern region of Edo State on Friday afternoon, over two dozen individuals were rescued from submerged homes by emergency crews just hours before the imminent start of their rainy season. The townspeople had spent three consecutive days marooned as heavy downpours caused rivers and streams to swell beyond recognition since yesterday's extraordinary storm that swept across parts of Africa, delivering torrential rain in what meteorologists dubbed a once-in-a-century event.

As dusk fell on the floodplain village, local official Emeka Chukwu confirmed the rescue operation was well underway: "We have managed to evacuate all 135 residents from their homes thanks to joint efforts by our state'demergency services and community volunteers. We will continue working through the night until everyone is safe."

Having seen families forced out of their abodes, Amina Abubakar described her ordeal in poignant detail: "I lost everything - my homework on Friday morning; photographs that were to be passed down as family heirlooms. But we are grateful for the help and I hope this tragedy will bring about positive changes."

A UN spokesperson expressed concern, stating in a press release yesterday: "While Nigeria faces increasingly erratic weather patterns due to climate change impacts across Africa's Sahel region - it is of utmost importance that the international community continues to stand with those affected and support measures aimed at building resilience against future natural disaster risks."

A local engineer specializing in water management systems, Mr. Adebiyi Oladele commented yesterday: "Although we are taking steps like erecting flood embankments around key areas to mitigate similar crises in the future - there is an urgent need for continental partnerships and financial aid as a means of sustainable infrastructure development within this region."

Government officials have promised more significant investment into resilient urban planning while environmentalists stress education on climate change's impact. A local representative, Dr. Ikenna Okoye added: "The focus is not just about immediate response but ensuring that lessons learned here inform policies to combat the rising water levels caused by unpredictable weather patterns."

As of this morning, emergency crews continue their tireless work in providing shelter and aid as they await drier days. The international community has stepped up its support with humanitarian assistance already on route while Nigeria's government is reviewing disaster management protocol to ensure better preparation for future climatic challenges facing Africa’s vulnerable regions amidst escalating global climate change effects.
