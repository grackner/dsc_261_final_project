In a move that could transform Italy's culinary landscape, Naples has been chosen as one of the seven cities to receive funding from VisitBritain aimed at enhancing food tourism and cultural experiences for international travelers. The announcement was made today by Culture Minister Oliver Dowden during an event held in London on March 15th where he highlighted Naples' rich gastronomic heritage, hoping to attract more global culinary enthusiast end-users starting from next year through a comprehensive revitalization project that includes partnerships with local chefs and food establishments.


Naples boasts an abundance of world-famous dishes such as pizza Margherita and spaghetti alla Norma, yet it's the city’th daytime eateries - trattorie to locals – that tourists often miss out on due to their disconnect with mainstream culinary tours. This initiative aspires to bridge this gap by inviting travelers into Naples' daily life while indulging in authentic, home-cooked meals prepared using time-honored techniques passed down through generations of Neapolitan families and chefs alike.


"The essence of culinary tourism is not just tasting the food but understanding its roots," Minister Dowden said at today's press conference, "We want travelers to dive deep into Naples’ culture via our diverse local cuisine." 

Local councilor Maria Rossi further expressed that this initiative will enable visitors to truly experience Neapolitan living while also providing a significant economic boost. This comes after recent studies by the University of Naples, which suggest food tourism could potentially contribute up to €150 million annually if effectively harnessed and marketed within Italy’s broader travel sector.


The funding will be allocated towards creating immersive dining experiences with cooking classes led by local chefs demonstrating how Neapolitan cuisine has evolved over centuries, starting from sourcing the freshest ingredients at nearby farmers' markets to preparation and finally serving in a replica of authentic trattorias. These initiatives aim not just for travelers but also aspiring chefs globally - creating an exchange that extends beyond borders whilst celebrating shared culinary heritage.


Local businesses, such as 'La Tavola Felice', owner Giovanni De Luca expressed his excitement and readiness to be part of the transformation saying "Our restaurant will undergo changes in interior design along with a revised menu that highlights our original dishes which have roots deep-seated within Neapolitan traditions."


As for next steps, Culture Minister Dowden emphasized ongoing collaboration between local businesses and tourism bodies to ensure the project's success. "These funds are not just financial aid," he added. “They represent a commitment from VisitBritain in championing British culinary prowess globally."


The move has already garnered applause across various travel and food communities with online forums buzzing about the anticipated unique experience Naples could offer, promising an unforgettable blend of sightseeing and dining unlike any other city in Italy.
