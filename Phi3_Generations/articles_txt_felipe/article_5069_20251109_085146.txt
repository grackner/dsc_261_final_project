A fire ravaged a historic marketplace in Accra on Friday night, leading to significant property damage and prompting concerns over cultural heritage loss within Ghana's capital city. The blaze broke out around midnight at the Asylum Epoch Market near Osu Castle when vendors were packing up for the day after a small electrical fault ignited some discarded metal, according to local fire chief Samuel Kwame Mensah. Over 20 properties inside a narrow alley of buildings have been destroyed by flames that quickly spread due to Accra'in typical humidity and dense atmosphere which helps in rapid proliferation of fires here.

"This is not just any market, but one where many locals sell hand-crafted goods; hence the loss affects a vital part of our culture," said Lydia Akufo Ntiamoah, president of local artisans' council and an eyewitness to the fire.

Several emergency responders were battling against time after they arrived on-site following 911 calls reporting a 'blaze at hand'. The Ghana Fire Service’s Chief Officer, Kwesi Appiah led efforts in containing what he called an "unprecedented disaster". With the help of hundreds strong firefighting squad from various parts across Accra and some specialized equipment donated by local businesses for emergencies like this.

"All resources have been employed to douse these flames, with no signs yet showing total containment," said Chief Officer Appiah who estimates that several more hours of relentless work is needed before the firefighters can finally declare victory over a fierce inferno devastating lives and livelihoods alike.

While there's no official estimate yet for damages beyond property loss; many believe it will run into millions of dollars. The Ghana government has pledged full support towards aiding displaced artisans and rebuilding efforts, promising local communities their voices would be heard throughout the recovery process to help restore these unique treasures back with an even stronger resolve against such disasters in future.

In response to this recent calamity experts from Africa Heritage Watch have called for enhanced fire safety regulations within cultural sites across Ghana urging stricter enforcement of current laws and better emergency preparedness training for market vendors alike, warning that it's time all stakeholders take concrete actions to safeguard these invaluable aspects.

Local citizens have also started fundraising efforts under the hashtag #SaveAsylumEpoch on social media platforms calling upon people globally with Ghanaian roots and those interested deeply about world cultures, urging them not just to donate but share stories of their experiences at this historic marketplace as a means for global awareness.
