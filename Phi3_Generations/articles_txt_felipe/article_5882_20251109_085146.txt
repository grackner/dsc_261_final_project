Topic: Business - Pre-markets

Investors across Europe flocked to pre-market trading today as stock markets prepare for a volatile session ahead of next week's Cannes Film Festival results and the latest EU employment figures due out tomorrow morning, which are expected to show an unemployment rate hovering just above 9%.


The early rally was tempered by concerns over European Central Bank President Mario Draghi’semphasis on maintaining interest rates as he addresses Congress in Washington later this week. Investors fear that his remarks could further fuel market anxieties around inflation and the strength of the eurozone economy, particularly against a backdrop of political uncertainty after Brexit re-energized discussions about Scottish independence.


"As we approach key economic reports in Europe's most prominent markets this week, it is essential to keep an eye on both market sentiment and external influences that could sway precious metals like gold," said Michael Thompson, chief analyst at GoldWatch Services. "Investors seem a bit cautious today."


Early results in the United States have been positive as investors hope for similar performance across markets to counterbalance European anxieties with good economic news on US job growth expected tomorrow morning, which is projected at 175,000 new jobs created last month. The unemployment rate may decline from the current figure of over 9%, according to preliminary analysts' estimates cited by Reuters and MarketWatch.


In Europe today alone, shares in Paris were up with CAC futures rising as much as three percent before pulling back slightly while Frankfurt’s DAX opened down one-and-a-half points amidst the pre-market volatility. London's FTSE was mixed at a similar level of change on early trading open, reflecting unease among investors despite solid economic data in recent weeks from across industries including manufacturing and construction sectors within Europe itself.


Bloomberg News quoted European Commissioner for Economic Affairs Pierre Moscovici as saying that the "recent improvement of activity indicators does not justify optimism yet." He added, “We have to prepare ourselves more cautiously because external uncertainties remain.” 


Financial experts warned today's opening volatility may continue into actual market trading with some advisers suggesting a wait-and-see approach until EU employment figures are released and Draghi speaks at the US Congress. As for next steps, analysts recommend monitoring closely on both sides of the Atlantic as fresh data becomes available throughout this week.


"The real test will be how European markets react once concrete numbers from today's reports come out," said Sarah Jennings, senior market strategist at Efficient Markets Advisors LLC in London. "Investor sentiment is always a tricky one to navigate through these uncertain times."
