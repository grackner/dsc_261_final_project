Topic: Business - After-Hours

After a record-breaking fundraiser concluded late Tuesday night in New York City's financial district at One Wall Street Plaza, charity organizers announced that their event has raised over $20 million for local shelters and community programs throughout the area affected by recent hurricane season. The after-hours auction drew some of the most influential philanthropists from across New York City who gathered at a private residence in Midtown Manhattan, just steps away from Wall Street's iconic skyline.

"Our aim was to not only raise funds but also awareness for those still struggling," said Jane Doe, the event coordinator and CEO of Philanthropy First Inc., which hosted the gala fundraiser in partnership with renowned art galleries like The Metropolitan Museum of Art. Ms. Doe emphasized that their goal was to provide much-needed resources for community centers impacted by Hurricane Ida last September, as well as those facing financial hardships amid ongoing inflation and supply chain disruptions nationwide.

The star attraction at the event - a rare 17th-century portrait of Sir Isaac Newton held in trust with The Metropolitan Museum of Art – fetched an impressive $3 million bid, breaking previous auction records for charitable events in New York City and securing second place among all major fundraisers this year.

One anonymous attendee who contributed to the unprecedented success said she was inspired by Newton's work on scientific inquiry: "I wanted to contribute something that would make a difference, even if it's just through funds," shared Emily Stanton, an investment banker and longtime supporter of philanthropic initiatives.

Fundraising efforts were bolstered by other notable artworks on display at the evening event such as impressionist pieces from French artist Claude Monet that sold for over $2 million in total while a live auction featuring luxury cars donated to local families garnered nearly $10 million. 

The organizers announced last month how all proceeds will go directly towards community-based programs like educational initiatives, support groups and job placement assistance among others aiming at helping young adults in the area find their way back into employment or entrepreneurship while also offering recreational activities to bring together neighbors during these trying times.

"We are thrilled about this tremendous success but know there is still more work ahead," Doe added, as she urged others not just within New York City's elite circles but throughout the nation at large who have a desire for social change to step forward and make meaningful donations of their own.

Several local officials praised this generous fundraising effort on behalf of Philanthropy First Inc., including Mayor Bill De Blasio, Council Member Danny Dromard, as well the leader of NYC's Community Affairs Unit – all shared enthusiic support for their efforts to bring relief and renewal back into hard-hit neighborhoods.

"I want to personally thank Jane Doe and her team at Philanthropy First Inc. along with our city officials like Council Member Dromard, the Mayor of New York City, as well other philanthropists who joined us in this historic event," said NYC's Commissioner for Economic Development – Danielle Coulton-Nguyen during her speech on behalf of Philanthropy First
