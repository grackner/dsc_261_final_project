Jonathan Smith's bedtime routines have evolved over time; once a night of tossing and turning under bright streetlights with his window facing east in Chicago now sees the retired engineer embracing nature’s rhythms to ensure restful sleep, as recommended by recent studies. Experts say it could be one reason why Smith's mornings started feeling brighter lately.

Smith began noticing changes two years ago when he relocated from a bustling city life in downtner New York City for his children’s education and the tranquil suburbs of Evanston, Illinois – 12 miles northwest on Chicago's shores where evenings mellow into darkness by roughly 8:30 PM during winter months.

It was a surprising revelation to Smith when he discovered that his improved sleep patterns may well be tied not just to the new surroundings but also specific nighttime practices recommended in contemporary research on circadian rhythms and quality of rest, according to Dr. Helen Choi, an expert in chronobiology at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine, who was cited in his journey: "The body is attuned to natural light cycles as it relates to sleep-wake patterns."

Smith’s bedtime routine now includes spending 30 minutes under the sky just after sunset on weekdays and an hour during leisure days, which he credits with helping him establish a more robust circadian rhythm. As evidence of his positive experience: “I used to have trouble falling asleep until I started this routine,” Smith shared in our interview last month when we caught up over coffee at the local diner that has been serving patrons like himself for decades, just blocks away from where he now takes evening strolls.

The shift isn't lost on health professionals who understand how sunlight exposure impacts melatonin production – a hormone crucial to regulating sleepiness and wakefulness in humans. Dr. Choi continues: "By syncing our clock with the environment, we can optimize rest."

Dr. Samuel Levine, an Evanston-based psychiatrist who has been advocating for lifestyle changes as a complementary approach to traditional sleep therapies echoes Smith's experience stating that “an alignment of daily habits and biological processes is essential in achieving quality rest.”

Indeed research suggests around 70% of individuals with chronic insomnia improve their symptoms by integrating light exposure strategies into routines. However, while many appreciate the health benefits like increased alertness during waking hours or reduced stress levels over time — Smith simply finds peace in watching colors transform and fade away from his living room window each evening as dusk settles upon Chicago's skyline; a testament to how something so simple can hold immeasurable value.

Smith’s experience highlights the potential of nature-based therapies which are now increasingly recommended alongside medication or cognitive behavioral techniques, according to Dr. Levine: “They offer an accessible means for individuals seeking relief from sleep disorders.” As he walks past blooming tulips on his way back home at nightfall after a fulfilling stroll and feeling of tranquility in the face of daily life chaos – Smith can't help but smile. In these moments, all is right with him; an aspect perhaps not immediately measurable by conventional scientific means
