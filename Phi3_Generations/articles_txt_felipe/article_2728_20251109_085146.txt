In a move that could redefine its future role in European politics and security affairs, Finland has officially joined NATO as of Wednesday morning, March 12th. The decision to apply for membership was made during the Finnish government's meeting last summer when President Sauli Niinela raised concerns about Russia’ enduring threat post-Brexit era.

"This is a historic day not just for Finland but also Europe," said Minister of Foreign Affairs Pekka Haavisto, acknowledging NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg's commendation on the occasion during his visit to Helsinki earlier this week. "We believe that our collective strength will only grow stronger with nations like Finland standing united under NATO."

Finland has been a longstanding advocate of European Union integration and values-based cooperation in security matters, asserting its desire for transparency over threats from Russia while maintaining diplomatic relations. However, geopolitical shifts have seen the Baltic nation reconsider this position due to fears that NATO's focus might wane post Brexit and amid rising tensions with Moscow after it annexed Crimea in 2014.

"Finland is a responsible member of international community," remarked Ambassador Asko Kaila, who resigned his position within the Finnish mission to Germany last summer as he foresaw Finland joining NATO imminently during the country's election period on April 19th. "We need more security guarantees beyond our bilateral agreements with Russia."

Finland was expected to submit its application before May deadline set by US President Joe Biden and allies aiming for a bolstered transatlantic front against perceived threats, especially from the east as well. The nation's parliament will now convene on April 20th with discussions regarding Finland's NATO accession expected to dominate proceedings in an unprecedented political move that comes at a time of heightened tensions between Russia and several western nations over alleged election meddling, cyber attacks and military provocations.

Reactions from Moscow have been swift with Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stating on Wednesday: "It’s unacceptable that Finland is now seeking to join NATO because they are not our neighbors." Analyst Mats Rydén, a foreign affairs expert at the University of Gothenburg's Institute for Theoretical Studies and Peace Research added his views in an interview with Helsingin Sanomat: "It’ll likely heighten suspicions between Russia and Finland. However it could also bring about some diplomatic relief if NATO can effectively assure Finnish concerns over security."

As the dust settles on this landmark decision, European officials hope to expedite discussions for new members joining under Article 10 of the North Atlantic Treaty that allows nations with geographical proximity but without a military alliance relationship. Finland is expected to face scrutiny from other NATO countries regarding its posture towards Russia and assurances on avoiding provocative actions, in addition to addressing questions surrounding its defense spending which has been below the 2% of GDP target set by members for years now but committed to raise after joining.

"We understand Finland's strategic importance as we navigate through this complex global environment," said a NATO official during an emergency meeting in Brussels last night,
