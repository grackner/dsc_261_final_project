In a bold move to revolutionize transportation in urban areas across Europe, German startup E-Move unveiled their cutting-edge electric scooter on Thursday morning at the Frankfurt Motor Show. These innovative devices are expected to hit city streets by early next year and come equipped with safety features such as built-in lights and GPS tracking for enhanced rider security, reports CNN Money.

"The E-Move is not just a scooter; it's the future of urban mobility," said CEO Klaus Schmidt in an exclusive interview before the reveal at Frankfurt International Airport (FRA). "We aim to provide affordable and eco-friendly transportation that perfectly fits into European cities."

Set on wheels, with a top speed of 15 miles per hour and capable of covering up to 20 miles without recharging due to its advanced lithium-ion battery technology, the E-Move scooter is just one part of German firm'thy commitment towards sustainable travel.

Germany has a long history with cycling as primary means for getting around within cities and towns but it seems that motorized personal vehicles are starting to take over this tradition according to recent studies by the Deutsche Verkehrswacht (German Transport Association). The DVA predicts an increase of nearly 20% in road traffic from last year, largely due to a rise in private car usage.

"It's time for change," Schmidt affirmed during his interview with CNN Money at FRA. "European cities have been designed around cars and now is the perfect opportunity that we should adapt our infrastructure back towards prioritizing people over vehicles."

E-Move scooters are being developed to help bridge this gap between traditionally pedestrian areas of Europe, with their compact design allowing them seamlessly integrate into crowded public spaces without disrupting daily life as much. The startup also claims these EVs will encourage people who might otherwise avoid exercise or walking due to distance and time constraints in cities like Berlin, Munich or Hamburg - a claim backed by studies showing an average commuter spends nearly 1 hour per day traveling within city limits alone when using private vehicles.

During the press conference at FRA, Schmidt further addressed this issue: "With our technology we want to bring people closer together while cutting down on pollution and traffic congestion." He hopes his company's innovation will make commuting less of a chore for city dwellers in Europe by giving them another affordable option.

Experts from the Frankfurt Institute of Technology (FIT) say they are already working closely with E-Move to create optimal infrastructural design changes required around cities across Germany as part of this initiative - suggesting that more than just scooter sharing may lie ahead for German commuters in their bid towards greener commuting options.

"The future needs sustainable, affordable and safe modes of transportation which are not limited by geography," says Prof. Hans Müller from FIT to CNN Money at the same event where he discussed his research on adapting city infrastructure for non-motorized vehicles like e-scooters alongside EV cars that require charging stations in place around cities instead of parking lots dominated by gasoline powered cars."

"If we could make one change to our public transportation system, I would want electric scooters implemented everywhere with safe lanes dedicated exclusively for them," says Dr.
