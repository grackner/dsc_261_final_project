A major earthquake struck Tokyo on Friday evening at precisely 6:45 PM local time with a preliminary magnitude of 7.3 according to early reports from the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). The quake was felt across multiple regions, prompting immediate reactions and evacuations as residents sought safety in their homes or public shelters.

Mitsuaki Tanaka, an official with Tokyo's Emergency Management Bureau, stated during a press conference that the tremors were "both powerful and sudden," causing alarm amongst city dwellers who had become accustomed to seismic activity given Japan’in location in one of the world's most active earthquake zones.

"As soon as we felt it shaking, we immediately ordered everyone within our jurisdiction to evacuate from any buildings that might pose a risk," Tanaka said. "We will be closely monitoring aftershock activity and ensuring people can return safely."

Local police chief Hiroyuki Sato commented on the disruption caused in Tokyo's bustling metropolis, noting many residents had been evacuated from high-rise buildings to temporary shelters. "It was a jarring wakeup call for some," said Chief Sato during his daily briefing with officials and reporters at city hall later that night.

The Japanese Red Cross has begun mobilizing its disaster response teams, preparing emergency supplies such as water purification tablets, blankets, first aid kits, along with food packs for those who had to evacuate their homes temporarily due to potential structural damage and ongoing aftershock activity.

Experts at the National Disaster Prevention Agency expressed concern about possible secondary hazards in addition to shaking-induced injuries from falling objects, broken glassware or even landslides triggered by heavy rains this weekend forecasted for parts of Japan's main island, Honshu.

"A major quake like today can lead not only to immediate damages but also long term implications on infrastructure and economy," remarked an agency spokesperson during a televised interview earlier in the day before disaster struck Tokyo Friday evening at 6:45 PM local time when magnitude-7.3 earthquake rocked Japan's bustling metropolis, bringing fear among its nearly 14 million residents who are no strangers to seismic activity given their nation’s geography in one of the world's most active tectonic zones."

In an emotional interview with a resident affected by today's disaster-like event: "I felt it coming straight from my heart," said Yumi Suzuki, 34. Her family was forced to evacuate their home in Shinjuku ward amid the crisis and anxiety of aftershock activity that continued throughout the night into Saturday morning as predicted by seismologists nationwide who have been monitoring tremors since yesterday afternoon when smaller quakes started jolting Tokyo’s residents.

"We're just trying to remain calm, doing our best amidst all this turmoil," said Suzuki during an interview with a local TV station after she returned from her temporary accommodation where fellow evacuees were sharing stories of fear and uncertainty overnight as they awaited their homes’ structural assessments post-quake.
