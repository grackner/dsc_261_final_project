A magnitude-6 earthquake struck near Rome late Thursday evening, causing widespstatic concern and prompting immediate emergency response efforts throughout Italy's capital region as well as neighboring areas of Lazio. The quake was first felt at around 7:52 PM local time with its epicenter just outside the bustling city center. Italian authorities have confirmed that two buildings sustained major damage and there are numerous reports from eyewitnesses about collapsed structures on Via Colosanto, a main thoroughfare in Rome's working-class district of Testaccio where several commercial outlets were located. 

Reports suggest the tremor triggered panic among locals who rushed outside their homes and offices amidst strong aftershocks that followed within minutes as seismologists predict more shaking to come overnight into Friday morning, which could exacerbate existing damages in some parts of the region. 

"I felt my entire apartment tremble like never before," said Maria Rossi (not her real name), who works at one of Testaccio's small businesses as an accountant and has lived there for over twenty years, recalling how she saw pictures on social media with debris scattered across the sidewalk after last night’s temblor. "It was terrifying to see things falling apart right before my eyes."
 
"This is our first experience dealing directly with such an intense earthquake," remarked Mayor Francesco Mancini, who has been coordinating Italy's response efforts since the initial shock struck and working tirelessly throughout Thursday night. "We have emergency personnel on standby to support affected areas." 
 
He also addressed concerns about structural damage in Rome during a press conference this morning: “The city council will conduct immediate inspections of all buildings, particularly those older or vulnerable constructions that are typically located near the historic center and along main roads such as Via Colosanto. Our priority is to ensure public safety before any further repairs can take place."
 
Meanwhile, local non-profit organizations have been activated for relief efforts while a small team of geologists from Italy's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV) will continue their monitoring activities. Residents are advised to stay indoors during aftershock activity as well maintain vigilance over property damage outside your immediate dwelling area, especially in Testaccio where the quake hit hardest near commercial areas frequented by tourists and locals alike on busy weekends for shopping or dining.
 
As of this writing (Friday morning), there have been two additional aftershocks felt throughout Rome since early Thursday night with magnitudes recorded at M3.8 as per INGV’s latest data released today; experts are urging people to remain calm and patient while authorities conduct further investigations into the extent of this earthquake's impact on both private homes & commercial buildings across all parts Rome, particularly along Via Colosanto where multiple businesses were operating prior.
 
As we await more updates from seismologists who continue their round-the-clock monitoring activities through Saturday morning; one thing is certain: Italy will come together as a nation in the wake of this natural disaster to support its affected citizens and communities across every province, including Rome where they are already starting preparations for tomorrow's daylight commute after spending many hours working late into
