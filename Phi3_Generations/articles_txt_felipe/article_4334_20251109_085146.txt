A major fire broke out in a crowded five-story building at approximately 4 p.m. local time on Wednesday near Delhi's financial district of Gurgaon. The blaze engulfed three floors, with confirmed evacuations taking place as emergency services battled to contain the flames before sunset.

The fire began in a third-floor residential unit and quickly spread through the building’ end rooms due to old electrical wiring that sparked at around 3:45 p.m., according to Haryana Fire Service officials who arrived on scene within minutes of receiving an urgent call about potential casualties after residents reported smoke coming from several apartments below their owns, said Superintendent Ajay Singh Rajput in a press briefing Thursday morning.

"We were initially concerned because we received reports that multiple families had been displaced by the fire," added Chief Inspector Anand Kumar as he stood near an evacuation site on East MG Road, where survivors awaited assistance from Red Cross volunteers and family members who arrived shortly after midnight. "Our priority was to ensure everyone's safety."

The Haryana Fire Service estimated that at least 50 people may have been in the building when smoke alarms started going off on Tuesday afternoon, but so far no one has reported missing or injured since evacuations began last night. Residents said they were shocked to see their belongings ruined and left homeless after a fire broke out just 45 minutes from closing time at the building's co-op owned by Haryana State Co-operative Societies Development Society Ltd, where over ten families live on each floor in two-bedroom apartments with shared kitchens.

The cause of Wednesday afternoon’s blaze remains under investigation but initial findings indicate it was most likely electrical wiring or faulty appliances that sparked the fire rather than any other source, said Rajput during Thursday's press conference held at a nearby office complex with representatives from local administration and community leaders present.

"We found evidence of overloading on two circuits in common areas like hallways," added Chief Inspector Kumar after reviewing the fire scene report put together by Haryana State Electrical Inspectors Association, who visited later yesterday evening to assess how unsafe wiring may have contributed to this incident. "I know it's devastating for so many families here but we are working on ways they can rebuild or find temporary shelter."

Gurgaon Mayor Sunita Narain condemned the fire as tragic and called upon all city residents, particularly those living in older buildings with potential safety hazards like faulty wiring to have their electrical systems thoroughly checked before Christmas. In a statement released Wednesday night alongside local leaders from both government-owned housing projects and cooperative societies such as the one affected by today’s fire tragedy, she urged citizens across Gurgaon not just to securely manage personal appliances but also pay attention when neighbors display signs of smoke or electrical sparking.

"We need everyone in our community working together for a safer environment," said Narain who promised action against companies found responsible if their equipment is deemed as faulty during her office's routine inspections carried out on Thursday morning, with assistance from local fire officials at various locations around Gurgaon.
