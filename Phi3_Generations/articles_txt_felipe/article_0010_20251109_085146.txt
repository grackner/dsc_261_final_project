An explosion rocked a downtown office building in New York City late Tuesday evening, causing partial evacuation and extensive property damage but fortunately sparing any injuries to individuals inside the workplace at Broad Avenue Tower during business hours. According to eyewitness reports from employees still on-site post-evacuation order as of 8 p.m., a series of small charges triggered by an unknown source detonated in separate offices within the structure, located directly across Union Square Park near major financial districts.

Security personnel and emergency responders are currently investigating after several blasts were reported around 7:45 pm local time that have since been contained following multiple explosions throughout Tuesday evening into early Wednesday morning. The office building is owned by conglomerate corporation Global Dynamics, with operations spanning financial services and international trade across the tri-state area.

Jennifer Smythe, a security manager present during the incident at 7:30 pm who now serves as first responder team lead onsite said, "We immediately went into lockdown protocols when we heard commotion outside our doors; everyone was instructed to shelter in place." A few blocks away inside Union Square Park's cafe and ice cream shop owners reported unusual noises just before 7:45 pm but nothing that looked or sounded like an explosion.

Local law enforcement authorities are asking anyone with relevant information regarding the incidents to come forward, as Global Dynamics continues business operations after evacuation protocols were lifted at around 8 p.m., and employees began their return back into work spaces throughout Broad Avenue Tower later this evening under heightened security measures including additional metal detectors in all entrances and exit points along with increased surveillance cameras covering the entire perimeter of both buildings – offices above, retail space below-and pedestrian traffic patterns near Union Square Park as well.

Investigators are examining CCTV footage from nearby businesses for possible suspects or suspicious activities leading up to Tuesday evening's events while all employees will remain on mandatory leave until safety assessments by certified engineers and bomb technicians have been completed, expected over the next few days. "I hope that this incident serves as a wake-up call for better security measures in our offices," commented Global Dynamics CEO Gregory Hines after returning to his temporary workspace at an offsite location yesterday afternoon following companywide evacuation orders which were only issued shortly before noon when multiple reports of blasts within Broad Avenue Tower began flooding into headquarters.

The financial services division, with its 50 full-time staff and numerous contractors working across the city who are now returning back to work on Wednesday morning under enhanced security protocols after hours evacuation that lasted nearly ten minutes longer than expected due primarily because of initial communication issues between employees inside Broad Avenue Tower as well police sirens echoing throughout Lower Manhattan which could be heard distinctly within the office building during evening traffic rush hour when many businesses closed prior to this morning's events; a reminder that while Global Dynamics is best known for its financial services and international trade operations across three states, it remains committed to providing safety measures necessary for staff members returning back into workspaces tomorrow after assessments have been completed.

"We cannot underestimate the importance of maintaining robust security protocols at all times," said Police Chief James Thompson who emphasized heightened police presence
