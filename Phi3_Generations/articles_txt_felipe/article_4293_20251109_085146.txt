A local food festival in New Orleans was recently hit by a mysterious outbreak of seafood-related illnesses that has left authorities and restaurant owners scrambling to identify the source. As health officials race against time, investigators have traced cases back to popular establishments around Bourbon Street from last weekend's celebration on Saturday night when nearly 200 people fell sick with symptoms ranging from mild nausea to severe vomiting and diarrhea after consuming shellfish.

The Louisiana Department of Health confirmed that the outbreak was caused by norovirus, a highly contagious virus commonly associated with foodborne illnesses such as salmonella or E-coli bacteria but rarely linked directly to seafood consumption itself since those pathogens typically enter through undercooked meat. However, local health officials believe the close proximity of festival attendees may have facilitated rapid transmission amongst them while they were sampling various dishes offered by food vendors lining Bourbon Street on Saturday nighttime.

"Foodborne illness outbreaks are always concerning," said Dr. Lillian Patterson, Louisiana State Epidemiologist at the Department of Health and Hospitala in Baton Rouge while speaking to CNN about the current situation here amid a growing number of cases across several states within our region over just two weeks ago - that's when this all started," she added.

As investigations continue, initial findings from health officials indicate improper hygiene practices among food handlers at some festival vendors could be responsible for cross-contamination; however no conclusive evidence points towards any specific vendor or shellfish source yet. "We're still in the early stages of our investigation," Dr. Patterson emphasized, but she assured that stringent measures were being put into place to contain and prevent further spread - including quarantine protocols for affected individuals who had attended the festival over the weekend while advising others on proper food safety practices going forward."

Eateries specializing in shellfish are notably shaken by these developments with several owners voicing concern about their businesses' reputations being potentially tarnished due to this unfortunate incident. "We have always been proud of our reputation for serving delicious seafood dishes and taking care that they meet health codes, but now we find ourselves in a difficult position," said the owner of 'Bayou Bites', who wishes anonymity given the sensitive nature of ongoing investigations surrounding their establishment.

The New Orleans Food & Drink Board is closely monitoring this outbreak while working hand-in-hand with local businesses and health authorities to swiftly implement necessary steps, including enhancing food safety regulations within festival events as well reinforcing vendor training programs for proper hygiene practices amidst preparations already underway towards hosting another annual celebration.

With 13 confirmed cases across various states since Sunday evening when the first symptoms began manifesting themselves and multiple other suspected instances reported by concerned citizens calling into local health departments daily, it remains uncertain if this seasonal festival in New Orleans will survive unscathed or be forever marked as a cautionary tale that prompted significant changes to prevent similar occurrences within future events.

Quotes from at least two other witnesses add depth and perspective: "I felt fine until I got home, but the next morning after breakfast (and realizing others had fallen ill too), my wife said something about
