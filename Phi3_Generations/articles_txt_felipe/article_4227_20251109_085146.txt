In a groundbredependent clinical trial set to commence this month at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, researchers are evaluating an experimental treatment for chronic migraines—a condition that affects millions of people each year but has no FDA-approved treatments. This novel approach promises hope as one of the most debilitating conditions among patients struggles to find relief without harmful medication side effects or addiction risks associated with common painkillers like opioids.

Sarah Thompson, a 42-year-old migraine sufferer from Rockville who frequently misses work due to her debilitating headaches says "I'm excited and hopeful about this trial; it could be the answer I have been searching for." Researchers are testing whether transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can disrupt abnormal brain activity associated with chronic migraines.

"Our goal is to alleviate pain without drugs, which often bring their own set of side effects or risks," says Dr. Emily Parker from the Department of Neurology at Johns Hopkins Hospital who heads up this study focusing on TMS for chronic migraines treatment where 20 patients will undergo weekly sessions during a six-month trial period, starting next month and continuing until December when results are analyzed.

For the past year, Thompson had tried various prescription medications to manage her condition with minimal success or significant side effects; opioid usage made it difficult for her husband, Daniels, as an active construction worker not only affected his concentration on-site but also caused dizziness and fatigue that took time away from their family life. "I see my wife in constant pain every day of the week," he says with a sigh.

"Migraines are common yet complex neurological disorders which can impair many aspects of daily living, including relationships between partners like us and our two teenage kids back home." Daniels adds as his wife's constant headaches have made their time together less enjoyable than it could be.

Chronic migraines typically last for more than 15 days per month over a three-month period, significantly impairing sufferers' lives according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS). The American Migraine Foundation reports that approximately one in four Americans will experience these debilitating headaches at least once yearly.

"Migraines are complex, with multiple factors contributing to their development," explains Dr. Parker who adds TMS targets the temporal lobe of your brain where migraines start by producing a safe magnetic pulse that activates specific areas responsible for pain relief without affecting other parts of the mind."TMS treatment has been effective in treating depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder, so we hypothesized it could be successful here too," adds Dr. Parker.

If TMS proves to alleviate migraine sufferers' pain effectively through non-invasive methods while avoiding side effects associated with current treatments like opioids or antidepressants used in prescription, the Johns Hopkins Hospital trial could revolutionize how we approach treating chronic headaches.

"I hope this research finds an answer for those who suffer every day," says Thompson as she waits to begin her first TMS treatment next month along with 19 other participants chosen from a diverse group
