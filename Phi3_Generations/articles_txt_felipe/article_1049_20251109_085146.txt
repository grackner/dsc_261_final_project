In downtown Chicago on March 15th, architectural enthusiast Sarah Johnson found a striking discovery in front of The Art Institute – what appeared to be an intricately designed vintage poster from the early 20th century. Upon closer examination and consultation with historical experts at local universities, it seems that she has stumbled upon one of only two known original pieces by famed artist Edward Kline (1896-1974), who left no record in his catalogues or personal papers regarding this work's creation.

Sarah Johnson recounted the moment: "I was just browsing through a thrift store, and I saw something on one of their walls that drew my eye—it looked old but undoubtedly well-preserved." She immediately took it down to examine its authenticity more closely at home. It wasn't until she noticed subtle signature flourishes in the artwork’s border design – reminiscent yet distinct from Kline's typical style found on other pieces of his work, that Sarah sought professional help.

"Finding a piece by Edward Kline is like finding buried treasure for any collector," says Dr. Harold Weissman, curator at the Chicago Historical Society who specializes in early 20th-century artworks but has never personally seen this particular poster before its recent discovery on Sarah's living room wall. "To add to it being a vintage Kline work is phenomenal given that they were produced en masse and not one was known until now."

The Society, with assistance from the Chicago Art Institute where many of his works are prominently displayed today, will be examining further details on Sarah's poster next month. A carbon dating process has tentatively dated it back to around 1925-30. "It’s a bit like reuniting long-lost family heirlooms," remarks Dr. Weissman about the potential historical significance of this find, adding that authenticity will be confirmed through chemical analysis and forensic artistry techniques over these upcoming weeks.

The Johnson residence now finds itself at an unforeseen intersection between living quarters and a valuable piece of cultural history; while Sarah remains in disbelief regarding the discovery: "I'm still trying to wrap my head around it – how could I have missed this artwork all along?" she says, before adding with amusement. “Now that we know what’s on our wall, we can actually enjoy a real piece of history right here at home.”

As for the poster itself: experts are eager to learn more about its unique style and possible inspirations behind Kline's work during this period as it could provide new insights into his artistic progression. It stands alone in Sarah’s collection, yet awaits peer validation that will hopefully confirm her find within weeks – an unexpected journey from home decoration to significant historical artifact for Chicagoans and the wider world of architecture aficionados alike.
