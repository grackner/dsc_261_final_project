In a remarkable display of animal intelligence and problem-solving skills observed by scientists worldwide, five clever capuchin monkeys in Rio de Janeiro have successfully used sticks to obtain food from their enclosure at the city's renowned zoo on Monday. This behavioral feat was witnessed near Zoo Vila Militar as one of Brazil’ran exceptionally observant primate enthusiasts, Mr. Carlos Silva, shares his excitement over the development: "I never thought I would see monkeys using tools like this in my life!"

Dr. Maria Fernandes-Santos, an expert on animal behavior at local university and a leading authority on capuchin studies has spoken to CNN about her team's observations from their permanent research station inside the zoo: "It was quite astonishing when I saw these monkeys fashioning makeshift tools out of twigs or other available objects. This level of intelligence is not typically seen in wild populations."

The capuchin community at Zoo Vila Militar, which has become a hotspot for primatologists and animal lovers alike since their arrival two years ago from Brazilian rainforests where they live with relative solitude before being relocated to the city zoo. With only five monkeys left in captivity after some of them went missing without any trace during transit, these survivors are quickly adapting back into a more complex social structure and exhibiting new behaviors that indicate higher cognition levels than expected for their species typically seen at zoological parks worldwide.

This intriguing development has also caught the attention of Professor Alexandra Petrova from Moscow State University, who specializes in animal intelligence: "The fact these capuchin monkeys are using tools to retrieve food speaks volumes about how intelligent they truly are and their ability for adaptability." She added that it's crucial now more than ever to ensure the animals continue being studied closely since such unexpected occurrences could signal larger trends within primate intelligence research.

Zookeepers at Vila Militar have reportedly started documenting these behaviors, which has led to discussions about modifying enclosure designs and expanding educational opportunities for visitors who might get enthralled by the monkeys' ingenuity as they learn more intricate facts such how capuchin populations can exhibit remarkable cognitive skills even when confined in captivity environments.

The Zoo Director, Mrs. Julia Ribeiro confirms: "We are closely monitoring these developments and will take appropriate steps to ensure the animals' welfare while also leveraging this opportunity for public education on primate intelligence." 

For now though, visitors throng to viewing areas hoping they get a glimpse of one of Brazil’s capuchin celebrities demonstrating their astounding tool usage abilities once again.
