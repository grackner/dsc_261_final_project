A college football game turned chaotic last Saturday when a player allegedly assaulted an opposing team's coach on North Carolina State University' extramural field in Raleigh at halftime of the NC State Wolfpack vs. Duke Blue Devils match, witnesses said. A crowd estimated to be around 150 people watched as what seemed like a benign interaction between players from both sides quickly escalated into an unexpected physical confrontation after one player allegedly threw a punch without prior intent of harming the coach, reports CNN in this breaking news report about college football drama.

"I saw it all unfold before my eyes," said Rachel Smith, 19, who was at her grandparents' house to cheer on Duke University during their homecoming game against NC State last Saturday afternoon around 2 p.m., local time when the confrontation occurred as she described what transpired between two NC State players and a Duke coach after halftime before walking out into an uncivilized mob demanding justice for her grandfather's friend who was involved, reports CNN in this breaking news report about college football drama.

According to Smith’s recount of the incident shared with local authorities during their investigation on Monday morning at North Carolina State University where NC State coach Dave Doeren and Duke coach David Cutcliffe met for an informal interview after halftime before returning, reports CNN in this breaking news report about college football drama.

“It’s unfortunate that these things can happen even within the sport we all love,” said John Williams, a long-time North Carolina State University sports fan and former player during Smith's grandparents house visit when she was telling her story to friends who had gathered for Saturday night’s Duke homecoming party.

Smith told local authorities that as NC State players entered the field with their coach after halftime, one of them approached a friendly conversation between Cutcliffe and his former Wolfpack teammates before throwing himself at another player from North Carolina State who happened to be standing nearby without warning or apparent motive. The confrontation quickly escalated as NC State players rushed in with roars that echoed throughout the field, leading one Duke fan’s father being physically pushed out of sight by a determined and confused crowd while Cutcliffe was trying his best not to panic amidst all these chaos-filled events unfolding before him.

“At first, it looked like just friendly play between players from both sides,” said Smith as the NC State coach tried calming down after being dragged off by a few of Duke fans during her grandparents’ homecoming party where she had been invited to celebrate with family and friends on Saturday evening when North Carolina State University hosted an important college football game against Duke Blue Devils in Raleigh, reports CNN.

“But things got heated up after one NC State player went for the other duke student,” said Smith while continuing her story about how events unfolded as she looked around to find family and friends who were just watching on in stunned silence at witness accounts of a confrontation that turned into physical violence against two college players during an important game between Duke University, NC State, where both coaches would not be able leave the field for safety reasons.

“I remember yelling out to my parents and grandparents as they started leaving with friends,” said Smith about how emotions ran high among family members in witness accounts of confrontation that unfolded before them on Saturday afternoon at their North Carolina home during
