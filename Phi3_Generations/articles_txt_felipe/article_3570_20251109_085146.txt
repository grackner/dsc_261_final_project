A powerful winter storm blanketing Texas with snow has knocked out power and disrupted everyday life for millions of residents overnight on February 14th in what is shaping up to be one of the most severe weather events this state had experienced in years. According to reports, as much as two feet (60cm) of fresh powder accumulated across Dallas-Fort Worth and surrounding areas within a mere six hours after blizzard conditions began last night around 10pm local time when temperatures hovered just above freezing point at -2°C.

"Our community is resilient, but this storm has truly tested our ability to stay strong in the face of adversity," Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson said during an evening press conference held earlier today with other city officials present including Chief Deputy Mayor Carol Ruth Silverstein and City Manager Tara Dennehy. "We are working tirelessly around-thein round-theclock efforts towards clearing roads, restoring power supplies while keeping public safety paramount."

The National Weather Service issued a Winter Storm Warning for North Texas as the snowfall intensified throughout most of Friday night leading to widespread travel disruptions and even closures across Dallas County. In one incident alone at Greenleaf Parkway near Keller, more than 50 vehicles were stranded after being buried under several feet of accumulated slush within a matter hours as traffic came to complete halt with no alternate routes left open due for the duration throughout Saturday morning until mid-afternoon when some partial restorations could take place.

As frigid winds blew down from Canada, they brought freezing rain along which led officials in Austin to issue an icy/freezing advisory between Friday night and early Monday afternoon with temperatures falling below zero Fahrenheit (-17 degrees Celsius) expected across the state overnight into Saturday morning. In response, Gov.

Throughout Saturday afternoon, localized thaws began allowing residents within the impacted areas access back into their homes starting with some limited clearings along major thoroughfares after heavy snow plowing crews had cleared as much accumulated slush and ice away from key roadways throughout Friday night until early morning hours. However despite these efforts more than 45,000 outages remain reported statewide by power company Oncor with approximately half of those residing in Dallas County alone experiencing complete loss overnight amid the raging winter storm as wells ongoing snowfall continues to plague residents across much larger parts Texas beyond DFW metroplex including Austin where temperatures have dipped below freezing since last Friday afternoon.

Emergency services personnel working through both days continued their efforts towards restoring electricity alongside other utilities like water companies while also coordinating snow plow operations as wells providing emergency shelters for stranded individuals forced indoors by the harsh weather conditions at-risk of being without power and heat indefinitely until full recovery can be made across multiple areas severely affected. Local meteorologists have warned that more heavy rainfall is expected this evening which could further exacerbate existing ground saturation resulting from
