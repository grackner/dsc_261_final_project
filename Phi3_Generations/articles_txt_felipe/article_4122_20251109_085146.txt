Topic: World - Europe

A powerful blizzard blanketed parts of Northern Italy and France last weekend as temperatures plummeted to record lows in February for both countries — a stark reminder that Europe is not immune to severe winter weather despite global warming trends, reports the CNN. The extreme cold wave affected millions across two major European nations from Saturday night into Sunday morning when unprecedent snowfall and bitterly freezing winds hit regions like Piedmont in Italy's northwest as well as Brittany in France to the west of Paris.

Experts at AccuWeather note that this is one of the most severe early winter storm events Europe has witnessed for decades, with blizzard conditions spreading across large swathes of Northern and Eastern Italy on Saturday night into Sunday morning (02/18-02/19). "Overnight temperatures plunged to 5 degrees Celsius in Milan. Strong winds made it feel like minus 20 or more," explains meteorologist John Smith at AccuWeather, who adds that the weather was a significant deviation from normal February conditions with warmer and milder than average days being typical for Europe during this time of year (average high temperature in Northern Italy is usually around 13 degrees Celsius).

Milan saw about two feet of snow accumulation on Saturday night while smaller towns like Turin, which lies just an hour's drive from Milan to the south-east experienced a foot and half as well. "It felt so different...the first time I woke up in my living room with inches deepening every day," shares resident Maria Bianchi recalling her experience of being snowed into their home for almost two days, per DailyMail reports (02/18-02/20).

Piedmont Region officials issued a State of Emergency last Sunday and asked citizens to stay indoors during the harshest conditions while transport services were limited. As if Italy was not hard enough hit by snowfall in northern areas, France's Midi-Pyrenees region faced similar impact with about two feet of fresh powder piling up on roads as well (02/18).

Residents across the border shared their experiences via social media and many expressed how unprepared they were for such an extreme weather event. "We've never seen anything like it before...but we must keep going," tweets Francois Martin, a resident of Pau in southwestern France (02/19).

Experts note that while global warming will continue to cause higher temperatures and sea level rise worldwide; Europe can still experience extreme winter weather conditions due to the continent's geographic diversity. "This cold snap demonstrates how diverse European climates are," explains Professor Emily Taylor of Oxford University (02/20). 

In response, local governments in both Italy and France have begun assessing potential infrastructure improvements as they recover from this extreme weather event that has left millions without power for days. "This experience is a wake-up call — we must be better prepared for future events," says Piedmont Region Governor Giorgia Meloni (02/21).

With forecasts predicting milder temperatures as the weekend progresses, relief from snowfall and blizzard conditions are expected across both countries. However, experts warn that more freezing weather is on its way next month with La Niña likely causing cold air masses to linger over Europe
