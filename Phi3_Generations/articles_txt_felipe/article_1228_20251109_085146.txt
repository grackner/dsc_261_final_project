A massive winter storm blanketed New York City yesterday with over two feet of snow as it forced emergency personnel into a high-stakes situation to keep roads and hospitals open for the safety of citizens amid freezing temperatures predicted throughout this weekend. Officials scrambled frantically, declaring an all hands on deck alert while local residents sought refuge in shelters due to power outages across neighborhoods from Queens to Brooklyn as wind gusting upwards of 60mph threatened downed trees and damaged infrastructure already seen during the relentless weather overnight. The National Weather Service issued warnings that sustained snowfall rates were expected at a peak pace, with forecasters predicting New Yorkers could experience one to two feet per hour in certain areas by mid-afternoon yesterday before tapering off later today as temperatures remained well below freezing throughout the city.


"We are urging people not only within our borough but around here and across all five of us, that they come get help if needed," said Emergency Services Commissioner Dan Nigro about NYPD's role in assisting stranded citizens during the storm emergency declaration issued at 5:00pm EST. "We will have to make some hard decisions because we simply don't have enough resources and manpower."


As of today, snowfall has been recorded by multiple weather stations across New York City with a maximum depth reported just shy of three feet near the city’s airport in Queens—a significant challenge for transportation. Power crews were working around-the-clock to restore electricity following widespread outages that left thousands without heating and affected over 50,000 customers across NYC as temperatures dipped well below freezing on Friday night into Saturday morning with wind chill readings threatening severe frostbite within minutes for exposed individuals.


"The snow is just unreal; I've never seen anything like it in my life," said a 68-year-old resident of the Bronx, who preferred to stay anonymous as she waited outside her house surrounded by stranded friends and neighbors hoping to hear from family members that they were safe. "It is very scary; we’re running out of food now."


Authorities struggled on Friday night in attempts to clear major highways before the early morning commute, but as temperatures plummeted below 20°F by midnight with wind chills approaching zero degrees Fahrenheit—the NYC Department of Transportation warned drivers not to attempt travel unless absolutely necessary. With an estimated two million residents without power across Queens and Brooklyn alone amidst ongoing storm conditions, Mayor Bill de Blasio implored citizens to stay indoors until it was safe for them or their loved ones to venture outside as the city braced itself well into next week before temperatures are predicted to rise above freezing early Sunday.

"There is no easy way around this—we’re going through an unprecedented event here in New York City, but I promise that we will get out of it together," said Mayor de Blasio during a press conference yesterday morning as he provided updates on emergency resources and coordinated efforts with other city agencies.


With snow depths continuing to accumulate across the five boroughs at an alarming rate, multiple incidents involving downed trees have prompted NYC’s Parks Department personnel working
