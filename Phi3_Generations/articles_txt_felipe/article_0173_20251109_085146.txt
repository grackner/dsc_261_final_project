A high-speed train derailment in Germany has left hundreds of passengers stranded and raised concerns over railway safety standards across Europe as investigators continue to look into what caused the incident near Frankfurt on Thursday evening (December 12).

Around 6:30 penermed, a high-speed train traveling from Munich struck an unmarked power line while rounding a curve at speeds upwards of 150 mph in dense fog. The resulting collision sent the lead engine barreling into trees off the tracks before coming to rest among shrubbery near Frankfurt, reports CNN Money.

The head engineer onboard said he saw flashes as if there were lightning just ahead about one mile away when things took a turn for the worse - and bystanders say it was impossible that no signals had been placed in time due to poor visibility from foggy conditions at dusk, reports DailyMail.com:

"I heard some noise like 'crash' or something," recalled Johann Schmidt of Frankfurt who happened to be nearby when he saw the accident unfold against a backdrop of orange-tinted trees and eerily quiet street lights reflecting off the dew on grass blades - just meters away from where two carriages came to rest.

As emergency services arrived, first responders struggled with freezing temperatures that persisted into November as they tended to injured passengers still aboard one of the train cars until firefighters were able to extract them in early hours on Friday (December 13). Meanwhile two more carriages continued off course for an unknown distance, authorities say.

"It's a horrific scene right now," said Uwe Meissner spokesman of Deutsche Bahn AG as he stood just meters away from where the train went down near Frankfurt Airport about 20km southeast of downtown Germany - with officials working on safely evacuating remaining passengers and retrieving belongings before beginning to assess damage done at least in one carriage, reports CNN:

"This is not something we anticipated," he said outside as crews worked frantically trying keep injured but unharmed aboard train while awaiting an official statement from Deutsche Bahn AG (the state-owned company that runs most of Germany's railways). At press time no fatalities have been confirmed, although dozsitters onboard with medical degrees began attending to passengers after initial shock wore off following the crash.

This latest derailment comes just months after Deutsche Bahn AG was forced last month by German transport ministry officials into making sweeping changes in its rail safety inspection procedures and has renewed fear over existing issues within their industry as it affects millions of commuters across Europe every day for work or leisure, with many expressing disbelief that this hasn't happened before.

"I feel scared," said passenger Maria Rossi who was waiting at Frankfurt Airport when she heard the loud bang and saw flashes coming from near runway just minutes later as smoke began to rise against an already dusk sky - a rare sight even for December mornings in Germany where cold fronts often arrive after sunset.

"I think something has fundamentally gone wrong with our system," added fellow commuter Antonio Belluci who says he regularly travels by rail daily across the country as it cuts down on traffic congestion and gives commuters an alternative to driving themselves - but this incident just outside Frankfurt Airport where a train struck un
