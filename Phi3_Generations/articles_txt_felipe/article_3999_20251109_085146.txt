A college football match in South Carolina on Saturday saw an unprecedented display of athleticism and teamwork as Clemson Tigers clinched a thrilling victory over the University of Georgia Bulldogs with just seconds remaining, thanks to a record-breaking field goal by sophthomore kicker Ethan Jones.

CLEMSON, SC – The roar in Exy Stadium was deafening as Saturday night’s college football game between Clemson Tigers and University of Georgia Bulldogs reached its climax with just seconds remaining on the clock after an intense contest that saw both teams display remarkable skills. Ethan Jones made history for his sophomore team, kicking a 54-yard field goal to secure the win at around 2:01 AM EDT last night as Clemson celebrated their fourth straight victory over Georgia Bulldogs and set new scoring records with an aggregate of 376 points in five meetings.

“It’s been hard for a long time, but finally we have something to celebrate,” said Coach James Smith on the sidelines after his team secured its seventh consecutive win over their crosstown rivals this season since joining Division I-A Football Association (FBS) in 2014. “I am proud of my boys and Ethan’s outstanding performance tonight makes it all worthwhile.”

Ethan Jones, who has scored an astonishing 37 points for Clemson during the season with just one touchdown but this week's field goal against Georgia will be etched into team history as a remarkable achievement. He made his college debut earlier this year and quickly established himself among some of top kickers in FBS while impressing scouts from major universities across America, who came to watch him perform during the regular season when he netted 37 points between touchdowns over two games played before Thanksgiving holiday.

According to Clemson's Director of Athletics Mike Johnson and senior kicker Tom Davis, Ethan is still adjusting from being a freshman who took time settling into collegiate level competition but credits his experience as the starting kickoff returner in high school with helping him adapt quickly at this new college environment where he made significant contributions during games before switching to becoming Clemson's primary kicker.

“Ethan’s success has given us a leg up against Georgia Bulldogs, especially when we needed it most last night,” said senior linebacker Marcus Young after the game on Saturday evening in which his team recorded 312 total yards of offense to help secure victory over Clemson Tigers. “It's been exciting watching him progress throughout this season while also giving us some valuable insights into what makes a successful kicker.”

Ethan Jones was born and raised on the South Carolina coast where he attended local public schools before joining college soccer teams at nearby colleges – first as an infielder for junior varsity baseball team followed by playing running back, quarterback or wide receiver in different football positions. He started kicking during his senior year when coach convinced him to try out after being impressed with Jones's natural talent and ability while serving on the high school track & field squad where he earned All-State honors as a javelin thrower prior entering college soccer programs alongside playing for various local club teams.
