Amidst a bustling film festival in Los Angeles this weekend where some of Hollywood's biggest names have gathered to celebrate cinematic achievements and new releases, an unexpected event has taken place that promises to be the highlight conversation for weeks to come. On Saturday evening at Alamo Drafthouse Cinema - known among cinephiles as a gem in the city’s entertainment landscape — audienselooked forward with anticipation until they discovered their movie tickets were not just stubs, but invitations to an exclusive screening of the critically acclaimed film "Shadows In Time," which is rumored to feature never-before-seen footage and a surprise guest appearance.

The rare event came about after The Los Angeles Times reported that director Ava DuVernay had decided to unveil some behind-the-scenes material from her award-winning film during the fest's closing night extravaganza on Saturday, February 18th.
