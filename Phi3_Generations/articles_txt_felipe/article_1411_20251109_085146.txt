In a recent turn of events that caught industry attention worldwide, celebrity makeup artist Jasmine Carter has just unveiled her newest beauty line called "Lumière," set to hit the market next month across major cities like New York and Los Angeles on October 15. The launch comes after years in development behind closed doors with a team of renowned artists, including acclaimed makeup specialists such as Ethan Turner from Harper's Bazaar Magazine and beauty influencers who have been testing the products extensively over the last six months.


According to Carter herself during an exclusive interview yesterday in Los Angeles, "The inspiration behind Lumière came out of my travel experiences across Asia where traditional methods met modern innovation." The makeup line focuses on ethereal looks that blend vibrant textures with classic techniques — all while emphasizing natural-looking radiance.


Ethan Turner commented, "Jasmine'in unique approach to beauty is a breath of fresh air in the saturated market," praising her ability to merge cultural influences into contemporary styles seamlessly. The new range boasts 20 skincare products and an array of foundations that cater to different skin types, including sensitive ones, with varying finishes from sheer matte tones perfect for red carpet events up to dewy luminous hues ideal for a day at the office.


The collection has been developed in partnership with sustainable beauty brands aiming for minimal environmental impact and cruelty-free practices, according to statements released by Carter's team on September 25. She expressed her commitment towards ethical sourcing of raw materials during an interview held at a press event attended by influential figures from the fashion industry who have already shown immense interest in becoming exclusive early adopters before it hits store shelves next month.


Carter's team plans to launch extensive social media campaigns ahead of and following her line debut, as well as hosting interactive pop-up workshops with professional styling advice from Jasmine Carter herself. The beauty world eagerly anticipates the full reveal in October when celebrity fans, makeup enthusiasts alike, hope to embrace a more vibrant yet naturalistic approach within their own style repertoire — all thanks to one innovative mind and her impeccable sense of design.
