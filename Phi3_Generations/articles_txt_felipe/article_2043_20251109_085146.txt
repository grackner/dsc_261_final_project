An unusual outbreak of a rare tropical disease has reached Panama City in just two months since its last occurrence here over a decade ago according to health officials on Wednesday. The Centers for Disease Control and Preneral (CDC) is closely monitoring the situation, fearing that more cases may soon be reported across Central America.


In Panama City's waterfront district of Casco Viejo, dozens have fallen ill with symptoms associated with chikungunya virus since August this year—a sudden and unwelcome return to a time when the disease was last seen in these waters during 2016. Chikungunya is typically transmitted by infected mosquitoes but can also spread through sexual contact, according to Dr. Mariana Rodriguez, an epidemiologist with Panama's Ministry of Health who confirmed cases have now been reported from several coastal regions in the country and neighboring Central American nations like Costa Rica and Belize.


"This is highly unusual," said Dr. Maria Gomez, a CDC representative stationed at their regional office here when asked about this resurgence of chikungunya that has plagued these tropical areas before but was thought to have been eradicated locally in 2016 after an extensive campaign against Aedes mosquitoes. "We are working closely with Panamanian health officials, employing surveillance techniques and intensified vector control measures."


Symptoms of chikungunya include fever and joint pain so severe that it can mimic rheumatoid arthritis in some patients requiring hospitalization. While there is no specific treatment for the disease itself, relief from symptoms comes with rest, hydration, acetaminophen or NSAIDs to relieve fever and aches as per health guidelines issued by international medical experts visiting Panama this weekend.


The last known occurrence of chikungunya in the area was back in 2016 when authorities launched a massive mosquito eradication campaign that eventually succeeded, with no new cases reported for years until now as tourism picked up again during past summers attracting thousands from around world to enjoy Panama's beaches.


"The return of this disease is concerning," said Ricardo Salas, a local business owner whose family-run resort on the Caribe Viejo has witnessed several guests suffering through their stay with chikungunya symptoms over recent weeks during peak tourist season. "We need to ensure our visitors' safety and understand that more cases might pop up as mosquitoes can transmit other diseases like dengue fever."


The Panamanian Ministry of Health is now encouraging travelers from affected areas or those planning a trip here within the next few months, especially during high-risk periods for chikungunya outbreaks in July to October when Aedes mosquitoes are most active. Official advice includes wearing protective clothing and repellent at dawn and dusk - peak feeding times of these biting insects that carry the virus between humans via infected female Asian Tiger Mosquitos (Aedes albopictus).


Dr. Mariana Rodriguez stated, "It's crucial to remember prevention measures can make all the difference and help stop this disease from spreading further." She added, however that officials are not predicting a nationwide epidemic as seen
