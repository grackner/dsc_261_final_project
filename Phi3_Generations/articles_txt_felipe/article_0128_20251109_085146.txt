A freight train carrying hazardous materials derailed near Sydney yesterday evening around 7:30 PM local time due to track defects caused by recent flooding from the Hawkesbury River in New South Wales, Australia (CNN). The incident occurred close to Campbells Cove and was quickly addressed by emergency services who arrived on scene shortly after. As of now, there have been no reported injuries or damage beyond a small release of chemicals into the environment which has already begun treatment protocols following local environmental agencies' guidelines (DailyMail).

Local residents were alarmed when they heard an unusual sound around 7:15 PM and saw flames in smoke rising from where tracks meet the railway bridge over Campbells Cove. A fire truck arrived quickly, followed by other emergency vehicles that rushed to contain any potential hazardous material spills or fires (CNN). Authorities have confirmed it was a train carrying crude oil and are conducting ongoing investigations into what caused the derailment which they fear might be linked to recent flooding in surrounding areas.

"We're taking every precaution necessary, with no one being endangered currently," said NSW Deputy Premier John Lee during a press conference at 8:00 PM local time (DailyMail). "Our first priority is safety and we are monitoring the situation closely." Firefighters were seen working tirelessly to dampen any hot spots that had developed on train tracks, as well as dealing with minor flames ignited by sparks from passing cars along nearby roads.

Local ecologist Dr Jane Martin has been called in to advise authorities about the environmental impact of chemical leakage into Hawkesbury River which is a primary source for drinking water supplies and recreation areas such as popular beaches around Sydney (CNN). "We're looking at potential short-term effects on aquatic life, but I think most residents will see no immediate change in quality," said Dr Martin.

As of now all trains have been halted between Campbells Cove and Brookside Station for a full night inspection while crews work around the clock to clean up any spills that occurred during this emergency situation (DailyMail). The NSW Department of Transport issued an urgent notice yesterday warning train drivers about track hazards after receiving numerous reports from locals who had observed unusual water pooling on tracks near Campbells Cove and Brookside Station.

"Our engineers found that the rainwater mixed with mud, creating extremely slippery conditions," said a Transport spokesperson during yesterday's press conference at Elystan Street in Sydney (CNN). A train driver who wishes to remain anonymous commented on how treacherous it was trying to navigate those tracks: "We had difficulty maintaining traction due to the wet and muddy terrain."

Official statements were released by Transport Minister Steven Marshall urging locals not to touch any affected areas or disturb wildlife because of potential harm they may face (DailyMail). Authorities have asked all residents near Campbells Cove and Brookside Station stay indoors until 9:00 AM local time today as cleanup crews work around the clock. The NSW government has not yet confirmed whether compensation will be offered to affected locals or businesses, but they assure their focus remains on safety concerns above all else (CNN).
