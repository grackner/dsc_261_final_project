In an unexpected celebratory twist this weekend in Hollywood, actress Emma Stone performed a heartfenering surprise flash mob dance at her latest movie premiere event which took place last night on the set of "Cinderella Wish" directed by renowned filmmaker Steven Spielberg. The charismatic star and leading ladies who joined her were moved to tears as they expressed their appreciation for Stone's dedication in front of a captivated audience, including fellow actors Robert Pattinson (The Notebook) and Brad Pitt (Once Upon a Time...).

In an exclusive interview with Emma on Sunday morning at Grauman's Hollywood Walk of Fame, the actress revealed how she conceived this surprise: "I wanted to celebrate my friends - all three of them who have been through so much together. We shared that moment in 'Cinderella Wish,' and I thought it was time we did something special for each other."

Emma's flash mob, which came about after months of planning behind the scenes with choreographer Lizzo Jones (Gnarls Greenberg), took place last night at 8 p.m., while fans were eagerly anticipating Stone’s solo performance in her film debut since "La La Land."

Actor Robert Pattinson, who is not a professional dancer but has learned basic steps for the role he portrays alongside Emma on-screen, said of his spontaneous dance: “I must admit I was pretty surprised when we all started moving to Lizzo’s beat. It felt like just yesterday that my last scene with her had wrapped and here were three stars dancing together – it's pure magic.”

“It brings tears to our eyes every time, but in a good way,” said Emma as she was joined by other cast members from the film for a post-premiere celebration at The Viper Room bar. “I want everyone here tonight - us actors and my family who are also present today – that we can look back on this not just with fond memories of 'Cinderella Wish' but as an incredible experience where friendship took center stage.”

Her director, Steven Spielberg was pleased to note: “I had no idea what I was in for when Emma approached me. But seeing these actors – all friends and professionals - together on the same dance floor truly made this event unforgettable."
