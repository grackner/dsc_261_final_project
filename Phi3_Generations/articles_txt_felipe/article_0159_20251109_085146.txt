In a daring escape attempt yesterday in Rio de Janeiro, eight individuals managed to flee from what would otherwise have been an internationally notorious criminal holding situation at dawn without immediate capture by law enforcement officials. The group comprised of local residents and tourists who were taken into custody after being identified near the Copacabana Beach late last night.

Craig Thompson, a witness to the events unfolded on 12th Street told CNN Newsroom that he saw "a crowd gathering around six individuals when police arrived" just before dawn began yesterday morning. He reported noticing one of them wearing handcuffs and seen struggling with law enforcement officers near his home at about five o'clock in the evening on March 10th, two days prior to their arrest attempt but was unharmed thanks to an off-duty policeman who intervened.

"These eight people had been held hostage by a criminal organization for over three months," said Officer John Harris of Rio's Metropolitan Police Department in his interview with CNN Newsroom yesterday morning, explaining the severity behind their attempt at escape. "Their lives were at risk constantly." Despite this heightened sense of danger, each person attempted to create an exit plan while they awaited law enforcement backup that had not arrived yet due to heavy rain and low visibility conditions affecting response times in other parts of the city as well.

"We understand their desperation," said Mayor Eduardo Pereira from across town yesterday afternoon during a press conference, where he announced an investigation into allegations surrounding this case with potential international implications involving drug trafficking routes known to run through Rio de Janeiro's favelas or slums. "But we must ensure that our efforts towards upholdin the safety and security of all citizens remain uncompromised."

As a direct result, authorities increased patrol forces in affected areas today as they try combating crime within these notoriously dangerous neighborhoods while also offering support for those involved in yesterday's attempted escape. "We will continue to do our best by working closely with international partners," stated Pereira during the same press conference where he emphasized that his administration remains committed towards resolving this issue as soon as possible and preventing future occurrences of similar crimes within Rio de Janeiro.
