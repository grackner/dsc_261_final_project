Two men were rescued from a flooded basement in Sydney on Friday night following heavy rains that led to widespdependent flash flooding across New South Wales state. As the waters rose rapidly at approximately 7 pm, locals and emergency responders alike rushed to help stranded residents in their homes as water levels surged beyond expectations within hours after a deluge began around midday.

In one particularly hard-hit neighborhood on Parramatta Road, Basement apartments became submerged under several feet of murky brown floodwater that had invaded the lower sections beneath Sydney’s outskirts before 8 pm when emergency services were dispatched to aid those in danger. As firefighters worked tirelessly for almost five hours, two men managed to escape from their sinking basement by climbing onto a bed and being hauled upstairs as rescuers waited outside the building with boats ready at hand during heavy rains that continue without sign of letting up anytime soon.

“We’ve seen water levels rise quickly, it was terrifying for all involved,” said Superintendent Chris Smith from NSW Fire and Rescue Services who oversaw operations on site since early evening hours when the storm first started to make headlines across Australia as some regions experienced record-breaking rainfall rates.

Emergency crews arrived within minutes of a distress call made at around 7 pm local time whereupon they found residents trapped inside their apartments, cut off from escape routes by the rapidly rising waters that had overwhelmed drainage systems unable to cope with such volume inflow rates. Residents reported hearing loud rushing noises and feeling walls begin giving way as water started seeping into electrical outlets before fully flooding rooms within minutes after an urgent evacuation request issued by authorities was ignored because of panic-induced hesitation among those who perceived the situation to be more dire than it actually proved upfront.

One witness, 35 year old Sarah Thompson, described how she helped a neighboring couple out before escaping herself shortly after hearing sirens from approaching rescue vehicles just as things got desperate inside when water levels peaked around three feet deep within hours: “I saw the kids wading towards us through waist-deep standing floodwaters outside their front door trying to call for help. Thankfully, they spotted our dog and followed him back into safety whereupon I joined them before we were picked up by fire trucks.”

Firefighters had previously struggled with limited resources amid an ongoing COVID-19 pandemic when deploying personnel across the state but managed to bring additional equipment specifically tailored for flood disaster relief in record time as a result of coordination between multiple departments. The NSW State Emergency Service and police also joined forces along coastal areas where waves crashed upon vulnerable properties due to storm surges while transporting stranded residents by helicopter before evacuations into overcrowded shelters began at 9 pm local time when water levels subsided enough for rescuers on foot.

“We’ve had some heartwarming stories of neighbors looking out for each other,” said NSW SES Chief Executive Officer, Peter Foster after spending the day overseeing operations alongside Police Commissioner Mick Fullam who was also present during his first major disaster relief mission since joining in 2016. “It
