On Saturday evening in a tight race for New York's governor, Candidate A narrowed their lead over rival candidate B by less than one percentage point ahead of an anticipated recount on Monday night. The election came down to the wire as both candidates galvanized supporters with passionate speeches across the state throughout the final days before Election Day in November 2024, leaving no room for error come voting time and making New York one of the most watched races nationwide.
