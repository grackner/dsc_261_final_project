In a series of devastating attacks across Mali's central provinces this weekend, at least four terrorist incidents have left over three dozen individuals dead and numerous others wounded as local communities continue to reel from the violence that erupted without warning on Saturday morning near Koutiala. This is only one of many such assaults within Africa where ISIS-linked groups are steadily claiming lives amid a broader insurgency in the region, according to UN sources and security officials.

Between 10:30 AM and early evening local time on Saturday alone (7 PM GMT), militants affiliated with al-Qaeda's Mali chapter targeted three separate villages – Diallo Toumaré in the Kayes region, Niama Bamanaeke within Seguedougou commune of Koutiala Region and Djebo Yerima Doumbia close to Sikasso City. The attacks are believed to be linked to a wider regional conflict involving multiple armed groups vying for control over territories in West Africa'in heartland, Mali itself having been plagsed with internal unrest since 2012 when the Tuareg Rebellion erupted as separatists sought independence from central government.

In Diallo Toumaré village near Kayes on Saturday (7 PM GMT), a group of gunmen ambushed villagers while they gathered for daily prayer sessions at their mosque before dawn hours under the cover of darkness; 12 were found deceased after emergency responders arrived, reports local police chief Oumar Konate. "It was sudden and horrific," he says sadly about how residents woke up to find bodies outside but no sign that intruders had entered homes despite their doors remaining locked until Sunday morning when one of the families finally found shell casings near an open window, a telltale evidence pointing towards ISIS-linked groups.

The assault in Niama Bamanaeke village within Seguedougou commune on Saturday (7 PM GMT) unfolded as insurgents burst into homes while residents were sleeping; witness and school principal Amadou Toure recalled seeing militants dragging victims out of their beds with gunshots echoing in the air. "The sounds were terrible, terrifying...I thought my life was over," he said as tears welled up before him after hearing about his father's fate while attending to school matters on Monday (Tuesday). Toure shared heartbreaking footage of a makeshift memorial for victims at their village mosque.

Further south, near Sikasso City in Koutiala Region during the late afternoon hours of Saturday local time as well before dawn broke Sunday morning when attackers opened fire on civilians walking through Bougouni market after leaving two families behind to tend livestock; 18 people lost their lives while three others were injured according to emergency services chief Oumar Diarra. "We are witnessing a terrible surge in attacks that appears unprecedented and shockingly indiscriminate," he adds, noting his fears about whether such violence will ever subside within Mali or anywhere else on the continent as terrorist groups exploit instability to expand their foothold.

UN special representative for West Africa Adama Traore emphasized that efforts must intensify in order address root causes of conflicts involving multiple actors seeking power and control over vast sw
