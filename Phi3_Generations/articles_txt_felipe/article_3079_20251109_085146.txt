A brawl broke out in a professional hockey game last night that left one player with injuries and others facing disciplinary action from league officials. The incident occurred at Riverside Arena during the third period of an Eastern Time match between local rivals, Boston Bruins and New York Islanders, on March 15th.

Bruins defenseman Mike Taylor reportedly threw a chair across the ice towards an opposing player from Brooklyn last night, causing frustration among fans who witnessed the chaotic scene unfold in front of them as well as leading to penalties for both parties involved and discussions about disciplinary measures by league representatives.

"I knew that he was a passionate fan like myself," said James Kelly, 48-year-in season Boston Bruins supporter at Riverside Arena on March 15th evening, recalling the incident after witnesses shared their memories with us today. "But throwing objects onto an ice rink is never acceptable."

A league representative told our reporters that they were aware of multiple security camera angles taken during and following Taylor's action toward his teammate on Brooklyn Islanders player Alex Rodriguez, confirming the fan had been ejected from the arena after being called over for questioning by officials. Rules dictate immediate removal when fans are disruptive or endanger players in this way, according to league sources that were cited today (March 16th).

Dozens of other Boston Bruins and New York Islanders supporters have since shared their thoughts on social media about the game's atmosphere which some described as hostile towards both visiting team members and neutral observers alike. The local police department has opened an investigation to determine whether Taylor, 34-year-old father of two who hails from New Jersey originally played hockey in high school before moving away for college studies at UMass Boston - a well known rivalry with nearby Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) students when it comes time around March Madness every spring season.

"The fight broke out on the ice and escalated quickly," said Alex Rodriguez's coach, who has worked in professional sports for over 20 years now based here at Riverside Arena told us after Taylor had been ejected from a game he was once proud to call his own. "I didn't see this coming when we started the third period with high-fives and laughter."

As of today, both teams have released statements condemning Mike Tailor's actions in connection with last night’s incident at Riverside Arena on March 15th alongside assurances they were taking steps to address their players for disciplinary measures. The league has been quick off the mark issuing a one-game suspension without pay, citing safety concerns and maintainance of respect within our professional sport's culture as its primary reasons today (March 16th).

“I think it’s important that we continue to hold ourselves accountable in situations like this. We must learn from mistakes made by players themselves or their fans,” said league spokesman John Harper speaking with us yesterday afternoon before Taylor's hearing at his office downtown near the headquarters of our organization today (March 16th).

A representative for Mike Tailor was not immediately available for comment but did provide an official statement earlier released by him following last night’s altercation between both sets of players and their fans that read, "
