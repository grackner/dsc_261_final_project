A local high school basketball team made history last night as they clinched a spot in state finals for the first time since their glory days of two decennial titles back in the late '80s and early '90s, drawing together fans old and new who are eager to relive that golden era. The 2023 Marshall High Warriors faced off against Montclair Prep last night at Riverside Arena on March 7th after both teams had finished first in their respective leagues with scores of victory led by the dynamic duo, Jake Thompson and Marcus Lee from the Marshall team who combined for a total of 80 points.

The excitement began to permeate through hometown streets when word spread that two former champions were back on court together after more than thirty years apart — albeit in different teams across state lines. Coach Thomas Bennett remarked, "It's not just the game or stats; it’s a moment for our town and everyone who lives here to feel proud again."

Marshall High Warriors have been working diligently all season on their offensive strategies as they aimed at reviving that once-dominant era. The team's point guard, senior Ethan Davis expressed his sentiments saying, "Winning is in our blood," while acknowledging the arduous journey and growth since those championship years ago.

As Marshall head coach Thomas Bennett led them to their first state final since 1993, an entire community found solace in basketball's ability to bring back fond memories of past glories through shared experiences on court night by night. With the Warriors playing with a fierce determination and skill reminiscent of previous decades’ top players like Thompson and Lee themselves once were — who now serve as mentors for younger generations at Marshall High— fans couldn't help but feel hopeful about their chances, despite being underdogs in this game.

"I remember the '93 state finals; we had so much fun playing against that team," commented a 52-year-old fan who attended last night’s match alongside his three children at Riverside Arena with Marshall High coach Bennett, reflecting on how sports can bridge generations and unite people in shared joy.

As the Warriors continue their run towards state final confrontation this weekend against Brookfield Academy—where they face a formidable opponent that has been dominating recent seasons — community members eagerly anticipate these historic clashes as if stepping back into time to revisit and celebrate past accomplishments while creating new memories.
