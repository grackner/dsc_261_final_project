China's GDP Continues to Surge Amidst Global Economic Uncertainty: Official Report Released Today in Beijing | World News - DailyMail

BEIJING (Reuters) — China’s economic growth continues on an upward trajectory, maintaining a solid performance despite global uncertaintries. The country's GDP expanded by 6% year-on-year as reported in today's official data from Beijing released at the annual National People's Congress (NPC).

Official Xiao Yang said: "While we acknowledge external pressures, our resilient economy is showing signs of robustness." The latest report comes amid fears over economic tensions between China and its largest trading partner - the United States. Last week’s imposition of 25% tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods was a setback for both nations, but analysts believe Beijing's steady growth could act as an anchor in these choppy waters.

The report shows China has outpaced most other economies worldwide during the first quarter with its GDP growing by 6%, while some Western countries are grappling to maintain positive economic momentum, including Germany and Japan which have seen their expansion fall below parity due largely in part to trade tensions.

Experts say Beijing's focus on innovation-driven growth has helped the world’s second largest economy achieve this feat; "China is investing heavily into technology, pushing forward with its Made in China 2025 initiative and focusing on sectors like high-tech manufacturing," says economist Professor Zhang Wei from Tsinghua University.

However, concerns are rising about the potential long term implications of Beijing's aggressive economic policies that have resulted in a rapid expansion despite fearsome environmental consequences; an expert at Greenpeace China commented: "This kind of growth cannot be sustainable on its current trajectory." 

Beijing has vowed to curb these effects with more stringent measures, including the recent ban on single-use plastics and increased investments in renewable energy. These efforts will continue into next year’s Congress when senior officials are set to propose a national strategy addressing economic development alongside environmental protection goals; experts say that balancing China's impressive growth with sustainability is the challenge moving forward, but Beijing has made significant strides already in this respect.
