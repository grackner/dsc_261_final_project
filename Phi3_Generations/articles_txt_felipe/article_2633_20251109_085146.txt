A celebrity makeup artist is set to release a groundbrein-making tutorial aimed at demystifying beauty routines for everyday people in New York City this summer.

The instructional video will be released on July 15, as planned by the experienced and well-known style icon Jenna Clarke, who has been part of Hollywood's elite circles since her debut role ten years ago but also spent significant time teaching others about beauty techniques in less glamorous environments like community workshops.

"Beauty is not just for models or celebrities; it’s an art form anyone can practice and learn," Clarke said while discussing the video project at a press conference last Thursday, held virtually due to ongoing travel restrictions related to international beauty expositions where she often participates.

Clarke's tutorial will cover key components of makeup application including base preparation, contouring techniques for enhancing facial features and mastering the art of blush that can be achieved with affordable products without compromising on quality or style. She is set to reveal her step-by-step guides along with insights into how different skin types require specific product choices in a format accessible via YouTube, an educational channel she's started just for this project: "Clarke Beauty Tips."

"When you walk out of my workshop or watch the video tutorial series I’ll be doing soon," said Clarke with confidence, "you should feel like royalty in your own skin. The power is back into people's hands — to transform their look and express themselves confidently through makeup." 

The celebrity stylist has received positive feedback from early viewers who have commented on social media about how refreshing it was to find relatable guidance for a broad audience, not just fashion-forward elites. Clarke's fans can be seen engaging with her content across various platforms where she often interacted and supported one another in their beauty journeys.

Jenna’s tutorial will become available on July 15 when clarkebeautytips is announced, providing an unprecedented opportunity for New Yorkers of all ages to learn about makeup while celebrating individuality within the city's diverse culture and society.
