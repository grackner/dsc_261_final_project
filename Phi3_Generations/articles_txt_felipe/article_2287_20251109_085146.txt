An innovative wellness program launching in downtner city's main hospital promises to enhance patient fitness by incorporating daily exercise routines and nutritional advice from qualified professionals. The 'Fit for Health Initiative,' set to commence next month, will be piloted at City Central Hospital before expanding across the entire healthcare system within two years.

City Center's Mayor Janet Thompson announced a comprehensive plan today aimed at reducing sedentary lifestyle-related illnesses among patients recovering from surgery or chronic conditions by encouraging regular exercise and providing personalized diet guidelines based on individual needs, medical history, and physical capabilities.

"The Fit for Health Initiative is a proactive approach to not only treating the symptoms but also empowering our patients in managing their health more effectively," said Thompson during her press conference at City Central Hospital this morning. The pilot program will include participation from 10% of eligible patient populations initially, with plans expand to reach all relevant groups eventually within a two-year period.
