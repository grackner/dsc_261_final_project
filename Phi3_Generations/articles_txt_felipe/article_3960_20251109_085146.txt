Topic: Business - Pre-markets

In a day filled with pre-market speculation and volatility spikes, global markets across Asia experienced mixed results as Wall Street wrapped up its trading session ahead of the opening bell in New York City this morning. As investors weigh their options between potential shifts toward domestic consumption amidst economic uncertaintty due to Brexit concerns, Asian bourses are set for a day where tech stocks and consumer goods sectors have been under significant pressure while commodities like oil see some uptick as tensions in the Middle East continue.

"Today's trading is reflective of investor apprehension due to recent political developments," says Michael Chen, a financial analyst at Global Market Research based out of Singapore and Asia Pacific region expert with over 20 years experience observing market trends in the area. "While it remains too early for definitive conclusions on last night's events leading into today’s trading session."

Early morning headlines suggested that Asian markets may have an upbeat start to their pre-market with Singapore, Hong Kong and Taipei all reporting slight gains while Japan sees its market dip below the psychological barrier of 20 points. However, these early indications quickly became overshadowed by broader concerns relating directly back to Wall Street’s performance as it struggled through what CNN Business calls a “tricky start” and reports losses between about -1% for tech-heavy S&P futures on Nasdaq's 500 index.

European markets in Europe are following suit with some countries, like Germany seeing its DAX drop sharply by around -2%, France experiencing a dip of nearly -3%. Experts from European banks shared their assessments: "The situation remains fluid and uncertain," states Pierre Dubois director at L’Oréal Paris. “We see signs that investors are moving towards more defensive sectors like utilities, pharmaceuticals."

Asian markets have not been spared from the ripple effects of Wall Street's struggle with experts speculating this could lead to a shift in focus as local companies seek stability within domestic economies. Accordingly, China’s Shanghai Composite saw an uptick by +0.5%, while Hong Kong Hang Seng index is off around -1.2%.

"The impact on Asian markets seems transient at this point; it'll take more developments to gauge the longer-term effects," says Dr Helen Zhou, economist with Asia Economic Institute based in Beijing who has over 30 years of experience researching economic patterns across multiple regions including China.

Within minutes after opening their gates and amid rising tensions from ongoing conflicts between Israel and Palestine that have been escalating since the beginning of this month, European markets continue to grapple with fears related back home while keeping an eye towards Wall Street’s performance as it struggles through its first day under a divided government following yesterday's surprise midterm election results.

Investors in London FTSE 100 and Paris CAC are both watching closely ahead of crucial decisions expected by the Bank Of England regarding interest rates, while across Germany investor attention remains on whether Angela Merkel will attempt a snap re-election to secure her chancellery role amidst growing political unrest.
