EAST LANSING, MI — University of Michigan Wolverines quarterback Zach Harrison threw a Hail Mary pass that turned into an incredible touchdown for the Spartan football team on Saturday night during their rivalry game against Ohio State Buckeyes in East Lansing. The improbable score took place at Doyne Central Stadium just before halftime, and it sent fans of both teams soaring with excitement as they erupted into cheers that echoed through the stands.


Harrison's arm had been clocking 80 miles per hour all game, a figure consistent since his arrival at Michigan last season when he quickly became one of college football’in most promising signal-callers in years. The Spartan Stadium crowd wasn't as familiar with Harrison yet and was captivated by this unexpected turnaround that left Ohio State fans bewildered after they had been ahead for the majority of the game.


"This play changed everything," said Jordan Harris, an Ohio State fan who witnessed the spectacle from behind his brother in attendance at Michigan Stadium with a ticket he borrowed during fall break traveling back to Columbus on Wednesday. "We thought we had them beat and suddenly here's this kid making crazy plays like that."

The 20-yard pass, caught by sophomore wide receiver Alex Smith in the end zone set Michigan up for a winning drive during their final quarter with just over six minutes remaining on the clock. The Buckeyes had been trailing since halftime and looked desperate to claw back into contention before making this ill-advised pass that gave way to one of the most memorable moments in college football history, said sports analyst Chris Greenfield who has studied game tape extensively after witnessing live broadcasts for over two decades.

"The quarterback's confidence is usually reflected by their risk taking on big plays," explained Greenfield as he watched highlight reels of the play repeatedly during a post-game interview Wednesday night. "Harrison threw it with his back to goal, but clearly Michigan had no intention of ceding possession and they made an incredible effort for that touchdown."

The unconventional pass led Michigan 14–0 in victories over the Buckeyes on Saturday evening at Doyne Central Stadium — a significant milestone as this is their first sweep since joining together to form rivalry during fall break. It also brings up memories of an even more surprising result just five years ago when Oregon State Cougars scored four touchdowns against undefeated Michigan Wolverines head coach Jim Harbaugh with the help from backup quarterback Kyle Allen after freshman Ty Odum was injured in a kickoff return. 

"That game is now legendary, but it’s nothing like today," said one Ohio State fan as he and his family packed up their stuff for what they expected to be an uneventful ride back home on Wednesday night's traffic-free roads after celebrations that included several hours of revelry during the game in East Lansing.

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh commented late into a post-game interview, "I don’t know if we saw this coming or not but it will definitely be one for history books." He added an optimistic outlook on Michigan's season ahead as they head to Indiana University next weekend with another opponent that had been struggling in their conference.
