In a shocking turn of events on Thursday afternoon in Sydney, protesters have taken to Waterloo Bridge for their first major demonstration against proposed industrial developments threatening the Great Barrier Reef. The march is set for tomorrow morning with thousands expected as environmental activists and concerned citizens unite over what they perceive a catastrophin' threat facing one of Australia’s most precious natural resources.

The protesters, who have been meeting in central areas since Wednesday night under the leadership of well-known eco-activist Sasha Thompson, aim to disrupt government plans for commercial fishing and tourism developments within reef territories set up last year by Prime Minister Scott Morrison's administration. The protesters demand increased protection measures from federal authorities at a time when global warming is causing the Great Barrier Reef’s delicate ecosystem to decline further each passing day, endangering its rich marine life and tourism-based economy that contributes nearly $5 billion annually to Australia's gross domestic product.

“The reef has been my passion since I was a little girl,” Thompson told reporters as they prepared for the demonstration outside Parliament House in Canberra, where federal government officials will be meeting on Thursday night regarding pending decisions about industrial development policies around Australia's eastern coastline. “If we don’t act now to halt these destructive projects that threaten our future generations from experiencing this natural wonder as I have, then it is all lost.”

Environmentalists fear commercial fishing and tourism activities are contributing factors in the degradation of the coral ecosystem within waters near Queensland’s Moreton Bay. The protesters plan to present petitions signed by thousands rally-goers containing scientific research from marine biologists who have been monitoring water conditions over the past five years, including Dr Simon Clarke's report published last week that highlighted rising ocean temperatures and acidification as a result of unchecked carbon emissions.

In an interview with Australia’s ABC News Network on Wednesday night ahead of Thursday's protest march in Sydney, Premier Gladys Berejiklian expressed regret over her government's shortcoms to safeguard the Great Barrier Reef from irreparable harm but did not dismiss plans for further developments that will bring job opportunities and economic benefits. “We cannot ignore these facts as we fight global warming,” she said, adding: "Our policies aimed at improving water quality standards are still under review.”

The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMA) confirmed Wednesday that it will attend Thursday’s rally and present its 2019-23 strategic plan for reef protection, which includes increased surveillance of industrial activities around the coastline. “We are here to listen,” said GBRMA spokesperson Alex White during a press conference yesterday where he criticized government policies as insufficient in preserving one's natural heritage and warned that without concrete action from federal representatives, Australia risks losing what it holds dear for generations to come.

With environmentalists urging protesters not only on the grounds of saving an irreplaceable part of nature but also their livelihood as tourism has always been a significant source income across all levels in local communities surrounding reef areas, this is more than just another day at work for many Australian citizens who want to stand up
