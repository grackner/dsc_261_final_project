Galactic Internet Set to Transmit via Space-Based Lasers by End of Decade

In a major leap for communication technology, plans are underway to establish an interplanetary internet using space-based laser transmitters positioned in Earth's orbit. By the end of this decade, scientists and engineers anticipate that light from these futuristic satell extraterrestrial beings will begin piercing through the atmospheric veil connecting distant worlds to humanity’s own internet infrastructure by as early 2035 – a move set to revolutionize how we share information across planets.

“We are at the cusp of an era where communication can span not just cities and continents, but solar systems,” said Dr. Hannah Zhou, chief technology officer for space communications company OrbitalLinks in Los Angeles. “It’s exhilarating to know that one day soon we might transmit a single tweet from Mars.”

The initiative called the Interplanetary Network (IPN) is being driven by government agencies, private corporations and academic institutions globally aiming at creating reliable communication channels beyond Earth's immediate orbit. Scientists believe this will not only facilitate faster information transfer but also enable real-time interaction between different colonies in our solar system such as Mars or Moon bases that could have been established by the 2040s, assuming continued progress on space exploration and settlement projects funded by NASA’s Artemis program.

In support of this ambitious vision are international partnerships like Europe's ESA-NASA JUICE mission targeting Jupiter system which includes Ganymede - a moon with potential habitability, or China National Space Administration (CNSA) planned Mars sample return expedition in 2030. A key aspect of the IPN is its robustness and ability to function amidst cosmic hazards like solar flares that could disrupt traditional radio waves used for space communication today.

Accordingly, engineers are working around clocks at companies such as AstroComms LLC based in Houston towards miniaturizing laser transmitters with adaptive optics systems capable of focusing light beams into Earth's atmosphere while mitigating atmospheric turbulence and weather conditions. “We aim for these units to function effectively within 20% cloud coverage, which translates roughly to about one in every five days on Mars,” said AstroComms Engineer Maria Gonzalez during a virtual press conference yesterday where details were shared regarding the project's technological specifications and timeline.

Additionally, research is being conducted towards developing optical fiber links stretching thousands of miles between lunar bases or Martian settlement sites themselves for seamless internal network connectivity once interplanetary channels are established with Earth via lasers in orbit at an altitude around 40,000 kilometers. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory has been working on advanced optical communication systems that could potentially be deployed by the next lunar Gateway module expected to launch into space sometime after its completion this year.

While still some years away from fruition due largely because of substantial financial investments needed for ground-to-orbit laser infrastructure and development, as well as in situ operations on Mars or Moon bases by 2035, experts assure that progress has been made over the last decade since initial conceptual studies proposed this
