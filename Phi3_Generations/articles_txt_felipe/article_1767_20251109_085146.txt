Los Angeles' historic KTLA Channel 9 just premiered a new weekend nighttime drama series titled "Echoes of Fame." The show follows aspiring actors and actresses as they navigate the cutthroat world of Hollywood while struggling with their personal lives. Premiering on Saturday, September 12 at exactly 8 p.m., it promises to be an entertainment staple for L.A.-area residents looking for something fresh amidst a sea of rehashed sitcoms and reality shows.

"Echoes is about the journey every artist goes through," says executive producer Jane Doe, who has worked with some of Hollywood's biggest names in recent years. "The show isn't just an escape; it’s also real."  

Set against Los Angeles backdrops that double for iconic locations throughout film history, the series promises a vibrant display of acting talent alongside heartfelt character development and storylines inspired by personal experiences within the entertainment industry. 

"The first episode drew in over three million viewers during its initial broadcast," reports CNN Entertainment correspondent Tom Smith after watching from his New York home office, who adds that KTLA has a devoted local audience known for their high-stakes television fandoms. "It's refreshing to see something with realistic dialogue and plotlines."

Celebrated director Chris Evans took on the first leading role in this debut season of Echoes, bringing his experience from both film directing gigs and a short documentary series about Hollywood actors he produced. "I wanted authenticity—a show that audiences could root for," says Chris as we catch up after one episode's wrap-up shoot day last Friday afternoon at Evans’ Los Feliz home studio, which doubles as his production office.

Casting director Laura Johnson reveals she sought out actors with diverse backgrounds and stories reflective of the industry they aspire to enter—hoping their onscreen chemistry would resonate across social media platforms where viewers discuss favorite characters live-tweet during commercials breaks throughout each episode's runtime. "We wanted people who had something genuine about them, not just actors," Laura says over coffee at the Sunset Tap House this Thursday morning with fellow casting head Maria Rodriguez and KTLA Channel 9 President Alex Brown Jr., all of whom played key roles in finding these unique characters to play on screen.

The show’s success thus far has already prompted a second season pickup, says network president Brown—alongside the three recurring guest stars returning for another go at their complex arcs throughout each episode's six-episode stretch of storytelling that follows closely behind Hollywood glamour and intrigue. "There is so much potential in Echoes," Alex tells us after a closed meeting with network executives this past Monday morning about the next steps to expanding such fresh content for KTLA viewers here in Los Angeles, which he knows have never stopped loving their local station despite its lean lineup of original programming.

Reaction on social media has been strong since Echoes' first episode hit screens nationwide last Saturday night—and will continue to be so as we anticipate next weekend’s air date for the second season, which features two new recurring actors alongside three returning guest stars: Season 2 officially picks up in October on KTLA Channel 9.
