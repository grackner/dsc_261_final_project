As Thanksgiving approaches this year, collegiate athletes across America are gearing up for an important season in college football—a staple of American culture that brings together communities and celebrates local talent nationwide. With the start date set on November 3rd by NCAA regulations, over thirty thousand fans eagerly anticipate homecoming games kick-off matches at universities throughout the country to commence what promises to be a thrilling season opener for Division I FBS teams alike.

This year’s events are especially significant given recent concerns about injuries and player safety that have dominated discussions around college sports over past seasons, including this one before it began – which ultimately led NCAA committees in the country to institute a series of new protocol measures aimed at protecting players. In an attempt to mitigate risks involved with physical play inherent within football games played by young men and women between 17-24 years old, these procedures mandate enhanced pre-season medical screenings for each athlete as well as continuous evaluations throughout their respective seasons on the field—which are currently being executed across various universities in preparation for this year's opening kickoff festivities.

“The importance of player health and safety cannot be overstated,” said Dr. William Harrell, a member of American Medical Association who has been advising college football organizations as an appointed NCAA Committee Member since 2015 — speaking at last week’ extraneous national-level meeting on the latest advancements being taken in regards to protective measures for collegiate players involved with contact sports. “By having regular and thorough examinations, along with following guidelines set forth by medical professionals specializing specifically in treating athletes—we have every reason to believe that all parties will come together not only safe but also better informed about how they can continue taking care of themselves.”

Echoing these sentiments were student-athletes who attended the meeting, including sophomore running back Jameson Simmons from University of Colorado Boulder—who expressed confidence in their team’s preparation efforts. “We are making sure that we prioritize our safety above all else,” he said as his fellow teammates and coach shared stories about last year's season during which one suffered a serious spinal injury while trying to make the winning touchdown attempt on kickoff return—an incident sparking nationwide debate over whether college football should be allowed at this level given potential for severe harm.

With all universities following protocol set forth by NCAA committees regarding screenings and precautions, teams are optimistic that they can minimize such risks while still maintaining a competitive edge within their respective conferences—and perhaps even make some history in the process as we approach game days this fall. Though concerns persist around safety issues like concussions or chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), which have been linked to former professional players of NFL-level talent, current college student-athletes and their supporters remain steadfast in continuing the tradition while ensuring these risks are mitigated as much as possible.

As fans begin filling stadiums across America once more this fall—and with games playing out over 120 days from now until the end of bowl season on January 5th, expectations remain high for a thrilling and successful run through college football's competitive ranks in spite of potential concerns.
