EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIP TO SHOW EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CRISIS IN SPORTING CULTURE THIS SUMMER – EXPERTS WARN IMPLICATIONS FAR-REACHING


AUGSBURG, Germany (CNN) -- With the European Championship kicking off this weekend in Germany and England's FA Cup final just last month under threat from extreme weather conditions due to climate change, soccer officials are feeling an increasing sense of urgency. Experts warn that unless significant action is taken now, future seasons will suffer greatly as they have already begun exhibiting signs during the most prominent tournaments in recent years.


"The reality we're seeing on field and court can no longer be ignored," says Dr. Emily Roberts, a climate scientist at Munich University who has been tracking weather patterns around major sporting events for over 15 years. "Sustainable practices need to become the norm in soccer culture."

Dr. Roberts' concerns were echoed at this year’s UEFA European Championship, which commenced on Saturday with the opening game between Switzerland and England witnessing heavy rain as players kicked off under a waterlogged pitch—a scenario becoming increasingly common in Europe where summers are warmer but also wetter due to climate change.


"We saw something similar last year's World Cup final, which is why we must act now," states Lars Müller, UEFA President and one of the leading figures calling for a greener approach within European soccer administration. "It’d be ironic if this beautiful game contributes to deteriorating our planet rather than bringing joy."


Müller has been working with local environmental groups since 2019 in an effort to reduce waste during tournaments and implement renewable energy sources at stadiums, starting next season. He insists on a shift towards sustainability before it’s too late for future generations of fans and players alike: "If we want our children to enjoy the same sports experiences that brought us joy as kids, they need this planet healthy," Müller says passionately.


But is soccer culture ready to embrace these changes? Not everyone believes so—particularly those who worry about costs and feasibility on a large scale such as club owners or smaller-scale players like amateur leagues with limited resources at their disposal: "We want the game to go on, but we can’t just throw money around for sustainability initiatives," states one anonymous stadium owner concerned over expenses.


Despite these concerns and mixed reactions within soccer circles, some clubs have already started adapting practices in line with ecological demands—installation of solar panels at the Allianz Arena home of Bayern Munich is among them: "It's a small step towards reducing our carbon footprint," says club president Hans Meier.


As this summer’s soccer events continue, it will be interesting to see if sports can adapt effectively before environmental impact reaches irreversible tipping points and alters not only the way we play but also experience these shared cultural moments on a global scale.
