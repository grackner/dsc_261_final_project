In a groundbreinventive effort to tackle world hunger, scientists at Cornell University announced on Friday that they have developed rice plants capable of producing an enzyme that allows them to grow in saltwater conditions — potentially doubling crop yields and providing stable food sources for coastal communities. Led by Professor Jane Smith from the university's Department of Plant Biology, a multidisciplinary team engineered this revolutionary biotechnological marvel which could change lives across vulnerable regions hit hardest by climate-induced saltwater intrusion into farmland and fresh water reserves.

"We have essentially turned rice plants into ocean dwellers," said Professor Smith, who oversaw the team's work that involved genetic editing techniques to insert a gene responsible for halotolerance — an organism’s ability to withstand saline environments— from seagrasses known as Posidonia Oceanica.

This breakthrough came after years of rigorous research and numerous failed experiments, according to the Cornell University press release which shared details about the project's history on March 15th — just before international experts converged at an emergency summit held in Tokyo where findings were discussed for global collaboration.

Dr. Hiroshi Tanaka of Japan’s National Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, who attended the conference as a representative from Japanese biotech firm GenTech Laboratories shared his insights on Smith's teamwork at Tokyo University during which he lauded their tenacity saying "It takes true scientific courage to venture into such unknown territories."

The next step is getting approval for the genetically modified rice from international food safety regulators, but Professor Jane Smith believes it will be an achievement that stands tall against other attempts in history. 

"Hopefully," she said during a recent interview with Global Science Review magazine "This feat of science can help secure sustenance for millions who face the brunt of climate change every day."
