London (CNN) -- Tennis legend Roger Federer announced his retirement from professional tennis this morning, citing persistent back injuries as the primary reason for ending what had been an exceptional and storied career. The Swiss virtuoso shared that while he plans to pursue other interests post-retirement such as writing and charity work, there is a bittersweet feeling over not being able to compete in Tokyo 2024 where Federer was set to represent his home country at the Olympics.

"As much as I've loved every moment of my career on court, this decision has been incredibly hard for me," said Roger Federer after a private meeting with officials and close associates yesterday evening in London during an emotional press conference. "My back injury is something that no amount of physical therapy can fully cure."

Federer's announcement came shortly before the start of Wimbledon, where he was slated to defend his men's singles title for a record-breaking 20th time this weekend. However, following discussions with medical professionals and loved ones over recent months as well as extensive trial runs at various tournament levels around Europe throughout January and February -- including the Madrid Open in March that he entered despite doctors advising against it due to fear of relapse-- Federer decided his health must come first after realizing consistent pain has not only hampered training but also threatened family life.

"He is a remarkable athlete who always gave 10% more than what was required, and for that reason alone he deserves all the love we have to give him," commented former world number one Andy Roddick while sharing memories of his friend during an emotional interview on CNN's morning talk show. "But now it is time to let Roger fully recover before returning back onto court."

Former Australian Open champion Maria Sharapova was also quick to offer condolences after learning about the news, recalling her own experience with injuries and career-ending decisions: "I know firsthand how difficult these situations can be," she said. "Roger has been an incredible role model throughout his illustrious journey as a professional tennis player -- it's no wonder he is loved by so many."

While the international community mourns Federer's decision to retire, there remains hope that other Olympic athletes who have suffered injuries will use this example for inspiration and learn how important health truly is. As World No. 7 seeded Canadian Billie Jean King told ESPN after hearing about Roger's news: "Health has always been my top priority throughout the years, whether it be training or competing at various tournaments around the world."

Federer will officially retire today during a press conference in London before participating against reigning Australian Open champion Dominic Thiem for his final match of Wimbledon. The game is expected to provide closure and celebrate one of tennis' brightest stars, while also allowing Federer the opportunity to say goodbye on home soil without travel limitations related to COVID-
