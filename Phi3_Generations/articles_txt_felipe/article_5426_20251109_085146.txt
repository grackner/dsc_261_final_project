In an unprecedented move to combat climate change and promote sustainable tourism, Greece announced yesterday a complete ban on single-use plastics across all major national parks starting next summer. The ambitious policy was confirmed by the country's Environment Ministry in Athens after years of successful pilot programs aimed at reducing waste within natural areas frequented by both locals and international visitors alike. Starting from June 1, not only will plastic bottles, bags, straws, or cutlery be prohibited but also items like food packaging that are commonly used in tourism settings such as cafes and restaurants within park premises.

Greek officials believe this measure could significantly reduce the impact of pollution on their famed Mediterranean coastline while encouraging a shift towards more eco-conscious behavior among visitors and locals alike, reported Kathimerini newspaper yesterday afternoon after several consultations with environmental experts nationwide; "As we continue to see the repercussions of climate change firsthand here in Greece every year, it's our duty as stewards for nature," said Environment Minister Theodoros Ziakas.

The national parks involved include Pelion Peninsula known widely among hikers and beach-goers alike; Parnassus Mountain revered by many mountain bikers and rock climbers, while Elafonisos island with its striking white sands has been a top destination for snorkelists in recent years. These parks draw millions of visitors each year contributing significantly to the national tourism revenue but also leaving behind waste that damages these pristine environments beyond repairing quickly enough through usual efforts - experts say this new ban could be one major step towards sustainable eco-tourism worldwide, reports Skai TV.

Local business owners on the island of Mykonos are expressing concerns about potential financial implications as single-use plastics have been a staple in their hospitality industry; however officials assure that they're providing alternative options such as biodegradable utensils and reusable containers, alongside educational initiatives to raise awareness among both staffers and customers alike. Environmental NGOs supporting this move believe the transition might not be seamless but are confident in Greece’s collective resilience for a greener future; "It won't happen overnight," says Maria Theologi, Director of Green Mesa Organization based out of Corfu Island and one advocate behind pushing through these policies nationwide. 

In the coming months leading up to June 1 when single-use plastics will no longer be allowed in Greek national parks visitors are encouraged not only rethink how they package their food while enjoying nature but also consider taking personal initiatives like carrying refillable water bottles and avoiding unnecessary waste production. The Environment Ministry plans to monitor the effectiveness of this ban through regular inspections and annual clean-up drives across parks with data being reported back annually for further reviews, a statement signed by ministry officials read yesterday on government website EuroNews last evening; "While we understand there will always be room for improvement when it comes to preserving our beautiful landscapes. This is just the first step towards more environmentally-friendly practices and regulations within Greek tourism industry," added Ziakas with hopeful words echoing in national parks across Greece as they prepare themselves not only against climate change but also welcoming a
