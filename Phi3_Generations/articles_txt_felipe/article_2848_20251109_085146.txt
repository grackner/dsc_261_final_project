An explosion ripped through a crowded market in Gaza City late Friday night, sending shockwaves throughout the Palestinian territories and raising concerns about regional stability as tensions persist between Israelis and Palestinians over land rights and political control. The blast occurred at around midnight local time (UTC+2) when unknown perpetratносиous activists targeted a popular food stall in al-Nawasi Square, the heart of Gaza's bustling commercial district.

Gaza City was plunged into darkness as power lines were severely damaged by flying debris; emergency services responded swiftly to tend to wounded and search for any missing persons amidst chaotic scenes near al-Nawasi Square, a place synonymous with vibrant street life. In the wake of this horrific act that claimed no immediate loss of life but caused multiple injuries requiring urgent medical attention at Al-Shifa Hospital, Palestinian officials condemned what they viewed as yet another attempt by extremist groups to undermine peace efforts in a region on edge with frequent sporadic violence.

Mohammed al-Sahag, Gaza's police chief stated: "We will not tolerate such acts of aggression that aim at derailing our progress towards reconciliation and stability." Residents shared harrowing tales about the trauma they endured during this terrifying ordeal; many described being knocked off their feet by massive shards raining down upon them from above in an apocalyptic display that left even experienced locals visibly distressed.

Authorities have launched a manhunt for those believed to be responsible while simultaneously tightening security measures throughout Gaza City and its environs; international organizations, including the UN, urged restraint on all sides amid fears such incidents could escalate into open confrontation between Palestinians loyal to Hamas ruling party—who maintain control over much of West Bank territory under blockade by Israel –and supporters backed by Fatah president Mahmoud Abbas seeking greater freedom within occupied lands.

While both sides have accused each other for inciting violence against civilians, Palestinian leaders emphasized that extremist ideologies should not dictate their people's pursuit of dignity and self-determination amidst years of hardship under Israeli occupation since 1967. Abbas insisted yesterday at a press conference in Ramallah: "We must stand together against threats from all directions that aim to divide us."

Gaza's economy, already weakened by the imposition of strict blockades and sanctions on its trade with Israel since 2007 amid repeated Palestinian uprisings or intifadas; has relied heavily upon humanitarian aid from countries worldwide for survival. Hamas warns that further disruptions in daily life caused by such violent attacks would inflict devastating consequences on already-strained resources, potentially exacerbating poverty and food shortages which plague much of Gaza's population living below the international poverty line even when aid flows freely during periods without conflict.

As investigations continue into this disturbing incident shaking lives uprooted by instability; Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas will meet with senior Israeli officials tomorrow morning to discuss efforts towards peace, security and mutual understanding in the region amidst hopes for a resolution that brings
