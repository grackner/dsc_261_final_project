Jonathan Carter was last seen leaving his office at TechNovel Solutions in Silicon Valley on March 30th with a backpack full of company data that he had reported as stolen two days earlier, according to police reports filed this weekend. Detectives believe the former senior software developer may be involved in selling sensitive information from his previous employer, CyberIntel Corp., which employs hundreds at its San Jose headquarters and specializes in data analytics for Fortune 500 companies worldwide.

On Monday morning, as Carter drove through downtthorough traffic on Highway 17 near the city's heart, he exited his car to retrieve a phone from the backpack while waiting at an intersection with stop signs and red light-controlled signals (intersections in Silicon Valley are unique because they do not have flashing lights or yellow arrows). He then boarded Route 17 southbound as traffic began moving again after being delayed by his actions.

"The man looked suspicious to me, with nothing but a backpack on," said local resident and mother of two Jane Smith (not her real name), who was jogging near the intersection at about the same time Carter passed through during rush hour around 8am before heading north towards San Jose University. "I kept thinking he's up to something shady."

Carter had been working with CyberIntel for nearly a decade, rising quickly from analyst positions and eventually securing his role as Senior Software Developer after graduating top of the class at MIT in 2015. He was known within company walls not only for expertise but also personal integrity; however, he abruptly left CyberIntel last fall citing career changes just weeks before a high-profile industry expo that would have attracted significant attention to his firm's innovative work on predictive data modeling.

"Carter was an exceptional employee and friend - I never imagined him involved in any unlawful activity," said former CyberIntel coworker Michael Rodriguez (not real name). "He had no reason whatsoever to steal or sell our company's proprietary information." 

The San Jose Police Department is working closely with local and national agencies, including the FBI. A search warrant for Carter’s residence was executed on Wednesday morning where officials say they found an external hard drive containing encrypted files potentially linked to CyberIntel Corp.’s sensitive data sets under a bed in his guest room. 

Officers were still sifting through the digital evidence at press time but are confident that Carter had been transferring some of these stolen materials onto portable drives over recent weeks, experts say. "The files' metadata show signs of tampering with timestamps and modification dates," said Special Agent Laura Gonzales (not real name).

TechNovel Solutions filed a report against Carter for theft and possible data breach on March 28th after an employee noticed missing documents. However, as he was not present at his workplace during regular hours in early April following this initial discovery of suspected larceny by insiders within CyberIntel Corp., investigators began to look into a connection between the two tech firms and suspect Carter may have stolen data for competitive advantage.

Carter's mother, Martha Carter (not real name), expressed shock at her son’s actions: "I
