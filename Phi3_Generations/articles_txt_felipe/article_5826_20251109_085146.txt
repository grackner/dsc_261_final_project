Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province – In a recent turn of events in Hangzhou, Chinese authorities have been investigating a series of cyber incidents that are now believed to be the work of North Korean hackers according to government intelligence officials (Xinhua). The breaches were discovered late last month and targeted multiple organizations within both public and private sectors across China.

The attacks, which experts say exploited weaknesses in commonly used software systems like WordPress and Adobe Reader, compromised data from more than 10 major companies – including tech giants Huawei and Tencent Holdings as well as state-owned enterprises such as China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and the Bank of Communications. Officials fear that these cyberattacks could potentially impact national security interests, disrupt critical infrastructure, or steal sensitive information related to technology development projects funded by foreign entities.

"The sophistication level suggests a state-sponsored operation rather than an independent hacker," said Wang Jinlu, the deputy head of China's National Intelligence Agency (China Daily). The CIA has also indicated that these incidents may be part of North Korea’s continuing attempts to gain access into global networks.

Since their discovery in late November 2023 by an internal cybersecurity team at Hangzhou-based technology firm Zhihu Group, multiple government agencies have been working closely with private sector partners and international allies to trace the origins of these attacks back as far as they can. While it is too early for definitive answers, authorities are confident that their efforts will lead them closer to uncovering North Korean involvement.

Hangzhou Mayor Yue Xiaoyong urged residents not to panic and assured everyone on Monday evening: "We have taken all necessary steps in coordination with our national security agencies as soon as we detected these attacks." He added, however; that citizens should be vigilant online when dealing with potential phishing attempts or suspicious emails.

Zhihu Group’s CEO Zhou Wei told reporters yesterday: "We have since updated all our systems and implemented more stringent security measures to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future." The company is currently offering free cybersecurity training for its staff across various departments while they work together on developing new methods of protection against these advanced persistent threats.

"No nation should have unchecked access into our critical infrastructure or confidential data," said Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhao Lijian in a statement yesterday, noting that his ministry has already taken steps to address the matter and urged for international cooperation through established global norms on responsible state behavior online. "We will continue working with partners globally as we pursue our shared interests."

Authorities have confirmed several arrests so far this week across various provinces of China including Zhejiang, Shandong, Jiangsu and Shanghai where individuals suspected to be linked to the North Korean regime were apprehended. These include engineers who used sophisticated methods like spear-phishing emails as part of their attack strategy (People's Daily). Official sources have not yet identified any specific targets within these incidents, but authorities are investigating whether sensitive research data on areas such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing might be at risk.
