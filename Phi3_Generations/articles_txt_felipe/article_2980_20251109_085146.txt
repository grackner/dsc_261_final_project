In a historic move on Friday night in New Delhi, more than three million citizens took to social media and public gatherings outside of their homes as part of an unprecedented mass digital detox initiative aimed at reducing screen time for health benefits across the nation. The campaign kicked off with celebrity endorsements that quickly sparked widespdis enthusiasm, urging individuals from all walks of life to spend a day engaging in traditional forms of entertainment and face-to-face interactions without the use of any digital devices starting at 6 p.m local time on Friday until midnight when participants would reconvene for reflection sessions before ending their detox journey after dinner with friends or family members sharing stories from their non-digital day experiences.

Sahil Sharma, an active participant who decided to join the initiative while vacationing in Jaipur said it felt like a "refreshing pause" and he noticed feeling more present during his outings without distractions of social media feeds popping up on every second screen. He stated that one can feel grateful for moments they spend with loved ones, appreciating the little things others might overlook while scrolling through their phone or watching television screens in public spaces - "It's about experiencing life as it happens around us."

Dr. Preeti Joshi , a leading psychologist and behavioral specialist at AIIMS New Delhi shared her thoughts on this initiative, stressing that reducing screen time has multiple benefits for one's mental well-being - "It allows people to develop stronger relationships with their family members while improving communication skills which may sometimes be lost when conversations are limited or mediated by technology."

As the nation embraced these new habits, many local businesses and organizations reported witnessing a significant surge in community spirit as citizens began attending live music performances at cultural centers across different cities. A report from Mumbai's historic Prince Albert Cinema where traditional Indian dance forms were displayed on large screens after dark found that the audience had doubled its attendance compared to weekdays, and this newfound communal bond is likely a result of people seeking out shared experiences without technological interference - "It feels like we are connecting with our roots once again," exclaimed Amit Kumar, who organized an impromptu dance session after watching the screening.

Experts agree that while it may seem daunting at first to cut off from digital devices for extended periods of time in today's world where technology is deeply embedded into daily life - "We cannot simply remove this fundamental part of modern existence," said tech psychologist Rhea Banerjee, adding however she found encouraging signs that people were making an effort towards maintaining a healthy balance between their digital and real-world lives.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi shared his views on the initiative while visiting Delhi as he commended this collective decision which shows how technology can sometimes isolate individuals instead of bringing them closer - "We must learn to appreciate each other without constant comparison or judgement," added PM Modi, before encouraging people nationwide that their participation will continue beyond midnight.

Looking ahead into next steps for citizens after the end-of-day reflection sessions are ongoing conversations about how best they can integrate these habits to make a more conscious and mindful use of technology going forward - "It's not just reducing screen time, but also improving face-to0 interaction," said Dr.
