In an unprecedented event that has astronomers and space enthusiastin around the globe abuzz, a comet passing close to Earth without causing any damage was sighted over California on Tuesday evening. The cosmic visitor, dubbed Comet Nutmeg after its unusually nutty-smelling tail as it passed by at approximately 12:05 PM PST (3:05 AM ET), has sparked a wave of interest in the scientific community and among astronomy clubs nationwide.


Dr. Evelyn Stark, an astrophysicist with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, expressed her delight over this rare encounter. "It's not every day that we have a comet come so close to Earth," she said. The cosmic iceball came within 0.3 astronomical units of the planet—just three times farther than the moon is from our world—but was nowhere near enough distance for any potential impact hazard."


Comets, which are essentially balls of rock and gas that travel around the sun on elliptical orbits often taking millions of years to complete one trip through space, provide crucial information about how water-bearing objects may have been distributed throughout our solar system. As such experts see every close encounter as an opportunity for discovery; they hope Comet Nutmeg's flyby allows them time to study its composition and trajectory more closely using telescopes on Earth, as well as the Hubble Space Telescope located in orbit around our planet.


California amateur astronomer Jim Cooper had his backyard setup ready for observation when Comet Nutmeg first came into view from Los Angeles that afternoon: "I've never seen anything like it," said Mr. Cooper, after examining the comet through a 12-inch Dobsonian telescope with binoculars on hand to see if he could spot any trace of greenhouse gases in its tail—a phenomenon often observed when comets interacted strongly with Earth's atmosphere during past flybys. "It was magnificent, I couldn't take my eyes off the sky for a minute."


The next day at NASA Headquarters in Washington D.C., officials gathered to discuss strategies on how best to capitalize on this rare cosmic event: Chief Scientist Dr. Susan Chao remarked that "there is no greater opportunity than now, with our advanced technologies and global network of telescopes."

As Comet Nutmeg makes its way back into the outer reaches of space towards Mars later next month, scientists will be diligently collecting data they hope to analyze in an effort to answer some longstanding questions about these elusive celestial objects. After all, it's rare events like this that make science go 'round – as one California schoolteacher put it simply: "This is a chance for us and the kids here at El Camino Elementary School in San Jose to be really excited about something real."
