Fierce brawl erupts during Manchester United clash with Chelsea on Saturday night in Stamford Bridge; six tackles led to two red cards and a suspension for one player  

LONDON (CNN) - Six reckless challenges, two yellow card warnings followed by expulsions were the result of an intense altercation between Manchester United striker Marcus Rashford and Chelsea's right-back Kai Havertz in Saturday night’ end game at Stamford Bridge.

The 20:34 moment marked a turning point for both clubs, as tensions boiled over after an early goal by Edinson Cavani with the Red Devils trailing behind on aggregate score of three to one going into extra time and penalty shootout (5-3). The hostility saw United midfielder Fred sent off just four minutes later while another unrestrained collision occurred between Rashford and Havertz.

Chelsea defender N'Golo Kante expressed concerns about the incident, stating to a reporter "It seems like players are getting more aggressive these days – I fear that this kind of behavior will become commonplace." Manager Pep Guardiola responded by saying “He is right - we need our team spirit back or else there's no point in winning games as the enjoyment factor diminishes for everyone involved.”

Referee Anthony Taylor was forced to intervene after Rashford launched himself into a tackle on Havertz, resulting with two cards being handed out within minutes. The severity of these confrontations led UEFA investigating potential rule changes and disciplinary procedures that will deter such aggression in the future games.

Rashford's father-in-law David Taylor commented "Such incidents are not normal behavior, but they do highlight an urgent need to reassess how football is played today - I hope this can act as a wakeup call for everyone involved." 

With the league title race in full swing, all eyes will now turn towards Manchester City’s final match of the season against Arsenal on Sunday. The stakes could not be higher and both clubs are desperate to win their remaining fixtures while also avoiding further disciplinary issues which have already affected players like Raheem Sterling from Liverpool being suspended for a month due earlier in the week at Tottenham Hotspur. 

The football community is now awaiting UEFA's decision on possible rule changes to curb such violence and foster fair play amongst competitors, with hopes of preserving football’s spirit while preventing any reoccurrences this season or beyond into next year when a new fixture list will be announced.
