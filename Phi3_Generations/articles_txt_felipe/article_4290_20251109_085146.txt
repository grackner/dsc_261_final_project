In a surprising turn of events this Thursday afternoon in Boston, left fielder Mike Anderson was injured during Tuesday night's game against his long-time rival team from Cambridge at Fenway Park. The news came as shock to both teams and their fans when the All Star amateur baseball league announced that he would be sidelined for two weeks with a suspected fractured ankle.

Boston Red Sox left fielder Mike Anderson was rushed on Tuesday night after being struck by line drive at Fenway Park, according to Boston Globe reporty John Smithson Jr., who witnessed the incident first-hand during game play from a spectator box. "It happened so fast," said Dr. Sarah Thompson, an orthopedic surgeon with experience in sports injuries attending him post-injury at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH).

The 27-year-old Anderson has been playing professionally since he was just a teenager and grew up idolizing the Red Sox legend, Derek Jeter. A seasoned player known for his impressive batting average of .350 last year with MGH as well as on numerous youth leagues across Massachusetts where he began honing his skills at an early age – Anderson's passion and commitment to baseball had been nothing short of admirable so far.

The injury occurred while the Red Sox were leading 4-2 against their opponents when line drive sent by a player from Cambridge hit him in left field, just as he was heading back towards home plate after catching an errant pop fly during his shift covering third base to shortstop. Anderson instantly crumpled on impact and screamed out loudly before being assisted off the field where MGH's EMT team quickly arrived for initial first aid while a Red Sox bench rep informed media that they will be taking him straight back to the hospital in critical condition, per his official Boston Globe bio.

Mike Anderson is expected to undergo surgery later tonight with an anticipated recovery time of two weeks before he can return on-field action for another attempt at playing professional baseball; however, this comes after a recent uptick in similar injuries amongst players across both amateur and major leagues alike. "We've seen too many young athletes go through something like this recently," commented sports injury expert Dr. Emily Green from Boston Sports Medicine Clinic while examining Anderson pre-op at MGH yesterday afternoon with her team, noting that the risk factors associated to playing baseball often include repetitive motions on hard surfaces such as dirt and concrete but also unpredictable variables like errant foul balls which have been increasingly more common this season due to larger stadiums.

As Anderson's family awaits word about how he did through the night during initial surgery, friends rally together at his housefront with plans of organizing charity games for local kids groups in hopes that helping youngsters learn and enjoy baseball will continue while keeping them off those very same hard surfaces used by professionals. The 12-year-old who caught Mike Anderson's foul ball back last year during one of his youth league visits says: "I hope he gets better soon, because we all miss him here on the field."
