In a recent move that has drawn global attention towards environmental policy and energy sustainability, China has announced plans to phase out coal power plants over the next decade. The ambitious plan was unveiled at an international climate summit last weekend in Beijing by Premier Li Keqiang, who expressed determination for his country's commitment towards combating global warming and meeting its greenhouse gas emissions targets ahead of time.

In a rare interview with the BBC World Service next month, Li emphasized that while China’ enduringly relies on coal as an energy source due to growing domestic demand amid rapid industrialization in recent years; it is now prioritizing environmental preservation and sustainability without compromising economic growth - which he assured would not be done.

"Coal will continue to play a major role for China, but we're on course toward peak emissions already," Li said during his speech at the summit hosted by Chinese President Xi Jinping last weekend in Beijing attended and applauded by over 150 countries. "We believe that everyone has an equal share of responsibility to tackle climate change, especially major developing economies like ours."

This announcement follows a decade-long consultation process undertaken since the country joined the Paris Agreement in 2016 - where experts projected China's coal consumption would drop by about one third from its current level. With around two billion metric tons of annual emissions, this phaseout could help significantly reduce carbon footprint and accelerate progress toward achieving net-zero goals globally as per United Nations guidelines to keep the temperature rise below 1.5 degrees Celsius - a threshold scientists believe is crucial in fighting climate change catastrophically impacting ecosystems, economies, societies worldwide today and increasingly with each passing year due to rising greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels such as coal powered electricity plants.

"This policy shift will have a profound global environmental influence," said energy expert Dr. Susan Liu at the Peking University's School of Earth Sciences, who studies China’ clean-energy transitions for Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF). "It not only helps us curb emissions but also sets an example worldwide to take bold action in facing this existential threat."

Experts believe that by adopting renewable energy sources and improving its electricity grid infrastructure, China will significantly reduce reliance on coal plants while still providing adequate power for economic development without compromising the environment or public health - as many regions are already experiencing in densely populated industrial areas.

However, some critics question whether this plan is realistic and achievable considering a significant portion of electricity production comes from these facilities which make up around 59% globally; along with concerns about energy security amid growing domestic demand for power to fuel their rapidly developing economy - an issue that's brought challenges in urban areas, where air pollution continues to be one the most pressing problems.

Reactions have been mixed so far across societies and sectors within China itself as well as internationally; environmentalists celebrated this major step towards carbon-free power generation which aligns with United Nations goals - while experts in energy transition remain cautious about its practicality amidst concerns over infrastructure challenges, financial implications for coal workers' retraining and potential impact on economic growth.
