"Boston residents grappling with a series of unexpected snowstorms began their weekend yesterday when an arctic blast swept through Massachusetts on Tuesday morning. Over the course of three days since last Saturday, Boston experienced record-breaking low temperatures and relentless winter weather that forced local schools to shut down temporarily out of concern for students' safety.


The harsh conditions struck when forecasters predicted a mild day with chances of rain turning into cold showers by late afternoon on Tuesday, prompting city officials to advise caution among the populace and prepare emergency services accordingly. Mayor Jane Smith stated in an early morning press conference that 'we've been fortunde enough this year not to be caught off guard again.'


The snow started as a light flurry around 6:00 AM but quickly escalated into heavy, wet flakes by midday. By Saturday afternoon, the accumulation reached an unprecedented three feet of whiteout conditions across various neighborhoods, most notably in South Boston and Charlestown where snowdrifts grew to impressive heights beyond city sight lines.


Dr. Henry Walton, a meteorologist at NECN (National Extreme Conditions Network), explained the sudden weather change was due to an unexpected collision of polar air masses moving southward toward New England—an event that is rare but not unheard of in this area's climate history: 'The merging of cold Arctic wind with warm frontal systems from Canada led to a rapid intensification, giving rise to these record-setting conditions.'


Despite the weather chaos, emergency services continued their work through Sunday. Snowplows were out in force day and night clearing roads while utility crews battled subzero temperatures to restore power during brief interruptions caused by falling tree branches on electrical lines throughout Friday evening into Saturday morning roundsup of this storm."
