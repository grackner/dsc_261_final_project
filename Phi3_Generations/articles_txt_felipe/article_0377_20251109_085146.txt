A major overhaul of hotel accommodations in downtner city is expected to revitalize tourism while prioritizing sustainability and guest experience according to local business leaders gathered for a conference at the Grandiose Hotel on Tuesday, July 14th. The comprehensive plan encompasses transforming outdated hotels into eco-friendly boutique accommodations by next year end as part of a city initiative launched in March aimed to promote green tourism and attract new visitors without compromising environmental values or guest comforts, reports ABC News from the summit.

"Hoteliers have been facing mounting pressure for some time now," says Emily Roberts, president at Greene Stay Hotel Association. "We want our city loved by people who value sustainability as much as we do." According to hotel industry experts present, investment in energy-efficient systems and locally sourced amenities will be key components of the revamped accommodations across 20 hotels within downtown limits—with most refurbishments projected between September 2023 and June 2024.

City officials have pledged $10 million in tax credits to spur renovations as an initial step, with a follow-up evaluation phase due by the end of this year for reviewing progress made so far on several projects already underway at iconic hotels like The Ritz and Majestic B&B.

The city's tourism department has also partnered up recently to establish educational tours focusing on green initiatives, inviting guests into newly eco-friendly properties where they can learn more about the sustainability efforts undertaken by local hospitality providers—a new trend seen as a promising way of raising environmental awareness among visitors while simultaneously boosting occupancy rates.

Hoteliers have been working around this agenda for months now and are expected to meet again next week at The Grandiose Hotel, where the city's tourism department will unveil details about an upcoming pilot project of 'Eco Stays', a new concept integrating locally-produced meals into guest dining options coupled with virtual reality experiences offering guests immersive journeys around historical landmarks within their vicinity—a cutting-edge approach aimed at merging educational content and enjoyment during stay.

"We are proud to be pioneering this innovative concept," says Mayor Thomas Greene, who has spearheaded sustainable tourism efforts in his city for over a decade now as he believes that the future of travel lies not just with providing comfort but also learning experiences which cater simultaneously towards preserving our environment."

Several guests attending hotel conference had praised these new initiatives thus far, citing an increase in overall satisfaction since hearing about progress being made toward eco-friendly accommodations and more informative stays. "It's comforting to know that I am staying at a place where environmental responsibility is not just talked about but put into action," says Samantha Lee who visited last month for her honeymoon, as she admires the revamped amenities available within their hotel while enjoying locally sourced delicacies on offer during dinner.

Ensuring that these progressive measures remain a staple of local hotels moving forward will be essential in continuing to attract visitors seeking unique lodging experiences without compromising ecological values, according to industry experts
