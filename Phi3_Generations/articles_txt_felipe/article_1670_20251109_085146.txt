A massive weather system that has brought record rainfall to parts of California over the past week is expected to unleash a second wave this weekend as it heads northeastward toward Nevada and Utah. Meteorologists predict at least six more inches will fall by Sunday afternoon, with some areas potentially receiving upwards of two feet in total before the storm finally dissipates on Monday evening after traveling an estimated 2,500 miles across North America over three weeks.

The unprecedented downpour has led to flooding and mudslides throughout much of California's central coastal region since January when this extraordinary winter began with record-breaking warmth; experts now warn that the state remains vulnerable as it faces a prolonged cool front expected by midweek. "The combination of heavy rain, strong winds from an atmospheric river could be disastrous," warns Dr. Emily Chen, chief meteorologist at Sacramento's National Weather Service office in Modesto (NWSM).

Heavy snow and powerful thunderstorms have already hit the northern half of California since Tuesday night when an intense low-pressure system developed off Baja. By midweek, it had stretched across much of Oregon into Washington state before heading northward toward Alaska's panhandle where a dangerous blizzard now appears imminent with up to five feet expected by the weekend in some spots along Interstate 90 near Anchorage and farther west at Lake Hood Snowcamp.

"We are closely monitoring these systems as they approach our region," said Greg Fay, Alaska's emergency management director during an interview on Friday afternoon (AZEM). "The storm is already making its presence felt with snow flurries in the area and we expect strong gusty winds from Saturday through Sunday evening that could bring blizzard conditions."

Fisherman Mike Anderson caught several inches of ice last week when he headed out to sea near Kodiak Island where temperatures plummeted into single digits (-18C/-2). Now with the storm in full force, waters are still frozen and fishermen have been forced ashore for their safety.

"It's a scary situation," Anderson tells of his experience this week while at home on Kodiak Island awaiting clear weather to return back out to sea. "We can see the waves crash over us but we know that beneath them lies much deeper and colder water so it just doesn't feel safe for anyone coming out there without support."

California, meanwhile, continues its struggle against flooding as rivers continue rising through towns in Solano County north of San Francisco Bay Area after a near-record rainfall on Thursday night (CA). Officials have warned that the heavy and sustained downpour could lead to disastrous mudslides. "The ground is saturated," said Mike Rodriguez, emergency services coordinator for Solano County Public Works department in Vallejo yesterday afternoon.

"It's been nonstop since January with some places receiving as much rain and snowfall combined over 40 inches this season alone." The rainfall caused the city of San Francisco to set a record last weekend when it received its wettest day on record during just five hours between midnight Friday through early Saturday morning (SF), according to meteorologist Dave Phillips with AccuWeather.com who observed as much at 19th
