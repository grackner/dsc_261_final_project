In a groundbre end for reality TV in America's heartland, ABC has announced that their popular agricultural competition series "Farm Fighters" will conclude tonight with its finale episode airing at 8pm Eastern Time on Sunday evening (local time). The show follows contestants as they attempt to transform struggling farms into successful and sustainable operations.

Lead investigator, Dr. Jennifer Scott from the University of Illinois says this may be a sad end for many viewers who have grown attached to their favorite reality TV characters over three seasons: "The impact that 'Farm Fighters' had on our community cannot be underestimated - it has brought vital attention and financial aid into rural areas struggling with farming challenges."

Actor, Michael Richardson (real name), who played one of the lead contestants in the series remarked during an interview: "It hasn't been easy for me or my family to leave behind something that touched so many lives," he shared. 

The finale had a record-breaking audience with over nine million viewers tuning into ABC last night, demonstrating just how popular this agricultural competition has become across America since it first premiered on the network in Fall of 2017 - making "Farm Fighters" one of its most successful reality shows. The finale also coincided with a nationwide protest by local farmers and sustainability activists, who feel that television too often promotes large corporate agriculture at the expense of smaller family-owned enterprises like theirs: "We hope this show continues to inspire people in other ways—showing them how they can make real changes on a small farm or even backyard garden," said protester, James Thompson.

ABC will air special programming tonight celebrating the legacy of “Farm Fighters” and honoring those contestants whose lives were positively impacted by their participation in each season: "This is an important opportunity to recognize all these incredible individuals who dedicated themselves wholeheartedly for a greater cause," said ABC's Head Producer, Emily Adams.

The network plans on airing reruns of the show as well as creating new reality programs focusing more holistically on sustainable farming practices and other social issues: "We want to build off this momentum from 'Farm Fighters', continuing our commitment in bringing entertaining, educational content with a conscience," said Chief Executive Officer for ABC Entertainment, Mark Johnson.

The finale of “Farm Fighters” has become an iconic moment on television and left many Americans reflecting upon the importance of agriculture as well as sustainability: "I never thought farming could be this engaging - it's brought me closer to nature," shared viewer, Sarah Brown. With its successful run concluding at ABC today, fans will bid farewell to their favorite reality TV characters with one last look into the world of agriculture for a long time in America.
