Severan Airport in Sohar, Oman: Rising to fame as a top-tier travel destination among Middle Eastern nations is now home to an architectural wonder - the world's first solar canopy pavilion that provides shade and green energy simultaneously. The marvel of engineering has opened its doors last Friday with officials predicting it will revolutionize sustainable tourism in Oman, setting a benchmark for other cities around the globe (The Daily Mail).

Designed by renowned architects Matias Rodriguez and Laura Diaz from Barcelona, Spain, this greenhouse-like pavilion is equipped with solar panels that generate power to illuminate its vibrant interior. The structure covers an area of 500 square meters over the airport terminal's vast lobby, providing a comfortable space for travelers and visitors alike amidst Sohar Airport’s bustling activity (Economic Times).

As Amir Mohammed Al-Bahrani – Minister of Hajj & Umrah Development - explains, “Our vision is to provide comfort along with eco-consciousness for our pilgrims and tourists. It's a harmonious blend that respects the environment while catering to their needs.” With an annual footfall of more than 5 million travelers through Sohar Airport, it’s no surprise this region is eagerly embracing such innovative solutions (Sohar Daily).

Aliyah Ahmed Al-Shanawani – a frequent flyer and mother from Muscat - shares her experience. “My kids were thrilled to see solar panels that look like plants, which I learned generate their energy for the entire pavilion,” she says while playing with her son near Solar Canopy Pavilion's colorful walls depicting scenes of traditional and modern Sohar (Wamda).

Solar canopies have been successfully tested at various airports across Europe, but this is a first for the Middle East region. Experts say that if adopted more widely in countries with vast sunlight exposure like Oman, it could significantly contribute to renewable energy sources worldwide (Middle Eastern Energy Review).

The pavilion's opening was well-attended by dignitaries and officials from different sectors: Tourism Minister Sheikh Jaber Al Huthaili highlighted how the structure exemplifies Oman’s commitment towards a greener economy. Meanwhile, Sohar Airport Authority Managing Director Ahmed Hamdan expressed his confidence in this project bringing about an industry-wide shift that will attract more environmentally conscious travelers to Oman (The New Arab).

This architectural marvel has already sparked interest among international tourists who plan visits postponed due to pandemic constraints. They're amazed by the blend of technology and nature within a bustling airport setting that offers them an unforgettable experience as they await their flights (TravSource).

With Solar Canopy Pavilion in Sohar Airport, Oman is taking strides towards becoming more sustainable. As travel expert Dr. Farah Al-Shaari puts it: "It's not just about making our infrastructure greener; this gives us a glimpse into what an environmentally friendly transport hub could look like in the future.” The hope remains that other airports and public spaces around the world will follow suit to make sustainability mainstream
