In a remarkable turn of events on Saturday night at Wembley Stadium in London, Manchester City suffered their first Premier League defeat since January 2019 when they lost 3-1 to Chelsea FC, with the match ending just past midnight local time on Sunday. The win propelled Chelsea back into third place within the league standings behind only Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur, while Manchester City remains in a distant fourth position following this unexpected loss.

Former Arsenal player David de Gea made his return to action as referee for this high-stakes fixture after recovering from an injury sustained during the Europa League match between Chelsea and Sevilla on March 23rd, only a week prior. The Premier League is no stranger to heartstopping finishes – with eight teams currently sharing top position - but few anticipated that City would find themselves unable to hold onto their formidable winning streak in front of the iconic Wembley crowd this season; de Gea's referee duties also led him back into play after a two-year absence from officiating.

Reflecting on his return, De Gea shared with reporthis weekend: "I always wanted to come back and work in the Premier League again." He continued adding that while he had been absent for some time working as an analyst during pre-season friendlies at Old Trafford - where former Chelsea defender John Terry also played – coming back meant returning home with renewed determination. "It's about getting my first game, staying focused on the referee job and just doing my best."

Witnesses described Manchester City as being uncharacteristically lethargic in their approach throughout this match - a stark contrast to previous performances where they had previously controlled games with ease. The home crowd seemed restless from start to finish, unable to contain the anticipation of seeing what other Premier League giants would do next time at Wembley Stadium on November 1st when all eyes will turn their way for Chelsea's return visit after eight years without a meeting in London since they last beat City.

The team conceded early with just minutes ticking off the clock, marking an eventful start to this season and raising questions about whether such setbacks might continue against other top-tier teams when these clubs eventually meet again at Wembley for league fixtures in 2021. Manchester City head coach Pep Guardiola said afterward that his team would be "evaluating everything" to prevent this defeat from becoming a pattern, while Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel remarked: 'We're glad with the win and proud of our players for staying focused on their end.'

As Manchester City contemplates potential adjustments following Saturday’s loss against Liverpool or Tottenham Hotspur during upcoming Premier League matches this weekend, it remains uncertain whether they can regain momentum heading into a hectic Christmas schedule.
