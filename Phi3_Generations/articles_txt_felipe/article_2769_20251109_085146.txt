In a historic move yesterday in New Delhi, Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated free Wi-Fi zones across major cities to bridge the digital divide and boost connectivity among citizens. As of today, over five million people can access high-speed internet within just minutes' walk from their homes or offices. The project is a part of India’s broader Digital India initiative aimed at increasing rural Internet penetration in a country where more than 60% live outside urban centers with subpar connectivity options.

Starting this January, the government started installing Wi-Fi routers across various metropolitan areas including Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, and Bengaluru to make internet access affordable for everyone regardless of income levels or location. “This is a landmark initiative that will empower millions of our citizens by providing them with unprecedented connectivity,” Prime Minister Modi said during the inauguration ceremony at India Gate in New Delhi on Monday morning, which was also attended by Union Information Technology Secretary Ravi Shankar Prasad and other senior officials.

According to a statement released after yesterday's event, the government has installed over 10,000 Wi-Fi routers across these cities with an estimated cost of $73 million paid through public funds allocated by local governments under their Digital India mandate. The project is expected to be completed in phases till March next year and further rolled out nationwide within five years as per the plan released last month, according to Union IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad who briefed reporters earlier this week on details of Free Wi-Fi initiative for rural areas.

“The connectivity revolution has begun here in India,” said an official from Microsoft Corp., one of several technology companies that have partnered with the Indian government to develop and maintain internet infrastructure, adding “Accessibility should never be a barrier because it holds every single person’s potential.” Free Wi-Fi is expected not only improve access for rural populations but also create new opportunities in education and entrepreneurship.

“As I walked out of my village home this morning to connect with the world, all thoughts about digital divide have faded away,” said a resident from Mumbai's Andheri neighborhood where she accessed high-speed internet for first time ever at one of these Wi-Fi zones near her house. “I can now learn new skills on my own and apply them in ways to create better life.”

Residents seem happy with the initiative, but some questions remain regarding how securely they would access sensitive information online without paying data charges as usual while others wonder whether this will become a tool for advertising that could increase costs of daily goods. Experts say these issues can be addressed in future iterations after initial roll-out by taking into account user feedback and evolving technology trends to keep the initiative relevant, affordable, and safe for all users over time as well keeping up with increasing demand which is projected at 30% per year due largely because of COVID-19.

“The biggest challenge will be scaling infrastructure that can handle exponential growth without compromising on quality or performance,” said a professor in IT from one of the country’s top universities who had been invited as an expert for yesterday's event, adding “We need to work with local communities closely so they understand how this free Wi-Fi service works and what is expected of them.” The government also plans on incorporating education programs targeted at
