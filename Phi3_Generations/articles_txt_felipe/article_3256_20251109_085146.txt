In a major shift in public health policies within Washington D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser announced on Thursday that free outdoor fitness classes will be implemented city-wide beginning June 1st to promote physical activity and wellness during the pandemic. The initiative, dubbed "FitTogether," is set for a six-month trial period with the potential extension based on its success rate as measured by participation levels and community feedback.

The mayor emphasized that these classes are not just about fitness but also mental health support in uncertain times when many D.C. residents have struggled to find consistent exercise routines amid lockdowns, "FitTogether" is an effort to bring the community together through physical activity while respecting social distancing guidelinesto reduce transmission rates of COVID-19 further within our city limits."

Experts from George Washington University School of Public Health and National Institutes for Health (NIH) have been consulted throughout the planning process, ensuring that all proposed activities are safe according to current knowledge on virus prevention. The fitness classes will offer different exercise types tailored specifically towards improving cardiovascular health without compromising safety protocols such as mandatory face mask wearing and maintaining social distancing where necessary in outdoor settings only, with a maximum capacity of 50 participants per class to abide by the six-foot rule.

In addition to these changes within city infrastructure , local gym owner Lisa Thompson expressed her support for Mayor Bowser's initiative saying it would be an excellent opportunity not just beneficial on physical levels, but also promoting mental wellness amongst citizens: "It is essential that we maintain regularity in our daily routines during this trying period so any effort made to get us moving and uplifted both physically & mentally will go a long way," she commented.

Moreover , DC Parks Department officials have confirmed plans for expanding the city's park facilities by installing outdoor fitness equipment where necessary, providing additional locations that people can access while maintaining safe distances from each other . The D.C. Council has also earmarked federal stimulus funds to help cover these expenses , signalling their commitment towards making this initiative possible and sustainable throughout its trial period of six months before reevaluation by city officials based on results gathered during the program's duration herein:

As one citizen named Michael Davis, who struggled with maintaining a regular workout routine prior to "FitTogether," commented; he hopes that this initiative will not only help himself but also others in his community find solace and encouragement through consistent exercise routines during these trying times. 

Moving forward , Mayor Bowser stated, “As we continue battling COVID-19 together as a city family I'm hopeful our efforts to stay connected while safely maintaining physical fitness will strengthen both individuals within D.C and across America."
