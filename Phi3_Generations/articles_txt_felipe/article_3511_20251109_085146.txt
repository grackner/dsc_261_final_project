On Saturday night at JiuJitsuFest in Rio de Janeiro, a surprising sight unfolded as five-year-nerds found themselves thrust into an impromptu acting audition on the world's stage — all thanks to their talent manager and reality TV aspirations. Amidst the laughter of children playing with martial arts props at JiuJitsuFest, a group of youngsters caught by chance in front of renowned casting agent Luiz Souza was spotted trying out for an upcoming ABC Family drama series titled "Martial Arts Mischief."

"We never expected them to get this far," said manager Carla Rodrigues. The team has been preparing back home, with the kids practicing their lines and martial arts routines as part of a showcasing video Luiz shared online earlier that week on social media platforms such as Instagram – now attracting thousands of viewers from across Brazil.

According to official ABC Family casting director Maria Silva, five-years-olds are not standard for auditions but with the current popularity in martial arts and action movies among children's shows, Luiz took an innovative approach by combining both interests as part of his unique selling point. 

"They bring a fresh energy that sets them apart from other actors on set," she added when asked about her experience working with the young group so far this weekend at JiuJitsuFest in Rio de Janeiro, where they would be attending an open call audition later today (Sunday).

The five-year-olds' parents watched from a distance as their little ones tried out various fight scenes and comedic improvisation routines with the help of seasoned actors. "It was so unexpected; seeing them in front of me felt surreal," said father Jose Gomes, whose daughter Lara landed her first significant role just three months ago but continues to pursue martial arts as well which she learned from a family friend who is an expert JiuJitsu fighter himself.

Luiz Souza has been making waves in the industry for years by consistently finding hidden talent among young kids, often incorporating physical activity into his auditions' methods to create engaging and dynamic performances on screen; this time around he managed not only to stand out but also break new ground with children as little more than two feet tall playing significant roles.

ABC Family representatives shared the news of casting these talented youngsters, saying it showcases their willingness for growth beyond just martial arts and into other realms like acting while still keeping up a healthy lifestyle balancing both worlds effectively without compromising any part as evidenced by Luiz's work method.

The network plans to announce the five-year-olds official roles in their show later this month, with casting director Maria Silva commenting that "It truly exemplifies why we need fresh and diverse talent on our shows today." She added: "This unique experience reminds us of how powerful a child's imagination can be; they bring an element rarely seen before which will surely add something new to the show while simultaneously inspiring others not as young or confident themselves towards their craft pursuits through these five talented kids.

As for what might come next? Luiz is already working on his upcoming project, a children's documentary called "Fighter Kids" about growing in life and sports that he hopes will encourage more little ones to find strength within themselves while expl
