A study released by an international consortium of climate scientists on Monday reported that global sea levels have risen at a rate not seen in modern times due to accelerated melting from both the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, marking potentially dire consequences for low-lying coastal regions. The analysis was based on satellite data collected over the past two decades (2001–2021) by NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Follow-On (GRACE-FO) mission alongside its predecessor GRACE, as well as additional measurements from radar altimeters flown on various satellites.

"We have observed an unprecedented acceleration of ice mass loss in both Greenland and Antarctica," said lead author Dr. Sarah Thomson, a glaciologist at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). "These observations highlight that our planet is warming faster than previously anticipated."

The researchers found that from 2003 to present day, Greenland has lost an average of over three trillion tons of ice per year. Antarctica's contribution increased significantly during the same timeframe—from about a quarter-trillion pounds in losses annually between 1992 and 2001 to almost half as much from 2013 onwards, which corresponds roughly with human activities ramping up after the Kyoto Protocol.

"Our findings suggest that these changes are not just limited geographically but also temporally," noted Professor Mark Brennan of Oxford University and co-author Dr. Thomson's work alongside international colleagues including those from France, Germany, India as well as Canada where most data collection was done via CNES/SPOTER satellite imagery acquired by scientists at McGill University Montreal Institute for Advanced Studies (MIAS).

In addition to quantifiable impact on sea level rise since 2003 alone — contributing upwards of one-tenth inch per year more than the global average based upon NASA's own estimates— this latest research provides further evidence that climate change is affecting our planet at alarming rates. Accordingly, governments around world must take action urgently or risk irreversible damage to infrastructure and potentially displacement of millions living along coastlines within coming decades if nothing changes about human activity patterns impacted by fossil fuels like coal mining in West Virginia State legislature debates last week.

"We are already seeing some areas being submerged due solely because their shorelines aren't keeping up with how fast seas continue rising," said Dr. James Hale, a coastal geomorphologist at the University of Florida studying similar effects along Florida Gulf Coast since 2016 who wasn't partook in this current research team but agrees on urgency: "We need to curb greenhouse gas emissions immediately or face catastrophic impacts upon human lives and livelihood."

Experts have warned that continued trends over the next several decades will result not only higher coastal flooding, storm surges but also more erosion as waves reach further inland because seas are already at least one foot above historic levels. The research team hopes their findings encourage nations worldwide to work together towards a unified approach that takes immediate action against climate change and reduces human impacts on ecosystem integrity globally rather than just focusing narrowly upon individual countries themselves
