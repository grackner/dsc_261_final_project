A recent survey conducted by Allianz among British business owners revealed that many are experiencing high levels of stress and work pressure as they push to keep their companies afloat during the economic downturn caused by COVID-19. According to Dr. Helen Baxter, a leading psychologist at Cambridge University's Department of Psychology involved in the study, "The findings indicate that over half (57%) of business owners feel stressed or anxious more days than not since lockdown measures have been implemented."

In London and across England, small to medium-sized enterprises are struggling with cash flow problems due to reduced customer spending. The survey indicates 40% of those asked expressed concern about their ability to continue operating over the next three months if current trends persist without intervention from governmental support programs or access to emergency funding options provided by private lenders.

"We are in uncharted territory for many," says Michael Thomas, a spokesman for Allianz Business Services Ltd., which helped facilitate this study alongside the University of Cambridge's Centre for Evidence and Impact. "Small business owners need to find ways not just financially but also mentally adapt to these uncertain times."

Businesses are implementing various strategies, from pivoting their operations online or offering new services that can survive amidst the downturn; some have reported a surge in demand for remote working and delivery solutions as people continue self-isolating at home. "We saw an increase of up to 30% more deliveries within two weeks after we expanded our capabilities," explains Sarah Thompson, owner of QuickDrop Delivery Service based out of Manchester with over ten years experience servicing the city's businesses and residents alike before COVID-19 struck.

Despite some sectors witnessing growth opportunities in demand for their products or services during this crisis—for example, delivery companies expanding due to increased need; experts warn that many other enterprises will not survive if they cannot tap into new markets quickly enough and adapt accordingly within the coming weeks. The Allianz Business Stress Index has since been released annually by Dr. Baxter's team every February, offering insight into business owners’ stress levels across a wide spectrum of industries in Britain during various economic cycles throughout history as part of ongoing research to understand how psychology affects commerce and vice versa better informed policy decisions can be made that consider both the human aspect alongside financial implications for those who make up our economy.

"Business owners must prioritize their mental health," Dr. Baxter advises while acknowledging, "It's essential they seek support from community networks or professional services to manage stress effectively during these challenging times." As business leaders navigate the after-hours struggle amidst financial uncertainties and workload pressures of a global pandemic; researchers continue studying its impact on British commerce for insights that may help inform better policies in future crises while providing guidance backed by science to manage stress levels effectively, both personally and professionally.
