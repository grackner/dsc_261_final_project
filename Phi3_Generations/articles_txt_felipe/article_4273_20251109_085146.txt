Melbourne Residents Wake Up to Severe Weather Alert Amidst Climate Concerns; Local Authorities Urge Preparedness as Storm Approaches Late Tonight

Melbourne – Melbourne residents have been urged to brace themselves for potential flooding tonight after a severe weather alert was issued by the Bureau of Meteorology. The storm is expected to hit Victoria' end first thing in morning hours tomorrow with wind speeds reaching up to 70 km/h and torrential rain that could lead to flash floods, particularly around low-lying areas such as Dandenong Creek.

The bureau has forecast more than two inches of rainfall within a span of just six hours beginning late tonight local time with the worst likely impact until Friday morning when some parts of Melbourne may be underwater due to rising water levels in rivers and creeks already saturated from earlier downpours. Victoria's Emergency Services Minister, Mark Calleja, says there is an urgent need for residents living near these flood-prone regions to evacuate immediately before the rain starts as emergency services are working on deploying resources throughout affected areas such as Dandenong and Yarra Valley starting tomorrow morning.

"This situation requires immediate action," Calleja said in a statement issued at 7 pm local time yesterday while touring flood-affected regions with his team, adding that all efforts are being made to help people who have been displaced or lost their homes due to the rising waters. "It is critical for everyone living along Dandenong Creek and its tributaries in Greater Melbourne to relocate safely before this system hits."

Calleja stressed evacuation must be done promptly as water levels will rise sharply throughout tonight's rain period, leading the state government yesterday last week declaring a climate emergency due to escalating concerns about worsening weather events in Australia. The declaration was an acknowledgment of scientists urging governments across Australia and beyond worldwide for stricter measures on reducing carbon emissions that lead to extreme climatic conditions like heatwaves, wildfires, storms and floods – phenomena often attributed as a by-product effect from the warming planet.

Melbourne's chief meteorologist John Foley confirmed last night at 9 pm local time on Twitter after reviewing forecasts that Melbourne may see its wettest June since records began in January of this year and breaking all previous monthly rainfall totals dating back to the early-20th century.

"As we speak, it has poured steadily for hours now with no end in sight," Foley told reporters standing at Victoria's Emergency Services Command Headquarters about 15 miles north of Melbourne along Yarra River and its tributaries that have seen flooding concerns before. "It is unprecedented – not since February or March, as per our records."

Campbell Rural Fire Brigade Chief Officer Michael Jones said his team was on standby for potential emergency rescue operations due to the severity of this latest storm threat after a year that saw devastating bushfires ravage parts of Victoria and other states. "We're ready, but we can only do so much," he commented while watching river water levels rise around him at Yarra Bend Park near Ch
