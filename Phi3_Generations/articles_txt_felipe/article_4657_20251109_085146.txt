A sudden drop in oil prices has sent shockwaves through global markets today as Saudi Arabia announced plans to cut production by an unprecedented two million barrels per day (mb/d), taking the total reduction for OPEC and its allies to a staggering four mb/d. The unexpected move came after talks among major oil-producing nations, which were expected to result in modest cutback proposals that would not impact prices significantly.

Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman stated at the OPEC+ meeting held last night that his country is willing to make more sacrifices for a balanced market: "If we all stand together as an alliance, our combined efforts will lead us towards stabilizing oil prices." However, he added with caution tones in mind about potential retaliatory measures by the U.S., which has increased its output recently.

The news sent global benchmark Brent crude futures plummeting below $60 per barrel - a price not seen since November of last year when OPEC+ initially agreed to record cuts in production amid fears over oversupply and falling demand due largely caused by the pandemic.

"I run an energy trading firm, so this news caught us off guard," said one executive who wished to remain anonymous. "A lot of our portfolio has been built up on expectations that OPEC+ would stick with their initial cuts." The sudden drop in oil prices is likely set back by more than a quarter before the end-of-March 2discount window deadline, when most countries are due to implement mandatory output reductions under an accord first agreed upon last year.

Experts say that such massive moves can have unexpected ripple effects in global markets beyond energy commodities alone; notably impacting currencies and financial sectors worldwide: "It's always risky when major producers change their policies," noted Amir Khan, a professor of economics at University College London.

Saudi Arabia has been under pressure from the U.S., as well as smaller oil-producing nations such as Iraq and Libya to ramp up production in an effort to keep prices stable ahead of next month's meeting when OPEC+ is set to review its initial pact on output cutback measures. The decision by Saudi Arabia today, the world’s largest crude exporter, came just hours after Iraq announced a 10% increase in production while Libya has promised an additional one million barrel per day of supply for export from April to September when sanctions are due to be eased.

In Riyadh where government officials and senior businessmen gathered today at the Jeddah Chamber of Commerce, there was much discussion about whether Saudi Arabia’s drastic move would pay off in terms of increasing their influence over oil markets while balancing out potential impact on revenues: "This is a risky gamble for our country," said Khalid bin Abdulmohsin Alkharbousi, chairman of the chamber's board.

Saudi Arabia and other major OPEC+ producers are due to meet next week in Vienna where ministerial delegations representing around 20 nations will gather for their annual review meeting - a vital time when member states can discuss policy changes or adjustments if needed, according to Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman.
