In a recent development within British politics, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his cabinet members have been accused of misconstrue diplomatic protocol during international summits this month. The controversy has emerged amid efforts to strengthen transatlantic relations as Europe faces multiple challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic on one end and rising populism in many countries, including Britain's own internal political tensions at another.

In an interview with a BBC reporter last Thursday afternoon, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab denied that any breaches of protocol had occurred during his participation in the latest NATO summit held in London from 14-20 February. "I am confident we followed proper etiquette and respected all delegates," he insisted before continuing to discuss matters related to defense cooperation between Europe and North America, as per official reports released by The Times last weekend.

However, this stance was met with skepticism from diplomats attending the same summit who shared their experiences on social media platforms: "I witnessed Johnson speaking directly at Queen Elizabeth II's head without seeking permission or an introduction," wrote one envoy in a tweet posted later that evening. Several others corroborated these claims and even provided footage which they claimed showed other instances where senior officials also appeared to have bypassed protocol during meetings with foreign dignitaries across various summits held around the world last month, as per Guardian reports citing multiple attendees' accounts on social media.

An investigation has been launched into these allegations and a spokesperson for Downing Street confirmed that officials would cooperate fully while scrutinizing video footage obtained from independent sources such as those shared by the diplomats mentioned above: "We are committed to upholding all standards expected of our representatives abroad, including respect towards their counterparts. We understand your concerns and will ensure a thorough investigation into these claims is carried out," said James Dunn, Spokesperson for Boris Johnson's office in an official statement released yesterday evening after the government came under mounting pressure to address criticism from some within Britain itself as well abroad.

Johnson has not yet commented directly on this latest development while still busy dealing with domestic matters back home and upcoming elections, but sources close to him say that he remains focused primarily on Brexit negotiations which are set to conclude shortly after polls open later today in England: "Despite these unrelated allegations being circulated online by some people who may want our government's attention for their own purposes - and understandably causing unease within certain circles here – we believe that the PM will maintain his concentration on finalizing Brexit arrangements, as he has stated previously. This matter is of utmost importance to him personally," said one senior aide close to Johnson who requested anonymity due to sensitivity around this issue but spoke freely about what they believed would transpire next given the current situation: "Our PM does not easily lose his cool, as many here know well. When he believes something is against our nation's best interests - and I believe strongly that protecting our diplomatic standing abroad remains a top priority for him at this time – we expect no less than decisive action in resolving these allegations once investigations conclude."

CNN understands further details of the investigation are yet to be made public, but observers suggest Johnson could face pressure from both within his own party and
