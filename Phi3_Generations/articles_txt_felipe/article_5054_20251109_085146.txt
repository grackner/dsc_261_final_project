During a tense atmosphere at Dodger Stadium last night as fans eagerly awaited their team's chance to turn things around in an intense NLDS game against the Braves; something extraordinary happened that left even players on both sides visibly shaken and shook up professional baseball. In what can only be described as a bizarre incident, at approximately 7:45 PM local time (EDT), just before the start of Game 3 in Los Angeles, an unexpected weather phenomenon took center stage - heavy rain showers combined with hailstones to create conditions that made playing baseball underway impossible.

Earlier today as anticipation reached a fever pitch for what many hoped would be the first win since their disastrous home series last month; both Los Angeles Dodgers and Atlanta Braves fans prepared themselves not just emotionally, but mentally to witness this showdown on Sunday night under L.A.'in sky's cloudy veil - unaware that Mother Nature had other plans in store for the city of angels with baseball as its heartbeat; they faced a spectacle where nature dictated play instead.

Beside fielding equipment and game-day necessities such as bats were players' protective gear - helmets designed to shield against typical injuries on the diamond; these items now provided little more than temporary refuge from the torrential downpour which played spoiler in this highly anticipated postseason matchup.

As both teams huddled under their respective shelter tents, a grim understanding spread among them - that even with pitchers warming up and catcher’s mound ready for action; playing baseball as if Mother Nature wasn't having her way would not come to fruition anytime soon.

"This is going to be the only thing on our minds tonight until we can get back out there," said veteran pitcher Tom Anderson in between drying off his glove and shoulder pad with a handkerchief, which he was now sporting as an accessory over regular attire due to continuous dripping water; "our focus has been solely on winning this series but the
