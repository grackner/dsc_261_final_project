NEW YORK — The latest stock market data indicates a potential economic slowdown as late October approaches, leaving many businesses across the Big Apple braced for impact on their bottom lines and operations amidst dwindling after-hours trading activity. While Wall Street analysts monitor S&P 500 companies' performance in what is traditionally one of its most lucrthy months before year-end, economic experts are growing increasingly cautious about the potential ramifications for both local and national businesses alike if current trends continue.

"In recent years, October has been a strong month due to companies' end-of-quarter earnings reports," said Mark Johnson, Senior Financial Analyst at Goldman Sachs in New York City on Friday afternoon (October 23rd). "But this year seems different."

Experts agree that the economic climate of recent months — marked by trade disputes and concerns about interest rate hikes - have led to some investors adopting a more defensive stance, causing less enthusiasm for riskier stocks like technology firms. As such, after-hours trading performance has been weaker than in the same period last year, according to data released by S&P Dow Jones Indices on October 23rd.

"The market's overall sentiment seems subdued," said Lisa Thompson, a financial advisor at JPMorgan Asset Management and senior analyst for Wall Street trends based in Midtown Manhattan. "Companies that traditionally see an increase in after-hours trade due to their end of quarter results aren't as buoyant this year."

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio recently expressed his concern about the state of local businesses struggling amidst economic uncertainty, emphasizing on Wednesday (October 21st) that city resources would continue being allocated to ensure stability for New Yorkers. "We've seen some changes in after-hours trading activity lately which could impact small and medium sized enterprises across the five boroughs," de Blasio said during a press conference at City Hall on Tuesday (October 20th).

Indeed, according to data from Eikon by Refinitiv released earlier this week, S&P 500 companies that report earnings after hours saw $38.7 billion in trading volume — down approximately 19 percent when compared with the same period last year (October 26-November 2). Additionally, sector breakdowns reveal technology firms are seeing more sluggish performance during this key month for investors: Companies including Apple Inc., Microsoft Corporation and IBM accounted for approximately $15.3 billion of after hours trading activity in October — a decline from the same period last year when they amassed nearly double that amount, or roughly $28.6 billion (in USD).

Economists believe investors' more conservative behavior is linked to several factors including mounting trade concerns and uncertainties over Federal Reserve interest rate hikes: "Investor
