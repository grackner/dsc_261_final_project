In a groundbredependent move on television ratings and streaming figures, popular American sitcom "Friends" is getting revived for its fifth season next year at HBO Max Originals with the participation of original cast members Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry, David Schwimmer, and Candice Bergen. The news broke yesterday in New York City when representatives from 20th Century Fox Television unveiled plans to bring back the iconic show which first premiered on NBC's flagship network in Los Angeles during fall of '94 after wrapping production last summer at CBS Studios Burbank, California.

"We are delighted that our beloved classic will soon grace screens once again," a Fox Television representative told reporters yesterday afternoon as cast members stood proudly by his side on-set which was bustling with hired extras and crew working towards making this project come to fruition. 

Fans have been ecstatic about the announcement of "Friends" return, flooding social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook since news broke earlier yesterday afternoon through well-known gossip blogs such as Hollywood Life & Me Magazine among others citing rumors by insiders for months before official confirmation was made public last night.

This latest installment of the popular comedy series is expected to be 20 episodes long, divided into two seasons airing back-to-back between April and December next year exclusively on HBO Max Originals - an expansion from its previous home at Netflix since late 2018 before being renewed for a fifth season just this past March following the success of newest installment release.

A source close to Jennifer Aniston spoke yesterday with her representatives who confirmed that production will begin in Los Angeles starting next summer and wrapping up by fall, saying: "We're all excited about coming together again as a group for what promises to be another fantastic journey around motherhood on this revival of our classic sitcom."

As more details emerge regarding the plot which involves Monica returning home after 15 years abroad only finding out her ex-husband and children have moved on with their own lives while she tries reconnecting, fans are eagerly anticipating seeing how friends come together in this new era of adulthood. Experts say it's a great example for viewers to see women navigate postpartum life beyond the office alongside raising small kids and managing relationships which can be hard work but ultimately so rewarding that nobody wants anything less than excellence when they watch these characters try their best amidst all adversities thrown at them.

For those unable or not interested in watching, streaming options like Disney+ are set to release episodes of "Friends" on DVD simultaneously with the original air dates and HBO Max Originals next year as part efforts for maintaining fan connection regardless if they're physically available during broadcasts but still want access. The news has prompted fans worldwide into discussions about their favorite episode memories, jokes or quotes while also providing valuable insights on societal progress in the portrayal of strong female leads with career-minded mothers who are not just defined by having children but fully integrated as capable professionals within society itself.

With such a positive reaction from fans across generations and countries alike, many speculate that this could be indicative towards new shows featuring similar themes aiming to tackle modern issues like childcare without sacrificing humor or character
