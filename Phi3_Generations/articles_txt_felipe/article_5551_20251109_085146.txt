A powerful winter storm sweeping across Colorado was downgraded to a squall line with potential flash flood risks as it moved eastward toward Kansas on Friday evening, according to the National Weather Service (NWS) in Denver. The original forecast for heavy snow predicted that up to eight feet could have accumulated by late Sunday night if conditions hadn't changed drastically since last Tuesday afternoon when first warnings were issued from Colorado Springs NBC affiliate KOCT-TV, marking one of the earliest winter storm alerts in the region.

As authorities continued monitoring and preparations for potential flooding along rivers that could overflow their banks due to rapid snowmelt caused by warm temperatures following a record heatwave this summer, several major dams experienced an increase in pressure levels since midnight yesterday throughout Colorado with about 15 reservoirs at or above capacity.

Kenneth Johnson, senior meteorologist for the NWS stationed at Denver International Airport told Fox News he was closely observing rainfall rates near Cripple Creek as more warm frontal systems entered into Kansas overnight – a concern among locals who recall similar flooding during previous storms in 2013 and again last year.

"I wouldn't be surprised if we see several rivers rise by at least two to three feet within the next few hours," Johnson said, warning that while flash flood warnings have been issued for parts of Pueblo County as well on Thursday evening ahead of high winds and heavy precipitation overnight.
"It's not just about snow but also rain falling from dark clouds above a very warm surface." 

As water levels continue to rise throughout the region, emergency response teams have been mobilized with several evacuations taking place in areas at risk along rivers like South Platte near Denver International Airport and Arkansas River Valley north of Pueblo. With additional reservoirs expected to reach full capacity tomorrow evening due to continued rainfall forecasts into Saturday, the NWS has issued a winter storm warning across most parts of Kansas with potential flash flood risks still in place through at least mid-Saturday night before settling back down below normal temperatures overnight. 

"We are closely monitoring conditions here; our priority is to protect life and property from these rapidly changing weather patterns," said Chief Deputy Sheriff Greg Johnson of Prowers County, which includes sections near where the storm's center moved into Kansas earlier today. As a result of continued flooding risks expected this weekend for areas along Platte River Basin including Hays City in Norton County and nearby Rock Springs that saw record rainfall during July heatwave last summer while being braced against potential ice jams as temperatures dip below freezing tonight, residents are advised to stay indoors until further notice. 

With numerous motorists stranded across sections of Kansas Highway E35 in between these two locations after heavy rains started pouring into the area late Thursday afternoon and early Friday morning following warnings issued last night by local officials along with reports from highway patrol departments, authorities asked citizens to seek safe transportation elsewhere if possible. 

As temperatures are expected drop below freezing tonight causing potential ice jams on already swollen rivers in the region leading into Saturday and Sunday before cooling down somewhat tomorrow evening as rain subsides but lingering showers continue through much of Kansas, state agencies have issued advisories asking citizens to
