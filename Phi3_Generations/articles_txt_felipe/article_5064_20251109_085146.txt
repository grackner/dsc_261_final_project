As a tropical storm system churned through Central America on Tuesday afternoon, officials issued warnings and residents in vulnerable areas sought shelter from potential flooding as heavy rains continued unabated since last night's landfall. The Category 1 hurricane struck the eastern coastline of Nicaragua with maximum sustained winds estimated at around 74 miles per hour (mph), according to local meteorological data, and quickly spread inland across Honduras before weakening into a tropical storm as it progressed toward El Salvador. The National Meteorological Institute reported that the hurricane' extratropical transition will take place overnight Thursday, with conditions forecasting strong winds gusting up to 50 mph and moderate rainfall totals through Friday morning in Central America; an advisory has been issued for parts of Mexico as a result.

"It's devastating," said Maria Sanchez, who watched the storm from her porch as it battered the coastal town where she was born over 50 years ago. "The waves were crashing right at our feet and I don't know how much more this community can take."

Nicaraguan President Danilo Medina expressed deep concern for his country: "This is an unprecedented disaster, which has already caused significant damage to infrastructure here in the eastern part of Nicaragua," he said. The government mobilized resources immediately after receiving reports from local authorities that over 50 homes were destroyed and roads became impassable due to flooding and landslides.

According to UN estimates, approximately one million people could be affected across all three nations in the hurricane's path. As of Wednesday morning around El Salvador had reported a total of seven confirmed fatalities with numerous injuries sustained amidst fallen trees and debris; emergency services are working round-the-clock to restore order throughout ravaged areas, including providing temporary shelter for displaced residents in local schools and other public buildings.

In response to the disaster declaration by Nicaragua's government on Tuesday evening President Medina urged national unity: "Our people are strong; we will overcome this together." At a press conference yesterday, El Salvadorian First Lady Lorena Fuenmayor reiterated that call for community solidarity as she visited areas hardest hit by flooding and landslides along coastal Guatemala.

"In times like these when life seems uncertain; we need each other now more than ever before," said the first lady, who was joined at her event in San Miguel with Nicaraguan officials seeking aid to begin a collaborative effort between all three countries impacted by this natural disaster that is expected to continue well into next week.

Local and international relief organizations have already begun coordinating efforts; USAID's Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance announced Wednesday morning they were providing $2 million in emergency funds along with search-and-rescue teams, medical supplies, food packages for displaced families as well as transportation and communication equipment to aid local responders on the ground throughout Central America's battered regions.

In El Salvador President Nayib Bukele also offered his condolences while stressing that "rebuilding our country will take time." The government has pledged upwards of $15 million in immediate disaster relief funds with emergency supplies like tarps, blankets and hygiene k
