In an unexpected turn of events in New Delhi on Tuesday, a massive fire engulfed historic buildings including part of the iconic Qutub Minar and nearby colonial structures dating back to British rule near India Gate. The blaze broke out at around 4:30 PM local time (IST) with an initial report suggesting that two individuals might have started the inferno unintentionally by discarding a lit cigarette butt in a prohibited area, as per authorities confirming investigations are ongoing to determine any negligence or foul play.


Emergency services were immediately dispatched at 4:35 PM IST and firefigpher officials stated that around two hundred personnel from the Delhi Fire Services have been working tirelessly since their arrival. "The scale of this fire is unprecedented, but we are confident in our team's skills," says Chief Fire Officer Sunil Sharma, adding to reports estimating damage at least 50 million Indian rupees (roughly $642,398).


Witness Aman Kumar recalls hearing the alarm shortly after lunch and seeing flames climbing up one of the minarets. "It was terrifying to see buildings I used to visit every week turn into a scene from an apocalyptic movie," he tells CNN-News18, adding that it's been challenging for his family who lives in nearby neighborhoods due to dust and ash fallout during rescue operations which continue late at night.


Safety concerns have prompted the evacuation of several residents from close by areas including Ashoka Park Extension and Rajpath Gardens, as per Delhi Police spokesperson Shobhit Saini: "While we are working on containment lines to prevent spreading flames, our primary concern is for those who have been displaced."


The Ministry of Culture has expressed its deepest regret at the loss and called upon citizens worldwide to stand with India during this time. As rescuers continue their work into Wednesday night, officials stress that full recovery could take years as they assess structural damage amid a backdrop of rising temperatures which have historically exacerbated fire behavior in South Asia's largest democracy: "The Delhi summer heat is certainly not helping us here," remarks Senior Fire Officer Vijay Mehta.

CNN-News18 seeks to bring updates as they become available regarding the cause, impact and recovery progress of this devastating blaze in New Delhi's historic core area that has caught many by surprise with its fury.
