In a series of coordinated attacks across Venezuela and Colombia on Thursday night, at least seven people have been injured in explosions that experts say are linked to local gang conflicts over control of the drug trade routes through South America's largest country by area—Venezuela. The violence erupted early this evening near La Guaira port city as authorities scrambled for a response amid concerns about an escalation following similar incidents in recent months, according to reports from both nations’ police forces and witnesses on the ground who spoke with CNN affiliate Unicamera and were heard by residents fearing further disruin.

"I never thought I'd see such a horrific thing happening right next door," lamented Mariana Rodriguez, 36 years old mother of three watching from her home on the hilltop with binoculars in hand just minutes before blast-time as she described witnessing what appeared to be an explosive device being hoisted onto a passing tractor. "It was terrifying."

Venezuela's Interior Minister, Danilo Medina has since announced increased security measures and patrol expansions in the region while Colombian President Ivan Duque condemned both acts of violence through joint statements shared today with officials from other countries affected by these attacks. "The safety of our communities is not negotiable," said a spokesman for Presidencia, Carlos Vargas during press conference alongside Venezuelan Interior Ministry representatives as they briefed reporters about what appears to be growing territorial disputes between cartels operating out of both nations' borders despite international pressure over drug trafficking and organized crime.

Medina revealed that his department has increased security presence along key roads leading into Caracas, where some believe the violence originates from a new power vacuum created by political instability within Venezuela itself alongside escalated tensions between rival criminal factions across both nations’ territories due in part to Colombian military interventions since 2018 designed primarily toward reducing coca production and dismantling drug cartels operating out of Colombia but spilling over into Venezuelan territory. "We are aware that some parties involved may attempt further escalation, which is why we have taken steps today to bolster our security forces," Medina explained during a hastily organized emergency meeting with his top advisors last night following three separate incidents of bombings targeting businesses and residences over the past two weeks.

Local residents who spoke candidly about recent events while expressing growing frustration at authorities for seemingly insufficient responses so far told CNN affiliate Unicamera that fear has spread among communities where once-familiar landscapes now resemble scenes from urbanized cities plagued by high crime rates. “The feeling of safety we used to have, gone,” said Raul Perez when asked about his community’s situation today after police knocked on doors seeking information following Thursday night's attack as part of their current sweep across the city targeting suspected gang members and anyone involved with drug trafficking.

While Colombian authorities have sought assistance from international allies including The United States, experts warn that last week’s UN Security Council vote condemning government actions against FARC dissidents while calling for humanitarian access does not address deeper issues of poverty and corruption contributing to the drug trade itself. “The root causes here go beyond simple law enforcement,” said Dr. Maria Gome
