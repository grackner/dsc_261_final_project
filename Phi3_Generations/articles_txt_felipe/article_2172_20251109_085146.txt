AUSTIN – Austin Rivers Jr., a rising star on his high school basketball team in Texas' capital city, collapsed during practice last Tuesday and was rushed to the hospital for emergency treatment of severe dehydration. The incident occurred at Robert Mueller High School around midday when he exhibited symptoms such as dizziness and extreme fatigue on the court – which led coach David Simmons to halt practice immediately and call an ambulance.

"I've never seen anything like it," said one of his teammates, who wishes to remain anonymous due to fears about their friendship being affected by this scare. "He was always so energetic – even through the long days on campus." 

Rivers had been training intensely for weeks in preparation for a major regional tournament happening next month; however, his coaches and trainers say he often skipped mandatory rest periods during practice sessions to push himself harder. Despite concerns raised by these reports about potential overtraining syndrome, which can lead not only to physical breakdown but also mental distress (including depression), Rivers' parents insist their son wanted the extra challenge of taking his game beyond high school basketball and that they hadn’t realized he was pushing himself too hard.

Experts say hydration is one aspect athletes often overlook – especially as we get into warmer months where heat exhaustion can become a serious concern for young people involved in sports without proper guidance on keeping themselves safe from adverse effects of exercise and sun exposure: "It's imperative that teenagers learn to listen to their bodies when it comes to taking breaks, staying hydrated during practices or games - they have no innate knowledge about self-care," stated Dr. Lisa Gomez, a sports medicine specialist at UT Health Austin who had reviewed the case and confirmed severe dehydration as an underlying factor in this incident – pointing out that Rivers was not consuming enough fluids before or during practice sessions due to his focus on other aspects of training like strengthening exercises: "Teenagers should be taught by their coaches about how important rest, nutrition and hydration are for maintaining good health while engaging in sports."

Rivers is currently recovering at Dell Children's Hospital where he will receive ongoing treatment to restore his electrolyte balance – including intravenous fluids administered regularly by the medical team. His family has expressed gratitude towards their school and staff for taking swift action when Rivers exhibited warning signs of dehydration, saying "As parents we were completely unaware that he could be pushing himself too hard - but now see how important it is to find a balance between dedication in pursuing goals while prioritizing overall health".

Rivers' coaches are undergoing training themselves on methods for preventing such occurrences among other team members. Meanwhile, Austin Rivers Jr.’s story serves as an essential reminder of the importance that athletes – particularly teenagers – understand how to take care of their bodies and listen when they need rest or fluids during intense workouts: "It's important for coaches not only to recognize signs of dehydration but also educate young players about proper hydration techniques," added Dr. Gomez, who would be offering additional talks on the topic at local schools in Austin as part of an effort towards promoting awareness regarding youth sports safety practices: "It
