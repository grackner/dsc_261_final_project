Former NBA star James Edwards has turned his focus to coaching and recently took over a struggling college team in Lexington, Kentucky at age 45. This seasoned player is known for once being the top scorer on an undefeated national championship-winning basketball team back in 2003 when he was just under ten years old – now seeking to pass his wisdom onto young aspirants by stepping into a more challenging arena: college ball. Edwards, who played collegiately at Duke University and later turned professional with the Miami Heat before moving on from the league in 2014 due to injuries sustained during play, now works as an assistant coach under well-respected head coach Mark Johnson at Transylvania College of Appalachian State.

Having taken over recently this summer after a rough start with four consecutive losses for the team – who had been 8–14 heading into his appointment - Edwards is determined to make positive changes both on and off court, focusing not only on skill development but also on life lessons like resilience. "I want these young men to know that no matter what happens in their lives outside of basketball they will always find a way back here," said James as he addressed the team during one of his first practices since becoming head coach last month, where players listened attentively and nodded along with some beaming smiles evident on faces.

Transylvania College is located just 15 miles southeast from Lexington's iconic Kentucky Derby race track - a mere blink away in the heart of bustling Bluegrass State renowned for producing world-class athletes across multiple sports disciplines including horse racing, swimming and soccer among others. Edwards is no stranger to this area having grown up playing alongside some prominent local legends during his youth before transitioning into professional basketball where he gained recognition in the big leagues as well as internationally while representing America on numerous occasions throughout high school years until turning pro after being selected 27th overall by Miami Heat from Harlem Village Academy High School for the NBDL draft back then.

In discussions with team members and colleagues regarding James Edwards' coaching philosophy, it becomes evident that he believes strongly in building a strong foundation of character within each player – something not easily quantified but essential to individual growth as well as collective success on court while also highlighting the importance of hard work both mentally and physically needed when dealing with pressure situations like big tournaments or high stakes matches where every decision could make all kinds difference between winning & losing for his squad.

While many college coaches have their unique ways to motivate players – some focusing more on strict discipline while others opting towards a friendlier approach - James seems set out with combining both methods together emphasizing consistency yet allowing room within boundaries that foster trust and respect between himself as head coach & each player under his wing. "I believe in setting high expectations, but also providing support when needed," he said during an interview at the college's gymnasium where practice was just getting started for another grueling session ahead of players who are visibly tired yet still committed to putting forth their utmost effort every day towards improvement despite tough early results thus far.

As we move forward with this new season under James Edwards' leadership, fans from around town and even beyond look on curiously awaiting how his youthful vigor paired up with practical knowledge may help transform the current squad into something great while reminiscing fond memories
