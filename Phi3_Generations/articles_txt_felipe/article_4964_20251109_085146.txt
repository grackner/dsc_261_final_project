Topic: Politics - CNN Polls

In a recent national survey conducted by CBS News and The New York Times, it has come to light that American citizens' trust in Congress is at its lowest point since polls began tracking this sentiment back in the late '70s. With over half of Americans expressing little or no faith in their elected officials’ ability to make substantial policy changes before year-end 2decade[1].

The nationwide poll found that only one third (34%) are hopeful for Congress' effectiveness, while a significant majority (68%) believe it is unlikely they will see meaningful reforms in the coming months. The disaffection dates back to President Joe Biden’s term when his approval rating plummeted from an initial 2017 high of 56%[2] and has been steadily declining since then, largely due to persistent legislative gridlock on key issues such as infrastructure spending, climate change policies, health care reforms,[3][4] immigration reform[5], gun control laws among others.

Dr. Jane Thompson, a political science professor at Harvard University and one of the analysts participating in discussions over these findings echoed similar sentiments saying “The current level of distrust is unprecedented compared to other presidencies”.[6]  This sentiment seems even stronger among younger Americans aged between 18-29, with just a quarter (25%) hoping for significant policy reforms before year’s end.

A representative from the Washington Post echoed these findings and suggested that “Lack of faith in Congress is rooted deeper issues such as polarization within Capitol Hill”.[7] The divide between Democrats, who largely favor progressive policies while Republicans tend to lean more conservative has often resulted in legislative standstills. 

Despite the lackluster sentiment towards their representatives’ actions at Congress and even Biden himself[8], there appears a glimmer of hope amongst some American citizens. A recent interview with an undecided voter from Georgia suggested “Even though I don't fully trust my government, I still feel that each citizen has the power to enact change by actively participating in democracy through voting or advocacy”.[9]

The impact of this disaffection may be far-reaching affecting not only policy developments but also voter turnout for midterms next year and even general elections. Political analysts anticipate that if the trend continues, it could potentially trigger shifts in party dynamics with implications to local and national politics alike[10]. 

These findings serve as a call-to-action not only towards our representatives but also ourselves - reminding us of democracy’s essence: Our elected officials are accountable directly to the citizens they represent. Now, more than ever, it's important that we remain informed and actively participate in shaping policies through voting or advocacy at every level.[11]
