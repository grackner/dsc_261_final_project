“In the US it’s still unclear whether we will have normal or restricted entry to Europe this year,” said Robert Reiter of Travel Insure UK in an interview with CBS MoneyWatch back in September when restrictions were announced at a White House briefing, adding that demand for travel insurance has surged since then.
