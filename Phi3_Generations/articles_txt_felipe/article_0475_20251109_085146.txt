A mysterious unexploded World War II bomb was discovered in a public park on Tuesday morning by children near downtown New York City's financial district at Fulton Street and Broadway around the time of sunset, officials announced Wednesday afternoon after an extensive search. The grim find occurred just hours before Mayor Bill de Blasio declared that all remaining land mines dating back to conflicts in other parts of the world would be cleared from New York City's parks by summer 2curiosity is piqued, and concern among parents grows as more children discover unexploded war relics on their daily walks.

Mayor de Blasio immediately activated bomb disposal experts to render the hazardous device safe once it was located in a playground surrounded by high-rise buildings near Penn Station and Wall Street—areas densely packed with pedestrians, including schoolchildren on their way home for lunch. "The safety of our citizens is paramount," said de Blasio's spokesperson at the time when initial reports began circulating in social media about children near Central Park unearthing a rusted artifact while playing hide-and-seek around noon Wednesday, prompting an urgent call for assistance from park officials.

"I knew something was up when my 8-year-old son refused to play that game anymore," shared Angela Smithson of Brooklyn Heights about how she found out about the dangerous object in her neighborhood on Tuesday morning while jogging with her three kids near Grant's and Greenwich streets around lunchtime. She immediately contacted authorities, fearing for her children's safety after hearing rumors circulating among parents regarding similar incidents happening across other borough parks during routine trips throughout the city on weekends or school breaks where families typically enjoy picnics alongside kids running wild in an open green space with little supervision.

New York City Police Department (NYPD) officers cordoned off part of a grassy area near Broadway, and bomb disposal experts were brought into action to ensure the safety hazard is neutralized without further risking anyone's life or property damage while waiting for confirmation from authorities regarding how long this foreign object has been buried beneath layers upon layers of history underfoot among those very same paths where generations have passed since President Harry Truman signed an executive order on October 9, 1945—more than a decade after the end of hostilities between nations claiming victory over Nazi Germany and Japan during World War II's most decisive battles.

"There are still remnants from WWII littered around in parks across New York City due to incomplete clearance efforts following The Blitzkrieg, the largest aerial bombardment campaign ever conducted against civilians by Germany and its Axis allies that ravaged much of Europe between September 1939 through May 1945," stated NYPD chief inspector Robert Higgins while addressing concerned parents during a press conference in City Hall on Wednesday afternoon. "Although we've made significant progress over the years, thousands upon thousands are still out there waiting to be found."

The unexploded device was safely detonated at 4:15 PM EST yesterday by experts from Metropolitan Explosive Disposal Service (MEDS), which specializes in rendering dangerous objects harmless through controlled explosions conducted
