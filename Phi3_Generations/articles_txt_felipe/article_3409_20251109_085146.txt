Severan College basketball team triumphed with a narrow victory over Oxford High School yesterday in an intense Friday night match that came down to the wire at Wellington Arena. The game concluded just as play resumed following halftime, when Sophia Lee scored her second three-pointer of the contest within seconds after regaining possession behind her back for Travis Smith to set up a layup. 


"It was one nail-biting finish from beginning to end," remarked Coach Mitchell Brown as he watched his players celebrate their hard-earned victory against Oxford, who had previously been undefeated this season under the stellar guidance of head coach Angela Price. "These boys have learned not only how to win on the court but also about teamwork and perseverance," added Coach Brown during a postgame press conference held at Wellington Arena where he announced plans for next month's regional playoffs with Oxford as their primary adversary, set two weeks from now.


Sophia Lee credited her teammates for boosting morale after the halftime lead narrowed to just 10 points by this point of gameplay amidst a backdrop of growing apprehension and determination evident across both teams' faces as they traded baskets with vigor. In an impassioned response, Coach Price affirmed her team would continue focusing on strategy improvements during halftime break to make necessary adjustments against the resilient Sevan College squad.


"We respect their ability and are motivated by our desire for victory," said one Oxford player later observed in a postgame interview with Echo Sports Magazine, hinting at fierce competition ahead as both schools aim not only for glory but also to prove themselves among the most formidable basketball programs this season. The regional playoffs next month will provide an opportunity for Southeastern School students and alumni across three separate sports—basketball, soccer, and swimming - with local talent vying for spots on national teams in each respective discipline as part of a broader celebration of athletic excellence.


As the Sevan College team dispersed from Wellington Arena following their victory parade down Main Street this evening at 6:30 pm, both schools have been unanimously praised for promoting sportssmanship and camaraderie through healthy competition while emphasizing on academics by awarding varsity letters of achievement to top performers.
