SAN FRANCISCO — AMC Theaters will not allow fans to attend live performances at their venues again until further notice due to continuing health risks associated with COVID-19. This decision, announced on June 27th by the company'selfranchised CEO Seth Rosenthal comes after a recent surge in local coronavirus cases has put California under new statewide restrictions imposed at midnight last night that could lead to closures if certain benchmarks are not met.

"As much as we all yearn for the return of live entertainment, we simply can't take this risk any longer," said Rosenthal during a news conference held today in Los Angeles where he spoke with several members from AMC Entertainment Group about their latest policies and restrictions amidst the ongoing pandemic. "Our top priority right now is ensuring that everyone enjoys movies safely, not just for ourselves but also our audience."

Since reopening last summer following initial lockdowns back in March 2020, AMC Theaters have struggled to maintain safe operations due largely to a resurgence of COVID-19 cases across California. In recent months alone, more than half a million new positive tests were reported statewide as case rates climbed higher daily for weeks on end - prompting officials like Dr Anthony Fauci Md's chief medical adviser urging people nationwide to remain cautious amidst fear of further spread and potential mutations that could lead not only more hospitalizations but also fatalities among unvaccinated individuals.

CNN reports theaters across California have taken similar measures as AMC, including reduced capacity limits or closing entirely depending on how closely they follow state guidelines set forth by Governor Gavin Newsom's office which took effect last night under Executive Order BAN92765 that stipulates specific criteria before businesses can reopen again.

In the city of Los Angeles alone, health officials recorded 30 new coronavirus cases within just one hour yesterday afternoon as hospitalizations continue to rise with more than four dozen COVID-19 patients currently occupying beds in local intensive care units according a representative speaking on behalf of LA County Public Health Dept during Tuesday's briefing held by county health officials. 

Dr Lina White, an infectious disease specialist at UCLA Medical Center shared her concerns about returning to live performances while emphasizing the need for vaccination in curbing further transmission saying "it is essential that we prioritize safety above all else and ensure everyone who plans on attending a movie sees its importance firsthand."

With AMC Theaters leading by example, it seems unlikely California residents can expect to see live shows anytime soon until case numbers drop sufficiently enough for state officials approvals according to Mayor London Breed's office. But with most adult Californians now fully vaccinated against COVID-19 since late last summer after millions had signed up through several mass rollout sites across the city such as LA County Coliseum or San Francisco City Hall, hopes remain high that soon entertainment venues may welcome back audiences without fear of risking public health.
