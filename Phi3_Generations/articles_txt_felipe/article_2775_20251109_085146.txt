In a stunning upset during last night's NHL game between the Los Angeles Kings and Anaheim Ducks at the Honda Center in Anaheim on February 12th, an underdog hockey player from San Francisco delivered what could be considered one of history'in most shocking victories. At just 30 years old, goalkeeper Jack Thompson has already carved out a niche for himself as a dark horse with the potential to become his team’s next big star on ice.


Jack had previously played for amateur teams around Los Angeles and never imagined that he would get this opportunity when an unexpected injury opened up a roster spot in San Francisco's lineup, where Jack is currently playing as back-up goaltender to the current starter Chris Miller. With only 20 professional games under his belt, Thompson has already impressed with his quick reflexes and strong saves at Anaheim Ducks’ top scoring team known for their offensive prowess led by star player Mike Anderson who scored a record-breaking 36 goals this season in just the regular season alone.


In yesterday's game, Thompson faced an unexpected challenge when he had to defend against one of the most feared shots on ice — Miller’s powerful slapshot from close range that always left spectators holding their breath every time it happened throughout his rookie year with Los Angeles Kings two seasons ago. With just over 16 minutes into game four, and fans already restless after a series of back-and-forth battles on the ice had led to an emptying arena before Jack's position in goal was even up for debate, he found himself facing this very shot with Miller hot on his tail.


"I felt like I got one step ahead," Thompson admitted afterward as Ducks coach Dave Peterson watched from a nearby bench and King players cheered him on when the win finally came down to last-second saves that no other goalie in either team had made throughout this season so far. “When Jack put his mind into it, he never let go."

Thompson's victory is already sparking conversations about what role — if any—he could play on an NHL roster moving forward and whether a fresh start with the San Francisco Kings can launch him onto stardom as some fans hope. "It’s just fantastic to see young talent making waves in our league, but it will take time for Jack Thompson's journey towards becoming one of this country's top goaltenders," said NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman after the game concluded with a scoreboard reading 2-1 LA Kings. "We wish him and his team all success as they continue to compete in their division."

Next steps for Jack are yet uncertain, but one thing is clear: he has already etched himself into hockey history — whether on an NHL roster or not remains to be seen .
