India is witnessing a surge in cyberattacks targeting financial institutions across the country as reported by multiple agencies on March 30th, with an estimated attack rate increasing to five times since early February when it was first noticed nationwide. The United States Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has issued a warning about sophisticated ransomware campaigns against India's banking sector that could potentially cripple financial services within weeks if not addressed promptly, as per the latest findings released this Monday. 

According to cybersecurity experts from New Delhi Cybercrime Bureau (NDCB), a large-scale attack infiltrated India's largest banking institutions on March 29th, compromising over one million customer accounts by leveraging weak network defenses and poor security protocols. "The malware employed here not only encrypts data but also threatens to disrupt services unless the ransom is paid within a specified deadline," warned Arjun Mishra, head of NDCB's Cyber Threat Intelligence Unit during an interview with Bloomberg TV. The perpetrators have been identified as actors from Eastern Europe and South Asia - marking them as international cybercriminals who are not deterred by recent global efforts to crack down on digital fraud, he added.

The surge in attacks comes amid concerns about India's readiness for a potential economic slowdown that may follow the upcoming general election held nationwide next month and subsequent fiscal policy changes implemented post-election. Several leading bank executives have expressed worries over their institutions’ preparedness to deal with such sophisticated cyberthreats in an interview conducted by ET this week, stating they were prioritizing internal system upgrades that are projected to take at least three months before full implementation across all branches.

"We've been working tirelessly for the last two weeks with our IT team and international cybersecurity partners like CISA," said Rajesh Malhotra, managing director of Banker Trust in New Delhi when contacted by CNN-News18 yesterday afternoon. "While we have managed to thwart several attempted attacks since February 7th thanks to early warnings from Indian intelligence and global cybersecurity agencies." He went on to add that his bank is now implementing stringent network security measures, including multi-factor authentication protocols for customers accessing their accounts online or remotely.

CISA warned against ransom payments as they provide financial motivation behind such attacks and discourage the reporting of cybercrime incidents to authorities in order to avoid detection while continuing their illic0it activities. "It's crucial that victims refrain from making payment demands, even under duress," stated Mishra Krishnan, deputy director for national counterintelligence at CISA during an interview with the New York Times this morning. Experts urged Indian banks and financial institutions to collaborate closely in sharing information about attempted attacks and cybersecurity best practices across their networks while investing heavily into developing more robust systems that can defend against evolving threats effectively without relying on external assistance from international agencies as much possible, given the recent global pandemic.
