A massive earthquake measuring a magnitude of 7.8 hit Italy late Monday night near Friuli Venezia Giulia region close to Slovenian border and Montenegro coastline at about 10:50 pm local time (UTC+2). The quake prompted immediate evacuations from affected areas, with over two thousand individuals reported as displaced.


"The tremors were felt across multiple countries; we're coordinating relief efforts," said EU Civil Protection Coordinator Thalia Katsoumani to a group of concerned citizens in the epicenter city of Udine. "We have sent rescue teams and are working with local authorities."


Emergency services were swiftly on scene, but preliminary reports suggest that there has been significant damage to infrastructure including roads, bridges, railway lines, and power networks within a radius encompassing the town of Pordenone. The earthquake struck just 12 miles from Lake Garda' end at Udine Airport with seismic activity recorded as far away as Croatia and Albania.


"The aftershocks are still frequent," stated Dr. Marco Silvestri, a geologist stationed in Italy who has studied the region for decades. "We need to monitor these tremors closely." Local historian Elisa Bianchi commented on past earthquakes affecting Udine and surrounding towns: "These areas have faced seismic activity before; this is not new but always devastating nonetheless."


In a statement, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi said that the government was taking all necessary measures to ensure people's safety. He added, "We are deploying resources and working with international partners for immediate assistance.” Experts from around Europe have been dispatched alongside their counterparts in Italy after requests were made over social media channels by citizens eager to assist those affected abroad.


Given the scale of this natural disaster, multiple countries bordering these regions have expressed support for Italian authorities and are offering on-the-ground assistance as needed. With more than 50 confirmed fatalities nationwide following aftershocks that persisted late into Tuesday night, many families remain in temporary shelters while officials continue to search for survivors trapped under collapsed buildings or submerged by landslides triggered by the quake's shock waves.


The Italian National Institute of Geophysics and Vulcanology has warned that aftershock sequences could last up to three months, urging continued vigilance among residents in already fragile structures across Friuli Venezia Giulia province. "Our priority is the safety of our citizens," said Assessor Andrea Ricciardi from the City Hall at Trieste when asked about future reconstruction efforts and support for displaced families:

"We are here to help, as we always do in times like these."
