A recent trend is sweeping across high-profile events and fashion weeks as designers incorporate unconventional materials into their luxurious designs: latex clothing made from human skin obtained through consensual donations of deceased loved ones' tissue samples (commonly referred to as "skin gowns"). This unique approach has sparked widespread debate among fashion aficionados and ethicists alike, centering on the fine line between artistic expression and potential cultural insensitivity.

The idea behind these striking pieces is rooted in a personal loss experienced by Parisian designer Elise Dumas during her youth when she lost both parents at an early age to terminal illnesses that ravaged their bodies rapidly. Inspired by the desire to honor them while embracing life itself, Dumas turned towards this unconventional method of commemorating loved ones' physical essence through fashion design after attending a medical conference where tissue preservation and donation were discussed extensively in 2021. Since then, she has worked with dermatologists to perfect her techniques that involve the extraction of collagen fibers from human skin under strict ethical guidelines before integrating them into exclusive custom-made garments for a select clientele who appreciate this blend of fashion and memory preservation (according to Dumas, "I am not exploiting grief but transforming it into artistic expression that gives my designs character.").

In April 2023, at Paris Fashion Week's closing event hosted by the French Ministry for Culture under Minister Francois Leblanc’s oversight (Leblanc emphasized his commitment to showcasing innovative fashion while assuring ethical conduct and respect), Dumas unveiled her latest collection titled 'Etched In Likeness.' The runway featured multiple skins gown models with varying degrees of transparency, hues that matched the natural tones found in human skin before extraction (a color-matched dermatologist confirms: "The process maintains a realistic appearance while ensuring no discomfort for both donors and wearers."). The collection immediately received significant attention from fashion critics as well as concerns about cultural appropriation raised by various groups who question the ethical implications of this form of expression (the debate remains unresolved with ongoing discussions regarding consent, memorialization practices among loved ones left behind after deaths caused due to terminal illnesses).

Despite differing opinions across society and within academic circles studying cultural appropriation or commemoration through fashion choices made by the living as a homage for those who have passed away from severe diseases (an anthropologist notes: "It's essential to understand individual intentions when analyzing acts of memorialization."), Dumas has garnered international acclaim since introducing her unique concept. In interviews, she speaks passionately about empowerment and personal healing through creative processes whereby one can transform grief into something tangible; however, many argue that the emotional aspect tied to loss could be overshadowing by controversies surrounding this particular trend (Dumas has responded: "I always sought permission from families prior before creating any piece involving their loved ones' donations").

With fashion evolving rapidly and designers constantly pushing boundaries in style, luxury brands are expected to take note of the discussions sparked by Dumas’ skin gown collection. Ethicists call for
