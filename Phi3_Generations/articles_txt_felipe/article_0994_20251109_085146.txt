In a groundbredependent initiative to attract tourists while safeguarding its rich cultural heritage and pristine environment, Ethiopia recently announced plans for an ambitious eco-tourism project in the region of Lalibela, dating back almost one thousand years. Set to open next year, visitors will have unparalleled access to these ancient rock-hewn churches known as 'monolithic religious structures', a UNESCO World Heritage site since 1988.

Ethiopia's Minister of Cultural Affairs and Tourism Demeke Taye expressed his vision for the project during yesterday’s press conference in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. "Our aim is not only to bring people from all corners of the globe but also inspire them with our history," he said while unveiling a model replica inside Lalibela's St. George Monastery where meetings took place.

Experts believe that Ethiopia’s decision, which follows China and South Korea in implementing such an approach to tourism development could help preserve the unique cultural landmarks of this largely Christian nation while creating jobs for locals as well increasing overall revenue from travelers entering through its borders annually by 20%.

One local guide who has been working at Lalibela's site since before she can even remember now feels hopeful about her future thanks to the project. "I am so excited, because this means more job opportunities for us locals and better resources with which we could share our incredible history," says Fatima Yacobu of Addis Ababa as tears shimmer in his eyes during an interview on CNN Newsroom earlier today.

Another expert adds that the project also aims to create educational programs focusing primarily on teaching tourists about environmental conservation and cultural preservation principles while they are visiting Lalibela's sacred grounds, "This is not just another sightseeing venture; it’s meant for people who want knowledge too," says Dr. Tekeste Kata of Ethiopia's National Museum told CNN Newsroom during a trip to the region last week when she saw some construction work taking place at Lalibela monasteries ahead of next year's official opening date scheduled in September 2023 - an important milestone for both tourism and cultural preservation efforts within Ethiopia as well.

As plans continue, locals like Yacobu hope the project will not only bring more attention to Lalibela but also improve their quality of life while sharing with visitors centuries-old traditions etched into stone walls carved by hand hundreds and maybe even thousands of years ago when King Lalibela decided he wanted an entire city fit for God himself.

Ethiopia has already started the groundwork in some areas where they plan to build new accommodations, visitor centers with guided tour services offering tours that combine history lessons about rock-hewn churches and environmental education as part of their programmes highlighting sustainable development principles within these ancient grounds under strict protection regulations imposed by the Ethiopian government.

It remains to be seen how visitors, both internationals travelers seeking cultural enrichment experiences on holiday or religious pilgrimages may respond once they have experienced this unique way of exploring one's faith through artistic expression while respecting local customs and traditions like many did during recent visits by diplomats from various nations before Ethiopia even un
