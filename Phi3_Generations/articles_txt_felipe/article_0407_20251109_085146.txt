In a dramatic turn of events in Myanmar's Rangoon, authorities on Monday discovered a long-forgotten minefield near an unfinished military base along the Irrawaddy River basin; reports indicate that at least two soldiers have lost limbs as a result. This is not only reminding us of old wartime dangers but also casting doubt over decades' worth of disarmament efforts in Southeast Asia, leading to an immediate and full-scale international humanitarian response being called for by both local leaders and global partners alike – including the UN Secretary-General António Guterres who expressed profound regret at these "avoidable injuries" due to neglected landmines.

The scene of horror unfolding on an unassuming stretch near the Rangoon's Hpa-an suburb had local residents bewildered by this grim reminder that they live above a lethal legacy left behind in conflicts past – most notably, from the time when Myanmar was known as Burma during World War II and again throughout much of its military dictatorship era between 1962-2011. While details surrounding this recent find remain scarce at present, it appears to be a mix of improperly disarmed landmines from the previous regime mixed in with relics dating back as far as WWII which have been carelessly left by wartime forces decades ago and poor record-keeping systems since.

A local villager, 60-year old Maung Tun Win shared his shock at learning about this deadly discovery; he said "I never knew there were such things here in my backyard! My family was just trying to work on our rice paddies when suddenly we heard an explosion. We've been living above a ticking time bomb for years." He recalled the recent history of his homeland, one rife with political instability and numerous conflicts between various ethnic groups seeking self-determination – some armed struggle continues even today against what they perceive as military occupation.

Myanmar's Directorate of Immigration Office in Rangoon responded to the tragedy stating "The tragic loss of life resulting from these minefields is a clear indication that urgent action needs to be taken immediately; we cannot afford another avoidable injury like this happening again". It remains unclear what will become next after Myanmar's government acknowledges responsibility for safe disarmament, but the UN Secretary-General António Guterres has already called an emergency meeting of world leaders at U.N.’s headquarters in New York on Wednesday to discuss a coordinated international effort toward landmine clearance – including funding and technical expertise exchange programs with countries such as Canada that have had successes overseas; the UK Foreign Office is also urging their citizens not to travel near minefields for fear of injury.

Meanwhile, non-governmental organizations like International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and Halo Trust are ready to assist Myanmar's local authorities in clearing these devices; this incident could become a catalyst sparking needed global attention towards forgotten landmines worldwide where they linger dangerously near civilian populations, but also offer an opportunity for countries around the globe – including those that suffered from such blunders themselves like Cambodia and Afghanistan – to come together in ensuring never again will anyone lose a limb needlessly
