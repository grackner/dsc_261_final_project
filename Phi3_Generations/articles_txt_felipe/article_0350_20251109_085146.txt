Topic: Style - Beauty

In a city known for its vibrant fashion scene and celebrated beauty standards, New York City's elite have started gravitating towards an unconventional style trend: natural hair textures without manipulation or chemical treatments—an embodiment of the new era in Style - Beauty. This shift is seen as a response to growing health concerns related to traditional hairstyling and has been rapidly adopted over the past year, with experts noting an increase by 40% amongst New York's women compared to five years ago (The Fashion Institute of Style).


According to Jane Smith, Director at Salon Liberated Locks in Manhattan: "We used to see every other client request chemical straightening or curling. Now we mostly get requests for haircuts and styling services that embrace the natural texture." The phenomenon has been attributed not only as a health movement but also an empowering way of celebrating diversity within beauty norms, making waves beyond just hair industry experts who see this trend growing worldwide.


Amidst these developments is Maria Gonzaleenz, a first-generation Mexican American from Queens whose journey has inspired many: "I've always been proud to embrace my natural curls as part of my cultural heritage," she shared in an interview last weekend at the annual Style Expo. Her testimony resonated with thousands who have begun exploring their roots and challenging beauty stereotypes, leading experts like Dr. Lucy Wang (Dermatology Department - New York University) to comment: "We're witnessing a significant cultural shift that is healthier for both individuals and the environment."


As this natural hair trend continues its ascent in urban centers worldwide, organizations are starting to take note with local initiatives aimed at supporting brands promoting sustainable fashion practices. With New York setting an example of change within a globalized city known for influencing beauty standards around the globe, many wonder what this might mean for future trends and how our approach towards personal style will continue evolving as we step into a more inclusive era in Style - Beauty.
