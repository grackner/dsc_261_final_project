BEIJING, CHINA – A local tech firm has announced plans to develop a cutting-edge surveillin system across major Chinese cities starting in April next year as part of an initiative led by the Ministry of Public Security (MPS). The state-run newspaper Global Times reports that this will enhance monitoring capabilities and ensure public safety against potential threats.

China's push towards a more secure nation comes at 20 companies, starting with major tech firms like Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA) to lesser-known local startups. The surveillin project targets areas of high pedestrian traffic and is aimed toward preventing crime before it happens by analyzing patterns using artificial intelligence algorithms, according to the MPS statement made on Tuesday via their official Weibo account (@gmtnews).

“Our country faces multiple security threats that need addressing at every turn," said Minister of Public Security Zhao Kezhi. "We will use cutting-edge technology and expertise, working hand in hand with local law enforcement agencies to make China more secure." 

As part of the surveillin program's implementation phase, tech company ByteDance has been selected as a partner by MPS for developing AI tools that can identify suspicious behaviors or objects without human intervention. The project will span three years and cost an estimated $750 million in government funds along with private investments from companies like Tencent Holdings Limited (Hong Kong: 700) and Ping An Insurance Group Company Limited, listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange under ticker symbol368.

"This is not just about enhancing security; it’s also an opportunity to leverage technology in better ways," said Wei Lijie, CEO of ByteDance and a MPS adviser as part of this strategic initiative led by Zhao Kezhi's ministry. "We need smarter systems that can work autonomously for us."

The surveillin system will be installed in various public places like train stations, airports, shopping malls and tourist hotspots across major cities such as Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Tianjin, Xi'an, among others. As part of the project rollout plan scheduled to commence in April 2023, officials aimed at having a presence within these areas by September next year while expanding coverage gradually nationwide with full deployment expected by May 2025.

"We understand that surveillance raises concerns regarding privacy rights," said Yang Yu, Director of the Legal Affairs Bureau for MPS in an official statement last month cited on People's Daily website under its section 'Letters and Notes.' "The goal is to maintain a reasonable balance between security measures taken by authorities and individual freedoms while ensuring public safety."

Reactions so far from civil rights activists, academics specializing in humanities such as Dr. Li Mingxia of Peking University who recently published research on surveillance societies indicate that the project has raised eyebrows across different groups: 

“We are not opposed to improving security measures but there is a need for clear boundaries and regulations," she said in an interview with Xinhua news agency last weekend. "Excessive surveillance can lead towards viol
