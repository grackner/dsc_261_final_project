A major study on processed meats and heart health was released by a team of renowned cardiologists from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore yesterday afternoon. The research focused specifically on the risks posed to individuals consuming bacon, sausages, hot dogs, ham, corned beef, pastrami or salami regularly when it came to developing heart-related issues over time.

According to data compiled by a team of experts at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and the Bloomberg School for Public Health in Baltimore, those who consume even just one processed meat item daily could be increasing their risk of cardiovascular problems. The study reveals that people consuming these meats have an increased chance of heart disease by 42% over a ten-year period.

"These findings are quite alarming as bacon is often viewed as harmless to one's health," said Dr. Jennifer Smith, the lead researcher on this study and associate professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine who specializes in studying heart disease risk factors linked with food consumption patterns among different demographics around America."

The comprehensive report investigated a group of 20,000 middle-aged adults from various socioeconomic backgrounds living across the United States over ten years. Participants who consumed more than one processed meat meal per week had an increased risk for heart disease by as much as two to three times compared with those who rarely or never ate these food items, according to statistics gathered from various sources such as patient records and dietary logs submitted at the start of study.

The lead author said that "our research suggests avoiding processed meats entirely may be more beneficial than any potential substitution alternative." He went on to advise individuals who enjoy bacon or sausage dishes occasionally should consider healthier alternatives, such as lean grilled chicken breasts instead for their next barbeque.

Experts are encouraging the government and food industry stakeholders alike to focus attention towards creating an awareness campaign about this growing threat from processed meats in America's diet amongst millions of Americans who indulge frequently without understanding these findings could alter not just their health trajectory, but also potentially benefit those at risk.

In response to the report’s release, officials within Baltimore City have announced plans for a public information campaign targeting people and institutions known or thought to regularly consume processed meats as part of dietary habits while stressing that moderation can be key when making changes without drastically altering one's lifestyle.

Dr. Samuel Thompson, Mayor Murphy’s health commissioner said in a statement: "We recognize the importance of balanced eating and believe these findings provide an opportunity for us to explore alternatives that may reduce individuals’ exposure risks while maintaining cultural food practices across diverse communities herein."
