A powerful hurricane with wind speeds exceeding 150 mph made landfall in Louisiana yesterday evening, causing widespdeed devastation and prompting a national emergency declaration by President Biden. Hurricane Ida reached its peak intensity near the Gulf of Mexico before heading ashore southeast of New Orleans at around 7 pm local time (CDT). As per initial assessments from The National Weather Service, millions are under mandatory evacuation orders while several thousand homes have been reported as flooded or severely damaged in the hardest-hit areas.

"Ida has brought unprecedented destruction," says Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards during a press conference at 8 pm CDT yesterday evening from Baton Rouge, where he and federal officials are coordinating disaster response efforts with President Biden's administration on standby for deployment to the state. "We will need help beyond our own resources in this recovery effort."

The Louisiana National Guard has been activated along with FEMA teams arriving from across America to assist in search, rescue and clean-up operations as they work around the clock alongside local emergency services personnel already on standby for such an event. The hurricane warnings were issued well ahead of time by meteorologists who had predicted a high chance for extreme weather due to warming sea surface temperatures fueled partly by human activities, leading experts like Dr James Hansen at Columbia University's Earth Institute to caution governments about increasingly frequent and intense hurricanes.

"The current climate crisis is real; we cannot deny that our actions are impacting the planet," says Jim Tracy from The National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) while discussing Ida's ferocity with CNN earlier today at a temporary command center set up on St. Tammany Parish near New Orleans after surveying damaged areas first-hand yesterday morning alongside local officials and emergency personnel. "We are witnessing more powerful storm surges, higher peak rainfall amounts in tropical cyclones as wells larger area of impact because these weather systems have access to a greater reserve pool of warm water."

The full scope of damage continues to be assessed throughout affected regions with reports estimating billions worth properties damaged or destroyed. Power is still out for nearly 2 million customers across southeastern Louisiana while local drainage canals and streets are severely flooded after an intense rainfall rate exceeding two inches per hour at times during the storm's passage yesterday evening through early today morning hours here in New Orleans alone; multiple feet of standing water remains present around some areas throughout several parishes which still lie under mandatory evacuation orders from FEMA.

As officials continue to evaluate Ida's impact on this catastrophic level, President Biden announced a national emergency declaration last night as he visited Baton Rouge where his administration is coordinating response efforts alongside the state governor and first responders; federal resources will soon begin arriving in Louisiana including several thousand Army National Guard troops along with additional FEMA personnel. "We are rallying all available resources to help those affected by this natural disaster," Biden tells reporters outside Baton Rouge's Fairground Arena surrounded by local dignitaries while observing massive piles of relief supplies and other necessary equipment already arriving from various parts across America as part of the federal response plan.
