NYC Chefs Pledge to Source Locally Amid Rising Sea Level Projections – By Emma Rodriguez and Alex Thompson for CNN

New York City, NY - In response to the growing threat of climate change and its impact on global food security, a group of leading chefs in New York pledged this weekend at Union Square Park that all dishes served will exclusively come from local suppliers by 2030. The initiative comes as scientists predict sea levels could rise between one to four feet globally over the next century due to climate change, threatening coastal agricultural production and access in several key food-producing regions around the world including vital areas of Latin America that have traditionally supplied New York with produce such as avocados.

Chef Marco Rossi spearheaded this movement after witnessing firsthand how his favorite farm was struggling amidst increasingly unpredictable weather patterns and flooding events over recent years due to rising sea levels – a worry shared by many of his peers in the food industry across New York City (NYC). "We all rely on imports for some ingredients, but with this shift towards more extreme climate conditions worldwide, we need to adapt our practices now," said Rossi.

This new sustainability-focused directive follows a growing movement of chefs and restaurateurs across the country taking steps toward mitigating their carbon footprint in hopes of combatting global warming' endangerment. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio praised this move, saying "By supporting local growers here at home, we strengthen our city’s food ecosystem while reducing transportation emissions that contribute significantly to climate change."

Experts predict the impact of rising sea levels could lead to a 2% drop in global agricultural output by mid-century due to saltwater intrusion into freshwater systems and coastal flooding. This, combined with other food security concerns related to water scarcity exacerbated by climate change – such as droughts affecting crop yields across the globe - has been a driving force behind this decision among NYC chefs.

"Adaptation is key here," said Dr. Rachel Green, Environmental Scientist and Adjunct Professor of Sustainability at Columbia University's School of International Affairs who specializes in food systems affected by climate change impacts like sea level rise (SLR). "Not only can sourcing locally help reduce some emissions related to transportation – but it also supports small-scale farmers that are already working hard and finding innovative ways to adapt their practices amid changing conditions. It's a win-win."

The chefs pledge follows similar commitments made in California where the state has passed legislation requiring all food sold in grocery stores be sourced from within 200 miles of its borders – though critics argue this could hurt consumers by limiting choice and driving up prices. However, NYC restaurateurs believe their approach can strike a balance between maintaining culinary diversity while reducing the carbon footprint associated with long-distance transportation needed to access some ingredients now typically sourced overseas – such as certain varieties of produce currently exported from Latin America or Asia.

"We're excited about this challenge ahead, but also mindful that it will require continuous dialogue and collaboration across the food industry," said Rossi during a press conference at Union Square Park where several prominent NYC restaurateurs rallied
