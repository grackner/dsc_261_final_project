In a major military development in Syria's ongoing conflict, Turkish forces have struck at what they claim to be an Iranian-backed militia training camp near Aleppo this morning. The raid comes amid escalating tensions between Turkey and its neighbors who suspect Tehran of supporting extremist groups within the region.

Turkish officials confirmed that their special forces conducted a swift incursion into Syria, targeting infrastructure related to what they describe as an Iranian proxy group operating in opposition-controlled territory. The camp was located approximately 10 miles northwest of Aleppo city center near Marea village since September last year and has been the focus of international scrutinies for alleged ties with Tehran's paramilitary networks, according to regional experts.

"We have a clear mandate from our government," said one Turkish official involved in planning this operation who insisted on anonymity because he could not speak publicly as Turkey has no embassy or diplomatic presence inside Syria due to the civil war which erupted over eight years ago when Bashar al-Assad rose against a popular uprising. "We must take decisive action in response to Iranian influence that threatens our national security."

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has consistently blamed Tehran for funding and arming militants fighting on Syrian soil since the 2016 crackdown against protesters supporting his failed coup attempt then condemned: "We have had enough of this insidious support from across borders."

The Turkish military did not immediately respond to requests seeking comment. Iran, which has denied any involvement in training militants or providing financial aid for armed groups within Syria - a country it considers its ally and defender against Western imperialism throughout the 20th century- also remained silent on this report despite acknowledging Turkish forces' incursions into southern parts of Idlib province earlier last month.

Syrian government officials warned that such strikes could have dire consequences for civilians trapped in besieged cities under siege by rebel fighters supported through proxy networks like Hezbollah and al-Qaeda affiliate groups funded largely via Iraq's Shia militias backed by Iran.

The UN said 30,000 people are trapped in Idlib governorate after Turkish forces pushed Syrian opposition fighters out of enclaves last month while Russian airstrikes prevent rebel groups from launching attacks against the central government and international aid convoys entering besieged areas to deliver food supplies.

The US, which brokered an October 7 deal between Turkey and Russia restricting all hostilities except for localized conflict around Idlib city since Assad regained control over much of Syrian territory including Aleppo by August last year during a military offensive that displaced millions from their homes - backs efforts led by the Astana guarantors, which include Iran and Russia to resolve this protracted crisis through diplomatic channels.

"We will continue our calls for dialogue between all parties involved," said US Special Envoy for Syria James Jeffrey in a statement read during today's press briefing at his office near the Pentagon where he serves as an adviser on national security issues relating to regional stability and diplomacy. "Our goal remains unconditional, broad-based ceasefire across
