In a shocking turn of events in New Orleans on Tuesday evening, authorities responded to reports of unidentified flying objects darting across city streets and near-miss incidents with pedestrians. Witnesses describe vivid greenish lights dancing through the night sky just after midnight as these curious entities seemed attracted particularly towards areas around Bourbon Street – a central tourist hub famous for its lively music scene even at late hours.


"The first sighting occurred near Jackson Square, with people reporting strange objects zigzagging across our view of the moon," shared Marianne Gomez, who was having coffee nearby when she caught site of it herself around 12:30 AM local time on Wednesday morning. "It just looked surreal."


Since then at least five separate accounts have been reported to police and other government agencies by perplexed citizens hailing from various parts of the city, with more witnesses expected as rumors spread. Eyewitness reports mention objects that appear larger when viewed directly ahead but seem smaller from a distance – an aspect some are attributing to possible optical illusions while others suggest advanced technology being involved due to observed consistent behavior and light patterns among different eyewitness accounts across the city, ranging in age as young as 8-years old up till middle-aged adults.


The United States Space Command has issued a statement expressing their interest in understanding these sightings better: "We appreciate all citizens' efforts to report such phenomena and are keen on working with local law enforcement agencies for thorough investigations," said Majestic General of the US Space Command based at Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado.


Efforts from both governmental and private sectors are underway in New Orleans as they attempt to make sense of these anomalous sightings that have left residents rattled by a phenomenon most would expect only found on science fiction screens rather than their own reality here at home.
