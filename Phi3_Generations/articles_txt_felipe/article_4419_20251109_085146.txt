A luxury hotel in downtth Townsville was evacuated on Tuesday night due to suspected structural issues with its lobby ceiling which collapsed at around 10pm local time, reports CNN and DailyMail. The grandiose building known for its opulent design had already been under observation since early Monday when minor cracks were first detected during a routine inspection by the town's engineering firm.

Authorities swiftly intervened to ensure guest safety following sightings of creaking sounds near popular amenities like pools and restaurants on Tuesday night, prompting immediate evacuation procedures as backup generators kicked in after power outages caused panic among guests awaiting clearance from the property's management.

"I was sitting by my poolside when I heard this loud noise that sounded like glass breaking; it scared me straight into getting up to see what happened outside," said Mandy Thompson, a patron who stayed at The Regency Retreat for three nights during her recent vacation here with family members. "It looked as if some parts of the ceiling came crashing down from above but luckily nobody was injured."

While no casualties were reported immediately after Tuesday's incident, concerns remain about potential fallout or secondary hazards within various sections of The Regency Retreat which houses approximately 300 guests at any given time. This situation is not only impacting the local economy due to disruptions in tourist activities but also poses a threat on guest safety and comfort for those staying ahead, raising questions about whether all bookings should be refunded or canceled outrightly by hotel management officials themselves - something that still needs clarification.

The town's mayor has issued an urgent statement addressing the concern over structural damages to properties housing public and private parties alike: "It is my sincere hope we all realize how fragile our buildings can be, particularly in times of unexpected calamities such as this one," Mayor David Reynolds stressed. He further explained that engineers from a reputable firm are dispatched on-site for inspection and to assess the situation while urging residents not to panic or make rash decisions regarding their accommodations during transitional periods like these: "We understand how disconcerting this may be, but we also need everyone's patience as professionals work diligently towards fixing what went wrong," Mayor Reynolds concluded.

In the meantime, an engineer who was onsite commented that further investigation is still needed to identify and address underlying issues before any repairs commence: "We are currently examining every inch of this building for potential risk factors associated with structural integrity or material decay which may have contributed toward Tuesday evening's incident," said Engineer Sarah Parker, who worked onsite alongside a team dispatched by Townsville Engineering Authority.

With guests being allowed to return inside starting from mid-evening hours and no immediate injuries reported as of 7pm Wednesday local time after an assessment found safety measures in place for temporary repairs until more comprehensive renovations are undertaken, The Regency Retreat management is taking steps forward: "We apologize sincerely to our guests who were inconvenienced by this unfortunate event and promise that necessary corrective actions will be implemented swiftly," General Manager of the hotel John Hastings stated. He also mentioned their plan for offering complimentary
