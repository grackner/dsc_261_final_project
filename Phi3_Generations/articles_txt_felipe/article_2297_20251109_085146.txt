A recent study on climate impact has revealed that Greenland's ice sheet is melting at an unprecedent rate due to rising global temperatures — a phenomenon widely linked with human activity. Researchers from the University of Copenhagen published their findings in Nature Climate Change last Thursday, indicating rapid changes within just over two decades that have previously been observed only once before during Earth's history. The study focused on analyzing ice core samples and satellite imagery data collected across Greenland starting from 1995 to identify the patterns of meltwater runoff into the ocean — a critical factor contributing to rising sea levels worldwide, according to lead researcher Dr. Anne-Sophie Huson.

"Our findings are extremely concerning as they show that not only is Greenland's ice melting faster than ever before; but it also appears we have been underestimating its contribution towards global sea level rise," said Huson, a glaciologist with the university’s Centre for Geocomputation and Analysis. The study estimates an alarming increase of about 21 gigatons per year in runoff from Greenland's ice sheet since the mid-90s — roughly equivalent to doubling New York City's annual water consumption, according to Huson.

The rapid melting is a direct consequence of warming temperatures across parts of northern Europe and North America where glaciers are found due in large part to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. The research team used advanced computer modeling techniques alongside their data analysis methods to provide accurate projections for the future of Greenland's ice sheet — which could play a significant role if trends continue unchecked, as Huson cautions:

"If current melting rates persist and increase further with continued global warming, our research predicts that in less than 20 years’ time most parts of southern Greenland will be free from ice." The implications are far-reaching — not only does the meltwater contribute directly to sea level rise but also threatens local ecosystems as it changes fresh water dynamics.

The findings, coming just a week before world leaders gather in Scotland for crucial COP26 climate summit talks next month (November 30 - December 12), underscore the urgent need to address human-induced greenhouse gas emissions that contribute towards global warming. The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is expected to release its own latest report shortly, which will likely echo Huson’s findings about climate change impacting Greenland and other ice sheets around the world more rapidly than anticipated in earlier models based primarily on natural forces like solar radiation.

Environmental experts are calling for immediate action as well — "We need to seriously reconsider our approach towards mitigating global warming," said Dr. Jane Smith, an environmental scientist at Harvard University who is not affiliated with the study but has been working in climate change research independently of Huson's team:

"This latest finding just adds more proof that humans are directly responsible for causing rapid ice melting and sea level rise — something we should all take seriously to avoid irreversible consequences." The COP26 summit is expected bring together global leaders representing almost 100 nations, including the United States under President Joe Biden's administration. However critics argue that time has not been wasted already with insufficient policy action and implementation on climate change mit
