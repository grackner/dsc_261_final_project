Amidst a booming real estate market in San Francisco, an iconic Art Deco skyscraper constructed during the Great Depression is set to undergo major renovations aimed at preserving its historical essence while integrating modern amenities and safety features. Plans are reportedly approved for the 1930s-era building, located on Market Street in downtner San Francisco, scheduled to commence work starting next month with an estimated completion date of two years later.

The Art Deco masterpiece is celebrated as one of few surviving examples from its era that still adorn cityscapes today – and despite significant wear over the decades since it was first constructed in 1932, local heritage groups are keen to see it remain standing for generations. The architectural firm entrusted with this delicate task claims they will preserve original elements such as geometric motifs on walls while upgrading electrical systems and installing accessibility features like elevators catered towards differently-abled individuals.

"Preserving the character of our city’s history is important to us," said architectural historian Dr. Margaret Lee, who specializes in San Francisco's Art Deco style buildings. "We want this building not just as a testament but also functional for today." 

The project has received mixed reactions from locals and historians alike – some appreciate the effort to maintain historical accuracy while others hope modifications will be minimal due concern over gentrification pushing out long-term residents in favor of upscale developments. Residents have been invited by organizers for public feedback on aspects they wish retained versus modernized, as detailed discussions continue at city council meetings every Thursday evening through August 20th next year – all before the renovation commences work first week September third month December following-year end January fifth start.
