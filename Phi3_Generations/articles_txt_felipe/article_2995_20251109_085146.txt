At a local pizzeria in Brooklyn's Williamsburg neighborhood last Thursday evening, patrons enjoyed their meals until an unexpected guest arrived - live lobsters fresh from the ocean! The unusual sight came about during New York Fresh Seafood Day held at Joe & Patty’s Pizza on August 15th.

Local resident and avid seafood enthusiast, Michael Thompson was spotted carrying a cooler filled with various species of crustaceans to the pizzeria's outdoor tables for an open-air dining experience that had been gaining popularity over recent months amongst locals looking to enjoy some sunshine. 

"I always loved seafood, and I thought it would be a great way to introduce folks in Williamsburg to the taste of fresh lobsters," Thompson explained as he set down his cooler with an array of crab legs on one table. "It was meant to surprise them."

Thompson's decision garnered mixed reactions from diners who had come expecting typical New York-style pizza and were instead faced with the choice between a steaming plate of lobster or their original orders. Several customers expressed astonishment at first, but many soon joined in on laughter as they shared photos via social media platforms after tasting Thompson's imprompt extraneous culinary experimentation.

"I told my daughter I wanted pizza tonight and she said 'What? You want lobster?' We decided to give it a shot - we all laughed about this for days," joked long-time Williamsburg resident, Sarah Bennett who was among the first few customers at Joe & Patty’s Pizza.

According to Chef Tony Rodriguez of the pizzeria owner Danny Meyer's restaurant group, Thompson asked if they could feature his fresh lobsters in a dish he planned to prepare on-site with their chefs that evening: “We were flattered by Michael’s idea. It was quite unexpected but we loved it!”

While some patrons decided against changing up the menu and stuck to pizza, those who tried Thompson's creation found a new appreciation for New York lobsters after enjoying them alongside their regular orders: "It definitely changed my perspective on seafood. I thought this could be something special we do once in a while," noted Danielle Kimura.

The next-door diner, Joe’s Deli and Grill owner George Peterson remarked that such unique ideas only add to the diverse culinary experiences Williamsburg has become known for: "People have always loved coming here because of our authentic atmosphere – Michael's idea brought even more excitement into this little neighborhood gem. It made everyone feel at home."

Moving forward, local foodies anticipate that similar events like Thompson’s initiative may continue to evolve and become a recurring part of the community's social life with new culinary experiments popping up each season. In fact, discussions are already underway among other restaurant owners interested in bringing their signature dishes into more public venues for communal enjoyment or trying out innovative fusion cuisine inspired by such events – as Thompson himself puts it: "It’s all about sharing the love of food and discovering new favorites together."

For now, however, Michael's lobster experiment remains a once-in-a-lifetime experience for many in Williamsburg.
