Biden's Lead Grows in New CNN Poll Before Midterms; Democrats Seek to Rally Voters Amid Stable Republican Numbers - November 20, 2decade ago-13 hours ago In the latest CNN poll conducted ahead of this weekend’s midterm elections, President Joe Biden maintains a lead over his opponents. As voters head to polls across America on Tuesday (November 8), new data from CNN suggests Democrats are hoping their strategy will rally enough support among the electorate in swing states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin after months of political uncertainty following the contentious presidential election last year.

The latest poll reveals that President Biden holds a slight but steady advantage over Republicans, with 49% saying they'll vote for him compared to Donald Trump’s support at 43%. While there are indications from previous elections and exit polls suggesting the midterms could potentially see Democrats lose seats in Congress due to voter fatigue or discontent amongst some demographic groups, current numbers show no such significant movement yet.

"Democratic supporters seem more energized than we anticipated last year," says senior pollster Dr. Jane Thompson of the University of Washington’s Political Science department in an interview with CNN reporter Mark Johnson at 9am ET today, a day before voting is scheduled to take place nationwide between noon and eight pm on November 8th across several states including Pennsylvania (PA), Wisconsin (WI), Michigan (MI), Arizona (AZ) among others.

Thompson cites the recent executive order from President Biden aimed at reducing climate change as one of key factors mobilizing voters, alongside a strong stance on social issues and economic policies that appear promising for Democratic candidates in several battleground states where turnout is expected to be high because both parties see it being tightly contested.

In light of these findings, party officials have rallied their forces together at campaign headquarters across key districts leading up towards Election Day (Tuesday). There are plans for numerous get-out-the-vote initiatives in several critical swing states targeting high school and college students as well older adults who may face barriers getting to the polls due to health or transportation issues according to a White House spokesperson.

"We understand these voters might not feel connected enough with politics; however, this poll has inspired confidence among many that every vote does matter," says Senator Elizabeth Walton from Wisconsin who participated in one such event at UW-Madison last night where thousands gathered on campus demanding change while celebrating democratic values.

The race for Congress appears more competitive than ever with both parties aiming to secure seats through various means including campaign advertising, fundraising efforts and voter outreach initiatives targeted at minorities as well Latino communities have shown increased participation rates in recent years according experts like Dr Robert Lewis from NYU's School of Public Policy.

"Democrats are doing an excellent job engaging these groups who historically tend to lean Republican," says the expert, noting that Democrats need around 260 electoral votes nationwide including pick-ups in states such as Arizona and Pennsylvania along with holding onto crucial seats they currently possess like Michigan.
