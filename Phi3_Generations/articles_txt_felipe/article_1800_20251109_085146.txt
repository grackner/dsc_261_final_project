A powerful storm system battered New Orleans on Thursday night, causing widespinistery damages and prompting urgent warnings from local officials to take shelter immediately. The intense downpour of rain led to flooding in multiple neighborhoods around the city as wind gusts reached up to 60 mph (97 km/h). Mayor LaToya Cantrell expressed her concerns about potential flash flooding, urging residents not to ignore evacuation orders and advising them on where to find temporary shelters.

The storm system came through with little warning as it tracked across the Gulf of Mexico before making landfall around 6 p.m., according to data from the National Weather Service (NWS). Thunderstorms within the larger weather front dumped a total of approximately six inches (15 cm) of rain in just three hours, overwhelming drainage systems that struggled against rising water levels on already flooded streets.

"The situation is dire and requires immediate action," said Mayor Cantrell during her evening press conference at the Emergency Operations Center located downtown New Orleans. "Residents are being asked to evacuate if they haven't done so already, as we don't want anyone caught in this dangerous weather."

Several inches of rainwater surged onto roadways and into homes throughout historically low-lying areas like the Lower Ninth Ward and Gentilly. At one point on St. Bernard Avenue near Industrial Canal around 9 p.m., water rose as high as four feet inside a house, forcing residents to climb out windows while some sought refuge in rooftops or elevated parts of their homes for safety, said witness Linda Gauthier-LeCompt.

"I never thought I'd see my street look like this," she told CNN affiliate WDSU live from her front porch as the water lapped at the steps leading to and beyond them — submerging cars that were already sitting high in a cul de sac off of Gentilly Boulevard. "It came so fast, it was terrifying."

Gauthier-LeCompt's husband stayed home during their mandatory evacuation because he needed his oxygen tank full and charged to work remotely — both conditions were difficult as power outages became widespread by nightfall. Despite the hardship, however, Gauthier-LeCompt emphasized how grateful they are for emergency responders who arrived quickly on their doorstep when water started entering her house at around 5:30 p.m.

"When you see people running to your home with buckets full of dirty brown water...it's disheartening," she said, adding that a neighbor had also brought some bottled drinkable water for them all before they were able to find shelter at the local high school turned into an emergency response hub.

Storm systems like this one are becoming more common in recent years due to climate change and sea level rise — both linked directly back to human activity, said climatologist Dr. Rebecca Methven with Tulane University's Center for Coastal Studies earlier today via Zoom interview after the storm passed through New Orleans but prior sunset along Lake Ponchartrain in its path thereof as it pushed northeastward toward Mobile Bay and then eventually northwest back out to sea again, though this time less forcefully since weaker cold air has replaced warm tropical moisture on our northern
