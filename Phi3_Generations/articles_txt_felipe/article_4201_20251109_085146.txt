In an unprecedented health alert issued this morning by local authorities in Milltown, a community of roughly 50,00 extraterrestrial beings known as "Flerp," officials reported that nearly one-third have contracted the mysterious 'Zyphloten Disease.' With no apparent cure or immediate treatment available, public health experts are racing to understand this newfound interspecies illness.

Dr. Alia Bender, a leading epidemiologist at Milltown University's Intergalactic Studies Department has been appointed the head of an emergency task force charged with studying and mitigating the effects of Zyphloten Disease among Flerps. "The rapid spread within this population is highly unusual," Bender explains, stressing that human interference could be accelerating transmission rates amongst the local alien species who share their home world on Planet Xelion 3B-7A5X.

Reports from witnesses suggest an initial outbreak of symptoms among Flerps at a popular communal dining hall, where they frequently gather for meals consisting primarily of purple fungus and crispy root vegetables indigenous to their planet's soil composition - staples in the alien diet. Residents recall observing affected individuals appearing lethargic or unable to participate fully at communal events, with some exhibiting a peculiar loss of balance among themselves after consuming these particular dishes over several weeks prior to public knowledge about Zyphloten Disease reaching widespread awareness levels.

Accordingly, human authorities have temporarily halted consumption and importation from Milltown's bustling extraterrestrial marketplace while the Centers for Alien Health Research (CAHR) establishes protocols to safeguard not only Flerps but also humans who frequently interact with them on Planet Xelion. "These measures are essential as we seek ways of preventing cross-species transmission," states Mayor Gideon T'larin, emphasizing the need for continued vigilance and interstellar cooperation between Earthly governments and their extraterrestrial counterparts while researchers continue to unravel how Zyphloten Disease emerged among Flerps.

Meanwhile on Xelion 3B-7A5X, the local Council of Elders are convening tonight at Moonbase Alpha for what is being called an Emergency Session - a rare event given their typically laissez-faire approach towards foreign entities living in harmony with them. In this unique moment however, they appear resolute about protecting all life forms on Xelion 3B and are expected to announce measures aimed at curbing the disease's spread within Flerp communities without disrupting intergalactic relations too severely while human scientists work diligbotnly towards finding a solution.

"We must remember that we share this planet with countless other beings," counters Chief Councilor Liraan P’khrin, "The survival of one does not mean the demise of another." In response to Earth's swift actions in suspending Flerp food imports temporarily and halting interspecies activities at public gathering points as a precautionary measure against Zyphloten Disease transmission: P’khrin promises that he will personally oversee the welfare of his people, who make up about 2%
