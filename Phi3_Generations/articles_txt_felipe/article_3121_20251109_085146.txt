A massive power outage has struck parts of Tamil Nadu in southern India on March 15th, affecting over a million homes and businesses as temperatures soared above 40°C (104°F). The Electricity Department confirmed that around two-thirds of the state's electric grid was down due to severe technical failures.

The blackout began early in the morning when an issue with a transformer cascaded into systemwide problems, as reported by local news outlets like ANI and Sify Entertainment News. Many residents expressed their concern over social media platforms while sharing tips on coping during this heatwave-induced crisis, especially for vulnerable populations such as senior citizens living alone or families with young children residing in areas hit the hardest.

"We had been monitoring a possible problem at one of our substations near Chennai since early yesterday morning," said an official from Tamil Nadu Electricity Department (TNEB). "The malfunctioning transformer caused issues throughout our network." According to weather reports, temperatures exceeded 42°C in several regions across the state.

In a statement released shortly afterward, Chief Minister M K Stalin reassured residents that teams of engineers were working tirelessly around-the-clock trying their best to restore power as quickly and safely as possible while adhering strictly to protocols for repair work amidst extreme heat conditions: "We understand the severity of this crisis on our people, especially senior citizens. Our team is doing everything in its capacity without any compromise," he added after addressing a press conference at his residence yesterday afternoon with local MLAs and top officials from TNEB present.

Experts warn that such prolonged outages could lead to significant health issues if precautions are not taken by affected individuals, particularly the elderly who might struggle with daily activities like cooking or staying hydrated without electric fans during hot days at this time of year when temperatures usually dip into single digits. In a recent interview with local journalist Ravi Krishnan published in Times Now Hindi News on March 16th, Dr Anupama Mudaliyar, an expert from Tamil Nadu's Department of Public Health and Prevention Services cautioned: "We must remember that our most vulnerable citizens will need additional support during these hot days as they can easily fall sick due to heat-induced dehydration or respiratory problems."

TNEB has set up temporary relief camps at various locations across the state, providing cool water and fans for people in areas still experiencing blackouts. As of this morning (March 17th), around half a million households were without power due to ongoing repairs while engineers continue working as temperatures remain above average levels nationwide today with forecasts expecting them to stay elevated through next weekend - marking the hottest March day in over two decades.

Throughout Tamil Nadu's rich history, it has experienced several power outages due mainly to technical issues that cause transformers or other components of its age-old electric grid system to fail regularly. However, most blackouts have always been short-lived with repairs completed within hours rather than days - as this unprecedented situation is demonstrating currently across parts of the southern state today where temperatures reached above 45°C (113°F).
