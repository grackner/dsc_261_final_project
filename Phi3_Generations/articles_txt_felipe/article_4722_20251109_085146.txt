A local fitness center in downtthorpe has been forced to temporarily shut down due to a mysterious illness that struck multiple members last weekend. The health department is currently investigating the cause behind these unexplained symptoms, which include persistent coughing and fatigue among others.

The CrossFit Wellness Center in Thorpe has been providing fitness services for over 10 years without any major incidents like this ever occurring before now. The manager of the center expressed her concern about how such a situation came to be, saying "It's unheard of; we pride ourselves on maintaining strict hygiene and safety protocols."

Customers first started reporting symptoms after attending their weekly Thursday class held at CrossFit Wellness. These individuals range in age from 20-45, making them all young parents or professionals trying to keep fit despite a busy schedule. "I've never experienced anything like it before," said one customer who started coughing heavily during the workout session on March 19th - three days ago exactly.

The symptoms seem non-specific and point towards an airborne illness, according to Dr. Lisa Reynolds of Thorpe Community Hospital's infectious disease department who was asked for her professional opinion by local health reporters: "Airbourne transmission seems the most probable cause as we have yet seen no evidence pointing otherwise."

Health officials are now conducting environmental testing in CrossFit Wellness and its surrounding areas while they await results of clinical examinations conducted on affected individuals. They hope these tests will shed light on what exactly transpired here during their workout sessions, but until then all members must refrain from using the facilities for fitness routines as a safety precaution.

The management at CrossFit Wellness is cooperating fully with health officials and has taken immediate steps such as deep cleaning of premises regularly while also implementing stringent hygiene protocols, including mandatory mask-wearing indoors until further notice. 

"We deeply regret the situation here but are committed to ensuring our members' safety above all else," said CrossFit Wellness manager Jill Thompson during a press conference on March 20th where she provided updates about measures taken and plans for reopening once health officials give them clearance. "As soon as we receive permission from the local authorities, which can take up to two weeks or more depending upon testing results & follow-ups with public health services; then only will we resume providing fitness routines here."

Residents in Thorpe are understandably worried and have been advised by medical professionals that while exercise is important for overall wellbeing, one must take extra precautions when gyms reopen post lockdown. "Don't underestimate the power of germ-infested equipment or shared air spaces", said Dr. Mark Evans from Thorpe Community Hospital who has been advising locals on health & safety measures during this unprecedented time. 

In summary, while CrossFit Wellness Center in downtown Thorpe remains closed pending further testing by local authorities and public health officials; it is hoped that the matter will be resolved swiftly so fitness enthusiasts can once again enjoy their workout routines without fear or concern for unexplained symptoms.
