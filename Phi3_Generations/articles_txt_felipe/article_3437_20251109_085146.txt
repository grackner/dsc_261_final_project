In a striking display of military capability this weekend in Nigeria's capital city Abuja, officials confirmed that for over four hours on Friday night, an unprecedent number of troops engaged hostile armed groups causing widespread violence and displacement within the nation. This confrontation unfolded during what was supposed to be a peacekeeping mission aimed at quelling inter-tribal conflicts in northeastern Nigeria's volatile region.

"The situation is dire; we need immediate international assistance," stated Brigadier General Oluwatoyin Akinbajo, the head of military operations command deployed to intervene during this crisis spurred by escalating ethnic tensions between three major tribes – Hausa-Fulani, Yoruba, and Igbo.

This unfortunate event took place in Nigeria's capital Abuja on Friday night where hundreds of troops were initially tasked with maintaining peace within the conflict zones spread out across various villages such as Gulmari, Gwagdemiye I and II; Yankpa-Sule/Abaa among others. However, their efforts quickly turned into a challenge after they encountered heavy resistance from local armed militias loyal to competing ethnic factions resulting in an escalation of violence with numerous casualties reported on both sides including civilians caught amidst the crossfire - marking this confrontation as one of the most severe clashes since Nigeria's independence.

A witness, who wished not be named for fear of reprisals from either side spoke out saying "we have seen more bloodshed than ever before in our village with innocent men children women and elders all being caught between two sides". It is estimated that about 50 people were killed while up to a thousand others remain missing as hostilities continue unabated since the confrontation ended early Sunday.

The Nigerian military said they received intelligence reports of an impending attack by armed groups which led them into action but it seems their preparations for this operation did not take account of ethnic and tribal animosities brewing in these communities leading to such devastating results as seen today with many more violent clashes anticipated if efforts are not made towards peace talks soon.

The African Union High Representative Mohamed Soltan expressed concern over the situation, "It is alarming that despite decades of independence from colonial rule; Nigeria now finds itself trapped in an ethnic quagmire with no end to these disputes seen anytime soon". He called upon all parties involved including traditional leaders and religious figures who still have significant influence among local populations for assistance towards ending this crisis through dialogue, adding that "our organization stands ready to facilitate peace talks between the conflicting groups in order achieve lasting reconciliation."

In response various Nigerian government officials made statements promising swift actions while others pointed fingers at alleged external interference as being responsible for fanning existing tensions. This includes claims from some politicians that ethnic militias have been receiving support and funding from foreign countries seeking influence in the oil-rich region with President Buhari vowing a "zero tolerance" approach towards any form of armed rebellion within his borders even if it means deploying troops nationwide.

The ongoing crisis comes amidst Nigeria's struggles to contain jihadist insurgents like Boko Haram and ISIS West Africa who have been fighting for control over parts of
