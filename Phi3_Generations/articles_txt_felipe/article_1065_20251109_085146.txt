Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu arrived in Gaza yesterday for talks with Palestinian officials amid escalating tensions across the region following US President Joe Biden's trip to Israel and the West Bank last weekend, CNN reported. The development comes as Turkey seeks ways to maintain influence while managing its relationship with both Arab nations and Israeli-controlled Gaza Strip since strains worsened under former president Recep Tayyip Erdogan. "Our primary concern is the future of our two peoples," Cavusoglu said during his first official trip outside Turkey in 15 years, stressing that dialogue was crucial to address long-standing issues and find solutions for both parties' interests as he flew from Istanbul via Egypt. In Israel last weekend, Biden met with Netanyahu at a time when the Israeli leader has sought stronger economic ties amid rising anti-Semitism fears globally. 


Observers are watching closely to see if Cavusoglu's trip could help deescalate regional conflicts and pave the way for peace initiatives in Jerusalem, which have been on hold since April when Hamas took control of Gaza Strip after an Islamic militant group seized power. "The world needs more diplomacy right now," said a Middle East expert quoted by Reuters as saying that Cavusoglu's talks may give Turkey the opportunity to bridge gaps between Israel and Palestine, two nations at odds over land claims for decades. Prioritizing regional stability is vital given upcoming sensitive events like Israeli annexation of parts of occupied West Bank territory slated for next month, along with a looming UAE-Israel peace agreement expected to reshape political alliances in the Arab world further south.


"We have no option but dialogue," said Hamas spokesman Issam Sabbagh during an interview yesterday as he expressed hope that Cavusoglu's visit might lead to progress despite historical distrust between Palestin0, Israel, and Turkey—a NATO ally with a strong military footprint in the region.


During his time in Cairo overnight before heading onwards for Gaza yesterday evening around 8 p.m., Cavusoglu held talks with President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who reported no new developments since last week's escalation but stressed that both countries stood firmly together despite differences in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and Turkey’s support for Palestine. The Foreign Minister also spoke to Egyptian officials about regional stability issues including Iran’s influence as well as broader security concerns after recent terror attacks across neighboring nations. 


Tensions rose following comments made by U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan last weekend, where he emphasized Israel's right to exist and criticized Hamas for violence in Gaza Strip — actions that led some Palestinians in the region to express anger towards Washington, with one protester telling Al-Jazeera: "We feel betrayed by Joe Biden." Cavusoglu’s trip is part of Turkey's broader efforts at regional influence amidst global power shifts and a strategic partnership with Israel that has been strained in recent years over issues like the Gaza blockade.
