In a groundbreaking development in plant science research, scientists from Stanford University announced on Tuesday that they have created what can be considered as a 'living organism' made entirely of plants and fungi without any animal cells or tissues. This revolutionary discovery was showcased at the International Botanical Congress held this weekend in Vienna, Austria, where researchers unveiled their creation during an afternoon session on Saturday after three years of intensive work.

The so-called 'Plantoid' is a gelatinous structure that mimics animal motions through hydraulic pressure while relying solely on photosynthesis and biodegradation for sustenance, eliminating the need to consume other organisms altogether. The lead researcher of this study, Dr. Emily Wong from Stanford's Plant Biology Department, explained in a statement that their team has successfully created an artificial life form capable of growth, reproduction, and response mechanisms all autonomously produced by plant cells alone.

"Our creation represents not just the merging of two kingdoms - plants and fungi – but also opens up new possibilities for developing sustainable alternatives to current biological systems," Dr. Wong said at the congress on Saturday afternoon after presenting her team's research findings based in detail throughout Friday night sessions that included live demonstrations, data analysis results, experiments with various plant species used in crafting these organisms and their potential applications across multiple industries ranging from agriculture to medicine.

During the conference presentation held on Saturday afternoon by Dr. Wong alongside her team members; assistant researcher Liam Johnson shared his thoughts about what this discovery means for humanity's understanding of life itself: "We are exploring boundaries we never thought possible, but as plant biologists and ecologists working with these organisms understandably have mixed feelings."

Dr. Wong went on to add that their team has been conducting rigorous tests since early 2021 when they first stumbled upon a viable way of cultivating non-animal bio-materials using primarily plant cells in conjunction with fungi under specific environmental conditions, which led them towards this unconventional approach to studying life.

Despite the initial challenges and skepticism faced by researchers when they began working on developing such an organism as early as late 2021; experts like renowned bioethicist Dr. Maria Rodriguez expressed her concerns about unforeseen consequences of creating artificial life forms that resemble living creatures, adding to the controversies surrounding this groundbreaking research effort: "While I commend such forward-thinking work being done by scientists; we must also take into consideration potential ecological impacts these organisms may have if released outside controlled environments."

The Stanford team's next steps involve seeking approval from various scientific bodies for continued funding to further their research, as well as conducting more in-depth analysis of the effects this artificial life form could potentially pose on natural ecosystems. They are also planning trials using different plant species and examining potential applications across industries such as agriculture where self-sufficient living organisms may provide a solution to food shortages or medicinal plants that can be cultured instead of harvested from the wild, reducing environmental impact on natural habitats.

The International Botanical Congress concludes today with many questions still open about how these 'Plantoid's', if approved
