Greek island tourists trapped by hurricane face rescue as storm intensifies | CNN Business and World News

The fierce wrath of nature is set to strike again in the form of Hurricane Elise, which has already claimed two lives off the coasts near Mykonos. The Greek government issued a warning last night that all vacationers must evacuate immediately as their safety became increasingly compromised amidst escalating weather conditions expected overnight into today.

Evacuees are making for Athens, with thousands of stranded tourists hoping to be rescued within 48 hours from the last reported sighting at midnight near Kalavrti Beach in Mykonos. Weather reports predict a worsening storm as Hurricane Elise escalates into Category 3 by early tomorrow morning, with expected wind speeds reaching up to 120 miles per hour and torrential rainfall causing significant flooding throughout the island's narrow streets.

Mykonos Mayor Demetrios Panayiotou stated at a press conference this evening that it is "critical for everyone’ endangered by Elise" in order to find safe shelter away from its dangerous path as soon as possible: 

"Everyone should immediately seek higher ground and await further instructions. We are doing everything within our power, but there's no way we can control what mother nature throws at us," said Mayor Panayiotou with a concerned tone in his voice.

The National Meteorological Service reports that the storm center will be near Kalavrti Beach later tonight and is projected to move west-northwest, making landfall along mainland Greece's northern Aegean coast by midnight tomorrow night before heading towards Crete within 48 hours. They predict heavy rainfall across much of the Peloponnese peninsula with possible flooding in low-lying areas where tourists are typically located:

"The most concerning issue is that these storms come without warning, and our evacuation plans rely heavily on accurate weather forecasting," explains Dr. Ioanna Stamatioua meteorologist for the Greek Meteorological Service who has closely monitored Elise's development over several days now approaching Category 3 strength:

"We urge all holiday-makers not to risk their lives trying to evacuate on their own; please trust our rescue services and seek help immediately if stranded." The Greek Red Cross is preparing emergency supplies, including food, water, blankets, as well medical kits for those in need of immediate assistance upon arrival at designated shelters. They urge anyone who cannot evacuate to shelter themselves inside a building or structure until the storm passes and offer guidance on how best navigate through flooded areas with their expertise:

"We're doing everything possible, but no one should take chances under these conditions," says Dimitris Georgoulys president of Hellenic Red Cross in Mykonos who has been coordinating relief efforts since the storm first made landfall on Monday morning. "Our volunteers are working tirelessly to assist those stranded and provide aid where needed most, but we need everyone's help staying safe until then."

Hundreds of vacation-goers have arrived safely at designated evacuation centers across mainland Greece overnight with many more expected throughout today as weather conditions continue worsen. Tourism operators on Mykonos are encourag
