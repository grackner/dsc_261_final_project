A major refugee processing center in Greece has been shut down following a surge of arrivals from Afghanistan overwhelming staff and facilities at Moria Camp on Lesbos Island earlier this week. As the UNHCR's Regional Emergency Officer for Europe, John Doe stated: "The situation is dire; there are now more refugees than we have resources to manage."

Moria Camp in Greece has been a key point of entry into the European Union since it was established as an open-border zone following the fall of communism. However, after years of dwindling arrivals from war-torn regions like Syria and Iraq, refugee numbers began to rise again due to unrest brewing in Afghanistan over recent months. 

In response to this resurgence, Germany has promised an additional €30 million for the provision of safe shelters across Greece as they reevaluate their approach towards managing Europe's ongoing refugee crisis - which began after World War II and continues today in many parts of Africa and Asia. 

The closure at Moria comes amid mounting criticism from NGO groups, who say the camp was not prepared for such an influx despite a growing number of arrivals since October last year alone. The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) reported that nearly 30,00 extraditions occurred in September and over 45,000 people passed through Lesbos via Greek ports between January-August this year - an increase from the same period in 2019.

UNHCR's Regional Emergency Officer for Europe says that it is not just a Greece problem as countries across Europe are grappling with their own refugee crises, although nations like Hungary and Poland have become hotspots of concern due to rising nationalism against migrants: "The situation in Europe continues to worsen."

In the face of these challenges, experts urge international cooperation between countries as they deal not only with humanitarian issues but also security concerns. As former EU Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid Jane Smith noted earlier this year at a conference: "It's time to come together and tackle this crisis head-on."

With no immediate solution in sight, refugees continue their journey throughout Europe while aid organizations struggle to meet growing demands on the ground. The European Parliament is expected to discuss new policies for handling asylum seekers next month amid escalating reports of abuse within camps across Greece and Italy - a problem that experts say only exacerbates an already dire situation: "We need better regulations, stronger leadership at all levels."

Greece's Minister of Migration Notis Marias told reporters earlier today after touring the camp with local authorities on Lesbos Island about progress being made. Despite acknowledging that conditions remain tough for refugees and aid workers alike he emphasised a need to work together: "It will take all nations, organizations working in solidarity here at home."

As hundreds of thousands continue their journeys throughout Europe seeking asylum or safety from war-ravaged countries like Syria - with more than 6.5 million people displaced within Africa alone and millions still stuck in camps worldwide the need for global solutions remains urgent: "We must come together to find long term, humane ways of dealing with these crises."
