Amidst a tumultuous global financial landscape, major US and European stock markets closed lower yesterday as investors brace for an inflation-driven headwind in the upcoming months. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed over two percent to end at close of trading with significant losses across multiple sectors including technology, finance, and energy while indices like FTSE 100 saw a similar trend after closing down approximately one percent on Tuesday amidst the pre-market uncertainty.

The shakeout started as early market optimism began to wane in anticipation of potentially stiffening Federal Reserve interest rates aimed at curbing rising inflation, which is expected to spike another percentage point higher by year's end according to forecasts from economists and financial analysts.
