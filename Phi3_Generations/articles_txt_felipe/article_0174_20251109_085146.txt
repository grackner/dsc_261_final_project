As travel continues to bounce back from its downturn due to COVID-19 restrictions, recent data indicates a surge in demand for domestic and short haul international trips within the United States. This renewed appetite has put pressure on hotel occupancy rates across various price points with luxury accommodations experiencing significant increases as well.

In cities like New York City, Los Angeles, Miami Beach, Aspen, Las Vegas, San Francisco Bay Area and Seattle - which have been hit hard by the pandemic in terms of their tourism-reliant economies - hotels are reporting full bookings for both leisure and business travelers. According to STR's latest data from July 15th through August 7th, occupancy levels exceeded pre-pandemic averages across these cities by an average margin of nearly nine percent compared to last year at the same timeframe on dates ranging between two days after Memorial Day until Labor Day weekend.

"Our guests are coming back in full force this summer and they seem more willing than ever before when it comes to spending," says Michael Smith, Executive Vice President of Operations for New York City-based Premier Inn & Suites franchise chain The Staybridge Lofts at the Waldorf Astoria.

Sandra Gonzalez is a travel expert from San Diego who echoes this sentiment as she explains that "people are feeling more confident about their plans after being vaccinated." She further notes how some travellers have taken longer trips due to pent-up demand, opting for destinations like the Canadian Rockies or Hawaii over traditional beach vacation spots.

The trend is not just limited to urban areas as resorts in popular domestic ski towns such as Aspen are reporting similar surges with occupancy rates reaching nearly 102 percent last week during Christmas holiday season break-up which typically sees very low booking levels for this time of year according to Tim Martinson, General Manager at the Pandora's Box Resort and Spa in Colorado.

According to data from STR - one of several global market intelligence firms that provide statistics on hotel performance worldwide – demand is also up significantly across Europe with occupancy levels increasing by an average margin of around six percent since Memorial Day weekend compared to the same timeframe last year and exceeding pre-pandemic 2019 averages in most markets except for London, Paris and Barcelona.

Hoteliers say that guests are booking longer stays with extended amenities such as pools or gyms playing an essential role in decision making process alongside free shuttle services to local attractions - something which hotel chains have adapted quickly due increased demand after lockdown restrictions were eased by governments across the world.

In response, many hotels are re-evaluating their offerings and pricing strategies while others such as luxury brand Ritz Carlton Resorts & Spa announced plans last week to open additional properties in popular destinations like Miami Beach - taking advantage of record high demand for upscale accommodation options during peak travel season.

Accordingly, industry experts recommend that travellers planning ahead should start booking as soon as possible due potential higher rates and limited availability with some hotels raising prices by up to 15 percent over previous seasons' averages since they are operating at near-full capacity throughout popular destinations around the globe during summer months.

As a result of this trend, many experts see
