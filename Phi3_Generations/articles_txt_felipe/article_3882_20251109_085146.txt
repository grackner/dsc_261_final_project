On Saturday night in Arizona's Cardinals Stadium at Glendale, local businessman and lifelran Jim Smith watched on as his favorite team took a tough loss to the Los Angeles Rams with scores of 14-30 by halftime. The win for LA was their fourth straight season under head coach Sean McVay’s leadership after taking over in 2017, while Cardinals have struggled this year without quarterback Kyler Murray and aim to make it three games they've lost since he joined the team last month (MLB).

Smith was disappointed but not surprised by his hometown team's performance on Saturday night. "I grew up cheering for our Cardinals, so watching them lose is always tough," said Smith from Section 127A of the stadium where he has season tickets since moving back to Arizona after college in California ten years ago.

The Rams had not won a game at home under McVay's watch until this defeat against Jimenez City, sparking rumors about possible coaching changes if they can’t snap their losing streak next Sunday as the team heads into another away matchup on December 2nd in Atlanta. The Cardinals are expected to take back momentum for a win with Kyler Murray returning from his mid-season knee injury and head coach Klint Kubiak is confident he has found success since taking over, despite losing two out of three games this season so far; the team will look forward to regaining their form when they host divisional rival LA at home on December 10th.

CNN's top sports anchor reports that Kyler Murray was back in uniform for Sunday night’s game against Los Angeles after recovering from a knee injury sustained during last month's preseason opener; he has played well this season and hopes to lead the Cardinals team through adversity, including Monday Night Football at Arizona State next week. The head coach said about his quarterback returning: "Kyler is ready mentally and physically after recovering from a minor set-back – we trust in him on Sundays."

The Rams’ offense has been top-notch under McVay, with 28 touchdowns this season. Cardinals are looking to improve their defense against high scoring teams as they struggle for consistency without Murray at the helm - but Kubiak is positive; "We've faced some tough opponents throughout history and we’re not going into any game thinking it will be easy."

The league, aware of a struggling offense in Phoenix this year has given cardinals extra timeouts per half to allow for better player substitution strategies - but Kubiak is confident his team's spirit can overcome the physical deficit on the field; "Our heart and desire are there. We’ll find ways as we improve our chemistry back at home."

The Rams also had a strong debut under new offensive coordinator Kevin O'Connell, with Kyler Murray contributing two touchdowns last weekend alone - but that performance may not be sustainable; "As always," said McVay when asked about the possibility of losing his star player. “We’ve got to focus on winning as a team and preparing ourselves for all outcomes.” 

Both teams will take their playoff aspirations into next weekend, where they'll face each other again in Arizona - it could be an intriguing game of strengths vs
