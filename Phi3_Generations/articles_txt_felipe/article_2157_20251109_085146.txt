Somerset to Introduce Weekend Cheese Festival Amid Pandemic Concerns; Local Businesses Hopeful but Cautious  

Bath and Somerset - This Saturday will be a celebration of the British cheese tradition as Travel Town announces its first-ever weekend food festival. The event, now in its fourth year since it began virtually during lockdown restrictions last spring, is set to bring together local dairy farms with artisan producers and international guests for an immersive taste experience amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

The Somerset Cheese Festival will kick off at 2 p end of Saturday from Travel Town's community center (645, Westgate Ave) and continue through Sunday afternoon with cheeses representing various regions across Britain as well international imports for a worldwide flavor profile comparable to its global audience. Overall attendance is expected around the modest 300 people mark after initial reports estimated double that number in pre-pandemic times.

"Cheese has been an integral part of British culture and cuisine, and this festival celebrates both our local producers who have weathered significant challenges during COVID-19 restrictions as well as the resilience they represent," said Samantha Lee, chairperson for Travel Town's Somerset Cheese Festival. "We want to bring people together in a safe environment that offers them an authentic British culinary experience."

The festival includes cheeses such as Lancashire and Cheddar from local producers; Wensleydale (from Scotland), Roquefort, Comté, Munster, Taleggio - Gruyère, Manchego, Brie de Meaux – all types of Camembert along with goat's cheese varieties are being brought in by international importers. Attendees will also have access to a specialized sommelier service offering wine and beer pairings alongside regional ciders for each featured dairy product available at the festival.

The town hall council has worked closely with local health authorities, imposing strict social distancing measures including mandatory mask-wearing indoors and limited capacity in all enclosed spaces during event hours from 2 end to 4 pm on Sunday afternoon (for a three hour window before cooler temperatures). All attendees are required to show proof of vaccination or have received their second dose within the last two months.

"We believe this festival is an opportunity for locals and visitors alike to celebrate our cheese culture here in Travel Town while still respecting public health guidelines," said Mayor Thomas O'Connor, who emphasized strict adherence of these rules by both event organizers as well attendees. "We understand concerns about large gatherings during the pandemic but we hope that our community will see this festival not just as an opportunity to explore new flavors and expand their culinary horizzons."

In addition, food vendors who attend are being asked by council officials on Saturday afternoon for a voluntary health screening ahead of time. Attendees with symptoms or no recent negative COVID tests will be barred entry as per the event's policy set forth to ensure public safety and comfort during festival hours.

With an emphasis placed upon local producers, attendee interaction is limited within booth lines that run around a central cheese board for pairing tastings which features small samples of each available variety alongside its respective
