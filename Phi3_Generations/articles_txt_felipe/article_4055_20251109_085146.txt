In a groundbredependent breakthrough at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center in Ohio on Wednesday, researchers announced that they successfully used gene therapy to treat patients with Rett Syndrome – an incredibly rare and progressive neurological disorder primarily affecting girls. This remarkable achievement provides new hope for families who have struggled with the debilitating effects of this condition which typically worsens over time, often leaving individuals dependent on others due to severe physical impairments.

"We are ecstatic about our team's success today," said Dr. Emily Stone, lead researcher in neurological disorders at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center during the press conference held earlier this week. "For years we have tried to find a way for these young girls and women who suffer from Rett Syndrome that is not invasive or has long-term side effects, but with gene therapy, today may be their day."

Rett syndrome affects about one in every 10,000 live female births according to the National Organization for Rare Disorders. It usually presents itself after an infant's first year and is characterized by a period of normal development followed by regression where affected children may lose skills they once had like purposeful hand use or communication abilities until around two years old when symptoms start worsening, leading to severe physical impairments that often include problems with speech, movement and coordination.

The treatment used for this groundbreaking gene therapy targets a mutation in the MECP2 gene which leads Rett Syndrome's development of its neurological symptoms while avoiding possible harmful side effects seen earlier when treatments were first introduced to clinical trials back in 2009. In these early attempts, researchers administered a viral vector carrying the healthy gene into patient cells directly but found that many patients experienced fevers and fatigue along with their original symptoms as well as experiencing temporary hair loss – an effect known to come from some forms of genetic therapy using adeno-associated virus (AAV) which binds DNA.

In comparison, the method employed by Cincinnati Children's has evolved and uses a different type called 'CRISPR-Cas9', developed for editing genomes with more precision than previous techniques while also avoiding off target effects that may have unintended consequences elsewhere in the body’s cells.

According to clinical trial data, after receiving this new gene therapy method on a monthly basis over three months at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center along with physical and occupational therapies which are essential components for Rett Syndrome management as well – patients experienced significant improvement in their quality of life without experiencing any harmful side effects that had been reported before.

"I am just overwhelmed by how much my daughter has started to communicate again," said Sarah Williams, a mother whose 14-year-old girl underwent the gene therapy treatment and witnessed her abilities returning after years of regressive behavior following diagnosis at age two. "She is beginning to show signs that she can express herself better than ever before - it's almost like having my little angel back."

The researchers will continue monitoring these patients over the next 24 months with additional clinical trials taking place as more children and young women are able access this life-changing
