CNN/Los Angeles – Early Friday morning, pre-market trading on Wall Street showed a significant downturn for tech stocks as concerns over potential interest rate hikes weighed heavily in the minds of investors. The Nasdaq and Dow Jones both experienced their steepest declines since early September 2018 when fears about trade tariffs were at their peak, with the technology sector being particularly affected due to its sensitivity to economic cycles.

Several analysts have been watching closely as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is set to testify before Congress this week regarding monetary policy and potential rate hikes later in 2019. As of now, some are even speculating a possible two or three increases by the end of next year which could send ripples through tech stocks that rely heavily on borrowing for capital to fund research and development efforts within their industry giants like Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc., Facebook Inc., Amazon.com Inc., and Microsoft Corp.

A spokespsondelicensed broker from a leading Wall Street firm in downtown New York shares his thoughts on the situation, stating that "it's definitely unsettling to see these tech giants taking hits while we await more clarity regarding Fed policies and how they may influence market behavior. We urge investors not to make impulsive decisions but rather assess their risk tolerance levels."

In this time of uncertainty, financial experts advise caution; however, some believe there are silver linings amid the storm clouds: "Despite today's downturn in pre-market trading for tech stocks and potential interest rate hikes," said economist Dr. Susan O'Malley from Columbia University School of Business on Tuesday, “the market will likely rebound soon because history has shown us that it always finds a way to correct itself."

Investors are hoping these downturns in tech stock prices don’t spill over into the broader market. However with interest rates poised for an increase this year and inflation hovering around 2% - above target – most believe that there won't be a major recession but rather more cautious investment strategies ahead, especially in industries sensitive to economic changes such as tech.

With the Fed’s testimony next week and interest rate hikes looming further on the horizon, all eyes are now firmly fixed on Wall Street hoping for stability amidst these uncertain times.
