Eight-year-injured NBA veteran Jason Collins is set to make a comeback at this Saturday's game between the Boston Celtics and Brooklyn Nets. The former star center from Stanford University played overseas for six seasons before joining the New Jersey/Newark team in 2011, where he made his name known as one of the most versatile big men on international courts today—a skill set that will now be tested back home at a professional level.

"Returning after eight years and an injury is no easy feat," says Collins' agent Rickis Gomez during yesterday’s press conference held in Boston, MA where Collins officially joined the team for pre-season training camps—after he signed his one-year contract last month. "Jason has proven himself time and again to be a talented athlete who can play any position on the floor with equal confidence."

The news was not unexpected as fans eagerly awaited Collins' return following years of rumors circulating in social media circles about him possibly making his comeback while playing overseas. The former NBA star, originally diagnosed back in 2013 has been working tirelessly at the EuroCup championship level with team Barnet to get ready for a professional basketball season since he returned home three years ago after spending seasons abroad—in Turkey's Super Lig and France’s LNBP.

"Collins brings experience, poise on court under pressure which is vital in today's competitive environment," notes NBC Sports NBA expert commentator Jay Williams during a pre-game interview yesterday as the team practiced their defensive schemes for Saturday night against Brooklyn—a familiar and challenging opponent. "Jason still hasn’t fully recovered from his injury, but he has been in top shape physically since joining Barnet last season."

Today's match represents a significant milestone not only for the Celtics roster this summer after losing to New York during their final weekend together as Nets players before moving apart and going head-to-head with each other, but also marks another step forward in Collins’ career. The former All American from Stanford has played overseas since his collegiate days—most notably for the L'Orphelin d'Alessandria team based out of Italy as well a season playing at Adelaide 36ers and Sydney Kings, two teams competing in Australia’s National Basketball League (NBL).

“Returning to NBA after years abroad was never easy; he had an unconventional path,” says former Boston Celtics coach Doc Rivers back during Collins' days with the team. “But Jason always brought something unique on court that we loved having around – his versatility is second-to-none.”

With over 40 years of professional experience, including four seasons playing in Europe (Italy and France) as well spending three other seasons abroad competing for Adelaide Demons under Australian rules football; Collins' international career has been anything but conventional. Yet somehow he still managed to keep a steady basketball rhythm throughout his journey which is truly admirable among veteran players, especially one recovering from an injury during years of practice back home in the States—before returning for this upcoming season against Brooklyn at TD Garden on Saturday night (10/25).
