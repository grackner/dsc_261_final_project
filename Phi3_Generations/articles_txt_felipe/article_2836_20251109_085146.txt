In an unprecedented maritime event off the coast of Darwin on Friday afternoon, a pod of over thirty killer whales was observed swimming unusually close to shore for extended periods before retreating back into deeper waters by evening. The National Tidal Centre (NTC) received multiple reports between 2 PM and 8 PM local time when residents reported seeing the cetacean congregations near Bremer Bay, approximately 150 miles south of Darwin.

This unusual behavior has puzzled marine biologists who are monitoring the situation closely due to an increase in killer whale sightings along Australia's northern coastline over recent months which they believe may be linked to declining food sources such as salmon and herring, believed by some experts to correlate with ocean warming trends.

"We haven't seen this level of activity near the mainland for years," said Dr. Emma Thompson from Australia Marine Mammals Research Institute (AMMRI). "It appears they are seeking new feeding grounds." 

The phenomenon was witnessed by local fisherman Ben Smith, who noted that he and his companions had never seen anything like it before: "We were just doing our usual haul when we spotted the whales about three miles offshore. They seemed to be following us for a bit," recalled Mr. Smith during an interview with AMMRI researchers present at sea.

While killer whale visits are not uncommon in Australia, especially around Christmas and New Year periods when they congregate near feeding grounds along the northern coastline like Port Essington or Darwin Harbour, this particular event appears to defy normal migratory patterns observed over several years. 

Dr. Michael Grant from NTC stated: "The last time we saw such behavior was during a particularly poor season for whales." The National Tidal Centre has launched an immediate investigation into these unusual sightings and is collaborating with the Department of Agriculture, Water Resources, and Environment (DAWE) to assess potential impacts on marine life ecosystem dynamics.

As research continues into understanding this aberrant behavior in killer whales off Australia's coastline, scientists are urging locals not to approach or disturb them while they seek new feeding grounds near the mainland as a safety precaution for both humans and animals alike.
