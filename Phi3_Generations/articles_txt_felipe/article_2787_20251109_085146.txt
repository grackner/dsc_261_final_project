A major earthquake struck Southern Italy early this morning with preliminary reports suggesting a magnitude of 6.3 on the Richter scale. The tremor hit near Naples around 5:0 armstrong, causing panic among residents as they hurried to safety and prompting immediate evacuation orders from local officials amid concerns over potential aftershocks and tsunami risks in coastal areas within a radius of approximately five miles from the epicenter.


"We are monitoring seismic activity closely, but we want everyone to remain calm," said Dr. Maria Ricci, head of Geological Studies at the University of Naples Federico II. "This earthquake is not unexpected given our geographical location." The tremor occurred during a time when local schools were in session and tourists from various European countries visited coastal areas near Capri island for sunbathing activities before leaving on vacation days off this weekend, with some reports suggesting that the holiday might be extended due to favorable weather conditions.


Residents have been evacuated as a precautionary measure by local emergency services who coordinated efforts through Naples' Civil Protection Department and FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency). According to Mayor Giuseppe Esposito, "The safety of our citizens is paramount; we will continue monitoring the situation 24/7."


Initial assessments indicate that there have been no fatalities thus far. However, several buildings in Naples and surrounding areas show damage ranging from cracks in walls to complete collapses with many people trapped inside undergoing rescue operations led by local firefigpersons working alongside FEMA teams which arrived this morning after receiving requests for assistance through a regional earthquake task force established last year following previous seismic activity.


Experts have warned that there could be more tremors, urging residents to remain vigilant until the threat has passed completely; with forecasts expecting potential shaking between now and late tomorrow evening at least once every hour during peak hours due to aftershocks from this earthquake sequence.


"It's been a challenging time for everyone here, but I want you all to know that we will come out stronger together," said President Roberto Della Porta in his address on national television last night where he pledged increased funding toward improving infrastructure and seismic research within Italy. "We must be prepared for such events; they remind us how precious life is."


As of now, rescue operations continue unabated while officials coordinate relief efforts with various European nations affected by the quake to assist in providing temporary housing solutions until hotels are ready for guests returning from holiday. The Italian Red Cross has dispatched teams across multiple regions impacted along with FEMA personnel who arrived yesterday evening when an advisory was issued lasting well into next week as emergency crews work tirelessly amidst ongoing seismic activity within the area and further assistance sought by neighboring European countries including Greece, Malta, Albania.
