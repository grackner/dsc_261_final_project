"Amidst growing concerns over election security and integrity in America's democratic process, a new report has raised alarms about potential vulnerabilities just days before Election Day on November 3rd. According to an internal memo leaked by whistleblower Alexa Johnston from the Cybersecurity Division of Homeland Security Department (DHS), there are reported weaknesses in several states' systems, including New Jersey and Pennsylvania."

"The document highlights a worrying gap that has left millions susceptible to cyber threats. With Election Day rapidly approaching on November 3rd, the concerns over security have been thrust into sharp relief for state officials who are racing against time with only three weeks remaining until voters head to polls in New Jersey and Pennsylvania."

"The memo detailed multiple potential risks that could compromise critical election infrastructure. These include susceptibility to ransomware attacks, unautcurate data backups, outdated software, insufficient staff training on cybersecurity best practices, and poorly implemented multi-factor authentication," explained Johnston in the memo which was leaked internally last Wednesday."

"The DHS has not yet confirmed or denied these claims but acknowledged receiving questions about their severity. As of this week, New Jersey's Secretary of State said her office is 'working closely with state officials and federal agencies to mitigate any potential threats.' Meanwhile, Pennsylvania Deputy Governor John Butkis stated that his administration has been aware for some time but didn’t disclose the exact reasons."

"A cybersecurity expert from Harvard University was contacted by CNN about these concerns. They emphasized 'the urgency of this situation cannot be understated,' adding, "The integrity and security of elections is at stake here... The findings should act as a wake-up call for all."

As Election Day draws nearer on November 3rd in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, the concerns raised by internal memos have sent shockwaves through political circles nationwide. These fears highlight not only potential flaws within systems but also question America's commitment to preserving a free and fair election process."

"The next steps for these states are unclear as they navigate this sensitive issue in the race, just days away from Election Day on November 3rd. Official responses have been cautiously optimistic about remediation efforts underway but no timeline was provided when asked by local news outlets."
