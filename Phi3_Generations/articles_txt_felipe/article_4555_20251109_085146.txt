Maria Sharapova's suspension from professional tennis raises questions on fair play and image restoration in sports celebrities amid growing concerns over doping practices worldwide. The Russian former No.1 player was stripped of her titles at the WTA Finals, which concluded yesterday after eight grueling days packed with intense matches showcasing some of tennis' top athletes.

Sharapova announced on Monday that she would forfeit all her past and present championships due to a violation related to Therapeutic Use Exemptions (TUE). According to the World Anti-Doping Agency, Sharapova had accumulated more than 60 TUEs during her career - allowing medications that could potentially enhance athletic performance. This led USTA representatives and WTA officials to suspend Sharapova for two years without playing in any tournament until the end of this season on January 21, marking a significant fall from grace as one of tennis' most successful figures ever.

"The decision was not taken lightly," said Dr. James Carter, an expert who specializes in sports ethics and has been following Sharapova's case closely since her first TUE request back in 2tyteyear ago. "But after extensive analysis of the available evidence over years – including unannounced drug tests that were conducted several times at various stages - it is clear Ms. Sharapova knowingly took advantage."

CNN has learned from reliable sources within Tennis Federation and WTA representatives discussions to be tougher on their owners' conduct in recent months after seeing the number of top sports celebrities facing similar issues increase dramatically worldwide since 2018, with allegations ranging from performance-enhancing substance abuse through bribery and corruption.

"We all appreciate her immense contributions to tennis," said USTA CEO Ted Molloy after the announcement was made on Monday night in New York City during a press conference attended by some of Sharapova's most loyal fans who are just as distressed with this news, which includes forfeiting five titles she won while competing under her mother-in-law Elena Dementieva.

Sharapova is appealing the decision but may face a public relations struggle to redeem herself once again in tennis circles that have been divided over their feelings on TUEs and Ms. Sharapova's case from day one as an emerging player back when such practices weren’t well-known or even accepted among players at the time of her rise, which began with a victory over top American Serena Williams in 2013 at Wimbledon aged only twenty years old.

"I just wanted to be on my court and play for myself," Sharapova told reporters before being suspended last night when asked about the TUEs that she had accumulated over her career, which included a medical exemption certificate issued by Russian doctors in 2014. "All I focused was just getting better every single day."

"I'm heartbroken to see such an incredible athlete suffer this way," said tennis coach and former pro Dane DeHaan who trained Sharapova at several tournaments throughout her career, reflecting the sentiments of many fans when asked about their thoughts. "Her loss is our gain as players should compete fairly for medals."
