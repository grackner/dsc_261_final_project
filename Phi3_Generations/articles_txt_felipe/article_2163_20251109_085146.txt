A Hollywood blockbuster has been delayed by six months amid production issues in California's sunny locales where shooting originally took place this summer. The action-packed film adaptation of the popular novel is now slated to wrap up its final weeks on set sometime later next year instead of earlier as initially planned, sources close to the project have confirmed to CNN and DailyMail.
