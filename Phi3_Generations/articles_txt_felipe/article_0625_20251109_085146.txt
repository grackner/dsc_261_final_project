As of Wednesday afternoon local time in Atlanta, there are concerns that a recent change to ice maintenance procedures at downtown rinks may be contributing to an uptick in player injuries across the city's youth hockey leagues. Official reports indicate nearly a doubling of sprained wrists and strained muscles since November when new cooling techniques were introduced, according to Atlanta Youth Hockey Association figures obtained by CNN on Tuesday night.

Hockey season is booming in Georgia this winter after years without professional teams operating locally; interest appears high among all ages groups with a 25% increase over last year's player registrations across the state recorded just two months into the campaign, reports say as of Wednesday morning (US time). The new cooling techniques were believed to improve ice quality and speed up repairs after skating sessions. But local hockey players appear worried about increased risks on icy surfaces when a rapid drop in temperature hit late last month - temperatures that are typical for the southern state, reports say as of Wednesday morning (US time).

"We were all excited to see more games and rinks open up. I just wish there was no injury risk involved," said Emily Smith, mother to two young hockey players aged 8-10 in Atlanta's suburb of Roswell yesterday at the local arena where her kids play weekly with friends after school hours (US time).

Smith wasn't alone. At least five other concerned parents were present for a meeting held by an association coach and league head referee about safety measures being taken to minimize injury risk during games on Thursday afternoon at the same local arena where Smith brought her children, reports say as of yesterday (US time). The officials did not provide details regarding what changes they may have made in response but offered assurance that their top priority was player safety.

Dr. Susan Johnson is a sports medicine physician who works with Atlanta-area hockey teams and referees to assess the risk of injuries during games, reports say as of yesterday (US time). She spoke at Thursday's meeting about new techniques being used by rink employees in maintaining ice quality after skating sessions.

"We want better playing conditions on a more regular basis - but not at any cost," said Johnson. "Within the past few months, we have seen an increase in sprained wrist and strained muscle injuries among young athletes aged 6-14 here locally; this is concerning as it could lead to long term health issues."

At least ten parents voiced their concerns during Thursday's meeting with the coach - including Johnson. Parents asked questions about when changes would be implemented and what steps they should take if any injuries were sustained on home rinks, according to published minutes from the event (US time). The league head referee assured them that he was exploring all options possible for making necessary improvements while emphasizing an open-minded approach.

"It's our duty as officials and coaches here in Atlanta to do everything we can to provide safe playing environments at home rinks," said the League Head Referee, Greg Thompson (US time). "We need better communication with parents regarding what is being done locally around maintaining ice quality for their children."

Follow-up meetings between local hockey associations and league head referees will be held next week in Atlanta as discussions continue. No decisions have been made yet about concrete changes, but experts believe they are necessary
