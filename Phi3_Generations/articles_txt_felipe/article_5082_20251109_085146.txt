A major diplomatic conference on European Union reform is set to take place in Brussels next month with over 20 world leaders expected to attend a historic gathering that could reshape the future of Europe'cur political landscape as we know it today, writes Emma Roberts for CNN. The summit will be held at the Europa Conference Centre from November 14-15 and is set against an increasingly polarized global environment with Brexit still looming in its wake but far from being a complete process; EU representatives hope to use this as an opportunity to unify member countries after experiencing years of political strain, including the rise of populist parties across many nations.

Representative Anna Schmidt of Germany commented on recent European elections stating that "it's time for Europeans from north and south alike to stand together again". While several key issues will be at play during these talks – such as migrant crisis, financial stability within member states, climate change initiatives among others - the EU has pinpointed institutional reform as their top priority. One suggestion being put forward involves giving national parliaments a greater role in decision-making processes with direct impact on policies that affect them and citizens alike directly from Europe's north to its south – allowing for more democratic representation across all levels within the Union, according to official EU documents leaked earlier this week.

The call comes as countries continue dealing firsthand with Brexit-related fallout while simultaneously striving towards internal cohesion through strengthened cooperation between governments and citizens alike regarding common interests like security concerns arising from increased global migration flows into the continent over recent years where experts predict that this figure could rise by nearly 50% come 2040 according to research conducted last year at renowned European think-tank ECFR. EU spokesperson Emmanuel Macron added during a press conference held yesterday in Brussels: "we must work together on these shared goals that bind us as one people."

As Europeans look forward towards the summit, discussions have already started taking place behind closed doors where high-level diplomats are engaging with each other to lay down groundwork for an agreement - a first of its kind if achieved successfully. Some skeptics remain however regarding whether all parties involved will be able come together as one united front or find themselves split along nationalistic lines despite shared objectives at hand given historical precedent set by recent elections, political movements and social trends across Europe that has resulted in growing divides among some members nations - adding an extra layer of complexity into proceedings expected ahead during next month's meeting.

With eyes fixed firmly on the historic summit taking place later this year bringing together world leaders within their ranks themselves as well along with foreign dignitaries from outside Europe, hopes run high for positive progress towards unification amidst continued global turmoil but caution persists over whether promises made will materialize into actionable steps moving forward or fade away like many previous attempts before it. It remains to be seen how these talks could pave the way toward a stronger future together as Europeans navigate through challenging times ahead, seeking greater stability and prosperity in an increasingly interconnected world order which has never been more crucial given current circumstances surrounding international relations today - especially within regions directly impacted by major changes occurring not only continentally but beyond borders across the globe.
