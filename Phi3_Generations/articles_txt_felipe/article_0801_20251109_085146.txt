Topic: Travel - Lodging and Hotels

In a surprising announcement yesterday in New York City on March 12th, President Joe Biden plans to make an unexpected visit by himself and his family to one of the city's most iconic luxury hotels: The Plaza Hotel as part of their extended trip across America. It comes after months spent studying American culture from afar.

The tourists-turned-politicians will check in at around 3 p.m., arriving just before dusk, to spend a weekend immersed among the city's elite and history buffs while observing their presidential campaign rallies scheduled throughout Manhattan later this spring. The move has raised eyebrows across both political spectrums as they continue gatherings in front of packed crowds amidst COVID-19 fears that are now more prevalent than ever before due to new variants appearing almost every other day at alarming rates worldwide, CNN reported yesterday afternoon on March 12th.

"The Plaza is an integral part of American history and culture," a spokespner for the hotel said in statement sent by email this morning regarding their guests' arrival plans; adding further details were under review since initial speculations surfaced when someone leaked information to social media platforms yesterday evening that Biden was heading down there.

During an impromptu press conference held earlier today, White House spokesperson Jen Psaki shared with reporters present at the event: "The President and his family will be staying in one of New York City's most iconic hotels to engage closely with local communities across our nation as they journey through America."

A retired city planning professor, Dr. Richard Thompson who specializes on historic sites within metropolitan areas shared some thoughts about the move saying "It’s not just a hotel; it represents significant moments in history - this makes Biden's stay there even more impactful," while visiting his granddaughter at another luxury accommodation nearby yesterday evening.

Several local historians have also weighed-in about the event with their reactions, some saying that seeing him interact closely amidst society will give them hope for a united future despite deep divides within our nation right now where divisions seem to grow wider by daylight; others fear his presence might incite further division due to stark differences on issues like immigration policies.

Experts have weighed-in about the decision saying that Biden staying at The Plaza is a "symbolic gesture of healing, unity," after months spent studying American culture from afar during which Trump's administration has often criticized him for being too close to foreign nations and leaders. A sociologist who studies politics on Capitol Hill explained: “The decision sends powerful messages about how we can move forward together.”

Hoteliers have been quick in their reactions with some saying it will boost business while others are unsure as they recall a time when Biden was often criticized for staying at various hotels to conduct his campaigns. New York-based hotelier, John Doe told reporters today: "The Plaza's rich history resonates strongly within me personally – seeing him here is reaffirmation of democracy and hope."
