A massive traffic jam on London's M25 motorway caused chaos for over five hours yesterday afternoon as a result of an unexpected accident involving multiple vehicles and emergency responders. The incident occurred around 1pm near Junction 7, just outside the city center, where two trucks collided while transporting crucial medical supplies to several hospitals across London on National Health Service (NHS) day.

The collision drew hundreds of police cars and ambulances into the already busy motorway in an attempt to clear a path for emergency vehicles amidst thick fog rolling through South East England that same afternoon, bringing traffic grinding to halt between Junctions 10-49 by around 3pm. By then, over four hundred lanes of road had been closed off temporarily due to the incident and subsequent heavy demand from stranded motorists seeking assistance on social media platforms like Twitter as well as at local service stations along a detour route leading northwest towards Cheshire in North West England.

Transport for London (TfL) spokespener Emily Shanks confirmed that 12 ambulances, three fire engines and five police cars were involved initially before more emergency vehicles joined the fray; however numbers quickly ballooned as local hospitals across Surrey Heath Council area began to rely heavily on medical supplies brought in by road rather than rail transportation due to delayed arrivals caused directly or indirectly because of yesterday's accident and still uncooperative weather conditions.

She added that by time she managed an update on her Facebook status at 5pm it had been circulated thousands times, with many of those reading sharing their own stories and pictures taken moments afterward while waiting for help or witnessing first-hand chaos unfold outside Junction 17 near Leatherhead station.

TfL issued a press release yesterday afternoon announcing that traffic flow would gradually be restored across most affected areas in London throughout the remainder of today with some disruptions likely to continue well into tomorrow as services resume back-to-normal overnight and Monday morning, although delays were expected during rush hour periods between 7am -10 am; additionally they urged all motorists traveling through South East England on or around NHS day Friday (April 26th) to be aware of potential hazards caused by thick fog rolling in from the coast which was likely due arrive today, leaving roads more treacherous than usual.

The Metropolitan Police provided an update yesterday afternoon advising residents and commuters that investigations into multiple vehicle collisions at various
