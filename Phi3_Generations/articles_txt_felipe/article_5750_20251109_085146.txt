Early this morning in New York City, a sudden and unexpected market crash has jolted Wall Street as stock prices plummeted by over 10% within minutes of trading opening at 9:30 AM ET on Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average took an especially hard hit, shedding nearly two thousand points in its initial drop before stabilizing somewhat later during the day's volatility.

As chaos ensued within financial circles and investors rushed to secure their positions amidst growing uncertainty, some market experts are seeking answers as to what caused this shocking downturn that is impacting markets worldwide from Shanghai to Paris with varying degrees of severity. While no official statement has been issued by the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or other regulatory bodies at press time, rumors circulate about potential inside trading activities linked to prominent hedge funds based in New York City which could have sparked this chain reaction across markets globally as of 10:45 AM ET.

"This is a situation that demands immediate attention and transparency," said Susan McNamee, CEO at Bright Future Investments who specializes in market trend analysis. "Until we have clarity on what exactly went wrong here today, investors must proceed with caution when making decisions."

The abrupt drop was witnessed across most major stock indices including the S&P 500 which also lost more than a thousand points during early trading hours while tech giants like Apple and Microsoft saw sharp declines in their respective shares. The Nasdaq, heavily impacted by high-frequency trading firms that dominate its composition of technology stocks was down over two percent at 10:57 AM ET before retracting slightly as the situation unfolded further throughout Wall Street's fluctuating hours during which it remained in bear territory until midday.

Adding to this alarm, multiple analysts have pointed out irregular trading patterns that began late Tuesday evening when high-frequency firms engaged significantly more heavily than usual on certain stock trades leading up towards today's open resulting potentially trigger a cascading sell-off across markets globally as early signs of trouble started appearing yesterday.

"We noticed unusual volume spikes in specific sectors ahead of the crash, which could indicate insider trading or market manipulation," explained Richard Grant Jr., senior advisor at Market Watchers Group and a former Wall Street trader himself who now fights for fairer practices within capital markets having previously worked on high-frequency strategies. "Until we have an official investigation into these anomalies, all eyes are fixated firmly upon the SEC to take action."

As traders scramble amidst escalating panic and news outlets worldwide report live from inside NYSE headquarters where officials continue trying vainly in their efforts to calm fears while determining next steps for investors, several questions linger about how such an unprecedented event could occur so rapidly without immediate regulatory intervention.

CNN reached the SEC's Washington office with no statement issued by press time yet officials did make contact this morning regarding concerns over these market irregularities but declined to comment further outside official channels until a more comprehensive investigation has been conducted into all potential causes and consequences of today's crash which they insist is still underway.
