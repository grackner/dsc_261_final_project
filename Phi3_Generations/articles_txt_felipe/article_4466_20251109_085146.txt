A massive fire erupted at a bustling marketplace in Lagos early this morning, leaving hundreds homeless and destroying over two dozen food stalls by its conclusion around midday according to the Nigerian Fire Service (NIS). Witnesses say that thick black smoke billowed out of Market 21 before dawn.


The fire started sometime between midnight and early morning, with initial assessments suggesting it might have been caused accidentally due to faulty electrical wiring in one stall which caught ablaze first; however, investigations are ongoing as this incident is under federal scrutinization for potential arson given its scale.


"We had no warning," says a displaced vendor named Uzoma Okoro who has been running his small but popular eatery in Market 21 for over seven years before the flames engulfed it completely yesterday afternoon. "My life's work, gone up in smoke." The devastating blaze affected mostly residential areas near market where people have lost not just their shelters and possessions but also livelihoods as many vendors reside at Market 21 along with operating from there daily to provide for themselves and families.


Authorities are currently conducting an investigation into the cause of the fire which began before dawn when smoke first appeared in areas surrounding market, causing panic among residents who quickly evacuated their homes out of caution as thick black plumes rose skyward at sunrise reaching almost a mile above ground level. As rescue efforts got underway shortly after that time it wasn’t until 3 hours later on the afternoon shift when firefighters managed to control and finally extinguish flames which had spread over three blocks within four-hour span from its inception - making this one of largest known fires recorded so far during Nigeria's dry season.

The estimated damages now surpass N50 million mark as well 23 injuries including children have been reported since emergency services arrived shortly after the fire started but thankfully no fatalities were noted yet reports suggest several homeless families still in shelters are struggling emotionally due to loss of their home which has not only meant displacement from work locations nor permanent residences for them.

"It's a very tough time," says Minister Ayo Olubode speaking at the scene yesterday afternoon after inspecting damages himself; he adds that local government is currently working with private aid groups as well NIS and international bodies like United Nations who have already pledged financial assistance towards reconstruction efforts - but all these help may take some months before real rebuilding can start again.

As Market 21 continues its recovery plan, several other markets across Lagos city are preparing themselves in case something similar happens on their side due to increased attention from government after this unfortunate incident which will no doubt serve as wake-up call towards stricter enforcement regulations among vendors' business licensing procedures including regular fire safety inspections.

With many lives forever altered by loss of homes, possessions and livelihoods due to fires happening increasingly more frequently especially in Nigeria’s dry season where temperatures soar above 35 degrees Celsi0us causing vegetation around residential zones too become highly flammable; the federal government must find a way through both short-term as well long term relief measures aimed not only towards assisting victims with immediate necessities but also reforms that would help prevent future
