A massive oil spill has occurred off the coast of Gabon in West Africa as a tanker collided with an unidentified submerged object near Loango Bay on Friday morning. The incident led to over two million gallons of crude being released into pristine waters, which are known for their biodiversity and serve as critical habitat for several endangered marine species.

A spokespner from the National Oil Company revealed that efforts were already underway to contain and clean up the environmental disaster before sunset on Saturday in Gabon City harbor where initial operations will take place around 10am local time, supported by a multinational team of expert responders.

"The oil tanker was carrying approximately 2 million gallons when it hit," explained Captain Alain Dubois, spokesperson for the National Oil Company. "It's an unfortunate situation that we are dealing with."

Gabonese Minister of Marine Affairs, Dr. Lillian Bello-Nkunda said her office was deeply concerned about this incident and its impact on marine life in one of Africa’s richest biodiversity hotspots: “We can't let the oil spill destroy these beautiful habitats where rare species like green sea turtles come to feed,” she remarked.

The disaster happened at around 9am local time (12 noon GMT) near Loango Bay, about 50 miles from Gabon City Harbor on a windy Thursday morning when the cargo ship Oryx Explorer collided with an unidentified object submerged underneath. Authorities have yet to determine what caused this collision and are still investigating the incident while dealing with its aftermaths, which include oil-covered marine life sightings across miles of coastline in recent days according to witnesses on standby for collection purposes since Saturday morning (2 pm GMT).

Environmental expert Dr. Emmanuel Mbaya from Pan African Marine Institute commented that they expected a significant impact: "We're looking at immediate harmful effects, but long-term ones as well - this kind of spill can affect food chains for years." He also voiced concern over how swiftly nature might recover given its delicate ecosystem.

A local fisherman from Sébaté Village who was among the first to spot oil slicks while out early Sunday morning (1am GMT) told CNN Local, "We saw floating black blobs on water at sunrise - no bird or animal came near it because they could smell something wrong. My whole village knows about this."

A government official from Gabon’s Ministry of Marine Affairs and Environment shared that there was a plan to deploy dispersants within hours, but international maritime experts suggested caution: “Dispersant use can help break down oil into smaller particles; however if misused or over-applied it could harm the marine life we are trying so hard to protect.” Dr. Bello said her office would ensure proper application with strict monitoring and evaluation procedures in place for any such activities, but added that time was of essence: "We hope there is still a chance recovery - this needs swift action."

Gabonese President Ali-Bongo has called an emergency meeting tomorrow (today) at 10am local to discuss further actions alongside foreign counterparts including Nigeria and Cameroon. This incident which could potentially have devastating impact on Gabon's economy - particularly its
