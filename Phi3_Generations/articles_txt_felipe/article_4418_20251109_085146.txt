A powerful cold front swept through Southern California last night with wind speeds reaching up to 60 miles per hour and temperatures plummeting as much as ten degrees below the seasonal average for this time of year, according to local meteorologists at KTLA. The sudden shift in weather brought about a slew of unexpected snowfall events across mountainous regions like San Bernardino National Forest near Los Angeles County on Tuesday evening into Wednesday morning.


This rare atmospheric occurrence caught many by surprise, as Southern California'static winter season typically brings mild temperatures and sunshine rather than heavy precipitation or snowfall to these areas," stated meteorologist Emily Chen of KTLA Weather Center in Los Angeles on Tuesday evening. "Snow clouds rolled over the San Bernardino National Forest for several hours, but they started clearing up as early Wednesday morning allowing temperatures back into a normal range."


Chen added that while these events are not commonplace at this latitude and elevation, changing climate patterns could increase such occurrences in the future. Local residents reported finding their yards blanketed with snow by dawn after last night's storm which was forecasted as just overcast skies for a mild chill.


Officials from Los Angeles County have issued statements reminding people to stay indoors when temperatures are low, and warned that the freezing ground may be hazardous due to potential ice formation on paved surfaces in areas where snowfall was heavier, such as around San Gabriel Canyon.


As a precautionary measure after these unexpected weather events, officials advise residents with outdoor animals like horses or goats for livestock purposes to ensure they have proper shelter and food supplies during this atypical cold snap that may continue through the weekend according to predictive models from CNN Weather.
