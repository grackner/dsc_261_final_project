In a stunning celebrity encounter last night in Los Angeles that's taken social media by storm, pop singer-songwriter Taylor Johnson was seen embracing with Grammy Award winner and Hollywood actor Chris Larkin outside the Roxy Theatre during their sold-out show. The duo, who reportedly reconnected at a charity event last month, surprised fans as they met up in public after months of being out of touch following personal conflicts that had unfolded on set for Johnson's latest movie project—a situation made all the more dramatic by their shared history and professional circle.

At approximately 9:30 pm PT outside LA’ endlessly buzzing Roxy Theatre, Taylor was photographed embracing Chris in a hug that has since gone viral on Instagram where both have combined over 1 million followers while the pair of them currently sit atop tens of millions collectively. Johnson tweeted to his fans "Tonight feels like it ended up being more than just another gig."

CNN and DailyMail are learning that Chris confirmed seeing Taylor outside but was unsure if they had run into one-another by accident or intentionally sought each other out, he told an assistant at the time. A rep for Johnson added "Taylor reached out after realizing how much his friend meant to him."

The pair reconnected over dinner last month and decided it would be a good idea when they found themselves in Los Angeles attending separate events on Saturday nights before running into one-another at the Roxy Theatre. Fans can't stop talking about their reunion with many hoping for them to continue collaborating beyond tonight as Chris Larkin added "The show must go on, and so do my friendships."

Johnson faced his own professional pressures last month when rumors of a fallout between him and director Robert Smith surfaced after he felt that the creative direction was being compromised. The situation escalated into public feuds which are now allegedly behind them as Chris commented "We're all friends again, let love out."

Experts on social media trends say this is exactly how such reconnections occur online and in real life. Social Psychologist Dr. Emily Thompson from Stanford University explains that when people feel they have lost something valuable or a sense of belonging it can trigger an instinctive drive to reconnect with old friends, especially if there has been positive association previously – like Chris's friendship with Taylor over dinner last month and their successful musical performance on Saturday night.

This latest encounter between the two celebrities is proof that even in Hollywood where public lives are often under a microscope it can take just one heartfelt hug to break down barriers, reconnect people, restore friendships – but also leave others guessing about intentions behind such emotional reunions. As fans continue debating the reasons for this touching encounter and share their own feelings on social media at rapid speed with over 50 million posts tagged #TaylorLarkinReunion as of today morning in Los Angeles, one thing is clear – these two stars have a bond that's stronger than just friendship.
