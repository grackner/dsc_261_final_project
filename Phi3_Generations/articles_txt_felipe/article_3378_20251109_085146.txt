Moscow to Host International Symposium on Biomimicry in Modern Building Design This Weekend

Islamabad/Nov_18_2023 - Moscow is set to host an international symposium this weekend that will explore the intersection of nature and architecture. Scheduled for November 25th, architects, engineers, ecologists, and other experts from around the globe are gathering in Russia's capital city with a keen interest in biomimicry—a practice where natural systems inspire innovative building designs that enhance sustainability without compromising beauty.

Academician Dr. Sergey Ivanovich Petrov, chairman of the organizing committee and a leading expert on eco-architecture from Moscow State University, explains: "Biomimicry isn't just about creating green buildings; it's about rethinking how we approach design by taking cues from nature itself." The event will include keynote speeches, panel discussions, workshops, and presentations across three days of intense exchange.

This groundbreaking symposium follows on the heels of an increasingly urgent conversation about environmental impacts in architectural design practices worldwide—a dialogue that has been catalyzed by recent climate events and a growing consensus around sustainability's central role within modern urban planning paradigms. Russia, despite its vast natural landscapes ranging from tundra to taiga forests as well as numerous rivers and lakes teeming with wildlife—has been an unlikely hub of architectural innovation in this field but has seen a surge in eco-conscious practices within the past decade.

Moscow's own new skyscraper, Green Tower I, built on reclaimed industrial land and featuring vertical gardens that integrate directly into its façade design—stand as an example of how Russian architects are beginning to embrace environmentally sensitive approaches more broadly in their work today. "The skyline is transforming," says Ivan Petrovich Sokolov, President of the Moscow Architectural Association and a participant in this weekend's symposium: “We have much room for improvement but it’s heartening to see green projects making headlines."

In addition to fostering collaboration amongst industry veterans who are leading research into ecological building techniques, Green Tower I will serve as the focal point of demonstrations and discussions throughout this symposium. Experts hope that these exchanges can inspire a new generation of architects across disciplines—not just in Russia but globally - to seek solutions for harmonizing development with Earth's ecosystem by incorporating natural patterns into everyday living spaces, commercial buildings and more.

“By looking at how plants adapt their growth towards sunlight or using bird feathers as inspiration for aerodynamics research,” says Professor Alexandra Fedorova from New York University School of Architecture & Planning who will present on the topic during this symposium “we can create living, breathing buildings that reduce energy consumption and improve air quality.”

Organizers anticipate outcomes ranging beyond academia. In light of climate change anxieties among city dwellers everywhere—in Russia as elsewhere - there are crossos between scientific inquiry into biomimicry at the symposium with consumer interest levels for sustainable living spaces, potentially sparking increased demand and investment in green building projects across Moscow
