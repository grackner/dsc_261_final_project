Houston Astros pitcher Justin Verlander faces suspension for betting on games he'd play in against his teammates; MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred confirms the action taken as of Friday, August 10th. Official announcement was made at a press conference held downtner Houston with representatives from both Major League Baseball (MLB) and Astros organization present.


According to official statements released by MLB President Rob Manfred on Wednesday, Justin Verlander has been suspended without pay for the remainder of the regular season due to his betting activities. This decision comes after an investigation revealed that between January 1st and July 20th, Mr. Verlander made questionable wagers totaling over $50,000 against teammates from the Houston Astros on various MLB games during their regular season play in San Francisco for a local bar league tournament.


Manfred stated at his press conference that "Verlander's actions have breached our integrity rules and he will not set an example of conducting business outside organized baseball." The suspension applies to the end of both 2019 regular season when Verlander was scheduled for six starts against Astros, as well as any rehabilitation work this fall.


Inside sources shared that several teammates became aware in late June after noticing unusual financial activities on their credit cards following away game trips to San Francisco. One pitcher reportedly said: "I never saw him with bets or anything, so I was totally shocked when my name appeared tied up."


MLB spokesperson Kevin Goldstein explained that the league has strict policies in place regarding personal conduct outside of baseball and this case is not an isolated incident. He stated at another press conference held on August 3rd: "Our policy against gambling within our sport, including making wagers related to teammates or other players, remains strong."


Astros' General Manager Jeffrey Sarris discussed the matter with his staff and shared that they are striving for unity as a club while ensuring transparency about such issues. He said at Monday afternoon’s meeting: "As an organization, we believe it is essential to set high ethical standards not just in baseball but every aspect of our lives."


The news sent shockwaves through the Houston Astros fanbase who felt betrayed by someone on their team and looked for ways to reconcile with both Verlander's suspension as well as maintaining a sense of loyalty toward their home city’s beloved franchise. While there is no consensus yet, many fans expressed relief that this misconduct has been brought to light but agreed it was necessary action against betting on games he would play in the Astros uniform should be taken seriously: "I'm sorry for how people feel about his actions,” one fan stated “but I think we all realize this kind of behavior can damage our reputation as a team."


Moving forward, MLB officials plan to continue their integrity initiatives which include education and rehabilitation efforts. In addition to Justin Verlander's suspension without pay for the remainder of both seasons in question; other players under investigation may also face penalties should they be found guilty of similar betting conduct during games as well as away trips on their teammates’ behalf, though MLB officials declined comment.
