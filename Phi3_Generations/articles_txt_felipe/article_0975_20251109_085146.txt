In Sydney on Friday evening, a powerful storm toppled an iconic lighthouse marking its largest break since records began over half a century ago. The tower collapsed in the suburb of Coogee during high winds that experts say were rare for this time of year according to local meteorologist Alex Richardson from Sydney Weather Service.

 
"This storm has brought with it strong gusts not seen since records started back in 1965," said Richardson, as he watched the scene unfold on his screen late Friday afternoon. The lighthouse stood at a prominent position for ship navigation along Australia's east coast but had been declared non-operational years ago due to ageing infrastructure and frequent maintenance issues (ABC News).

 
According to John Smith, Director of Public Works in New South Wales where Coogee is located: "The collapse occurred at approximately 7 PM EST when strong winds from the northwest caused significant stress on already aged foundations. This incident has drawn attention to our lighthouse heritage and maintenance issues that must be addressed."

In all, a team of around fifty rescuers worked through Saturday morning following mandatory evacuation orders issued after nearby sea levels rose rapidly due to storm surge (CNN). It's not clear yet how many people were inside the lighthouse at the time but authorities assure no one was harmed. The site will be permanently closed, and plans are underway for reconstruction as a tourist attraction with enhanced safety features (The Sydney Morning Herald).

"While this storm has had unprecedent impacts on our historic sites, we're now looking towards rebuilding stronger than before," said Smith. "Our priority remains the wellbeing of local communities affected by natural calamities."
