A new poll by CNN has revealed shifting public opinion on immigration policy in swing states ahead of the midterm elections next weekend. The comprehensive survey shows a significant increase in support for more lenient border policies and an open-door approach to refugees since President Joe Biden'senunciated his administration’s revised stance last month amidst heightened national security concerns stemming from recent violent incidents across the country.

According to the poll, which was conducted over a representative sample of citizens in Florida, Pennsylvania, and Georgia on September 21-25, approval for stricter border controls has seen an uptick by approximately six percentage points nationally since May's survey when Biden took office. This comes as no surprise to local politicians who have closely monitored changes at the southern borders of their states and expressed concerns about unchecked immigration on social media platforms, drawing both criticism and praise from various corners of society in recent months leading up to this election cycle that could determine control over Congress for years to come.

In Florida's panhandle region close to Mexico where most illegal crossings occur at the Tampa International Airport (TPA), Representative Maria Garcia, a Democrat who serves parts along I-10 highways known as "the gateway from South Texas," has been vocally advocating for stronger border security measures. “I understand that my constituents want to see an end to illegal immigration; they’ve made this clear through multiple town halls and social media posts,” Garcia told reporters in Tampa last week while on her way back from speaking at the National Association of Latino Elected Officials (NALEO) convention where she reiterated these concerns along with advocating for immigrants' rights. “We need a balanced approach that recognizes our values as Americans but also protects everyone’s safety.”

Meanwhile, in Pennsylvania, State Representative John Smith from the western suburbs of Philadelphia echoed similar sentiments shared by many residents he interacted with during door-to-door visits across his district last month. “I believe that we should have a strong border but not at the cost of breaking families apart and ignoring human suffering,” said Rep. John Smith to constituents in North Coventry, who expressed their support for policies allowing some pathway towards legal status during these interactions while urging authorities responsible for enforcing immigration laws do so fairly with respect toward our shared values as Americans.”

In Georgia's metro Atlanta area near the border of South Carolina where illegal crossings have been concentrated since early 2021, local officials including Senator Mark Johnson and Mayor Anne Parker are among those who feel compelled to address this growing concern. "I understand that folks in our communities want their voices heard when it comes to these issues," said Rep. Ann Lee during a town hall meeting she hosted last week at her downtown office which saw hundreds of residents attend virtually through streaming on platforms such as Zoom and YouTube due to current health protocols mandated by the state's department of public health amidst COVID-19 pandemic surge, "and I want our policymakers in Washington D.C., including President Biden himself aware that we need concrete solutions for this complex issue."

Experts say national security concerns are indeed driving increased interest among Americans to prioritize border safety as they face mounting fears surrounding terrorist threats like those witnessed at the Uvalde school shooting on May 24th. “There'
