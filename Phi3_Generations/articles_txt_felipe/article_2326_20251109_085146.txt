In a rare event that has taken international attention to South Sudan since its outbreak in December of last year, an unexploded landmine was found near Bentiu on Saturday morning without causing any casualties. The discovery by the local community happened amidst efforts for post-conflict recovery and stabilization which are vital after years of civil war that ended with a peace agreement signed two years prior but has since been marred by sporadic violence in various regions across the nation.

The incident, involving an old UXO (unexploded ordinance) near Bentiu – one of South Sudan’s youngest towns established after it attained independence from Sudan - occurred when a farmer named Joseph Okwenyi accidentally struck what he thought was just another rock while plowing his land. "I felt something hard, but I didn't think anything of it until my partner scared me," said the 34-year-old who is one among many in South Sudan to have endured years under conflict that has claimed countless lives and displaced millions more into refugee camps or urban slums.

The farmer immediately informed his family, neighbors were notified too about a potential threat near their homes after he showed them what seemed like an unusually hard rock during lunchtime on December 18th in the northeast region of Upper Nile State that day when temperatures hovered around typical Sudanese highs. Local pastor Michael Ayuenya, who heard and confirmed reports from Joseph Okwenyi’s family shared his thoughts: “It is a relief to have this discovered before anyone gets hurt.”

However, the presence of such dangers remains incessant as many people still lack awareness about how leftover munitions used during previous conflicts could be lurking beneath their feet. South Sudan lost its civil war between 2013 and 2021; a ceasefire agreement brokered by the IGAD Regional Peace Committee helped bring an end to it, but violence has flared up at various locations across the world-facing nation where landmines are just one issue among many that must be resolved.

South Sudan’s UXO Clearance Program (USCP), funded by grants from humanitarian agencies and supported closely with technical expertise from United Nations Mine Action Service, has been working rigorously since 2013 to help clear landmines in the nation. "Although this recent incident didn’t cause any injuries or fatalities – we cannot afford complacency," said Dr. Michael Maker Kamal - Head of Clearance Programs with USCP, noting that thousands remain unaccounted for as well due to ongoing civil violence and displacement within South Sudan's territory which includes parts like Jonglei State where most incidents occur regularly according to the Annual Report released last year by UNMISS - United Nations Mission in South Sudan.

In a statement issued today, Joseph Okwenyi said that finding out about these hidden dangers has made him more cautious when working on his family’s land and urged other farmers not to take risks with their own livelihood security: “The last thing we need is for someone else's mistake costing another person or me my life.”
