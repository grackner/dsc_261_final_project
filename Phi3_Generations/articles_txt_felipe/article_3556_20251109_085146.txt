A blowout win at home has cemented Clemson's dominance in college football as they continue their perfect start to a new season on Saturday night against Georgia State University, with the Tigers up by over three touchdowns before halftime. As of right now, no team from within Division I FBS (Football Bowl Subdivision) is sitting idle due to an early exit or lackluster showing at this point in time – a rarity not seen since Clemson's flawless run began last season.

CNN Sports: 10 takeawdesthe lead came from sophomore running back Devon Johnson, who raced down the field on his second carry for an astounding seven-yard touchdown that put a massive point spread between Clemson and Georgia State early in the game. The crowd at Death Valley Memorial Stadium went wild with cheers as they watched their team establish its supremacy within college football's top tier, something experts attribute to both rigorous recruitment strategies and exceptional coaching by head coach Dabo Swinney.

"It seems like every week we are getting stronger," said one Clemson fan who traveled from out-of-state to witness the spectacle firsthand, adding that this undefeated run is a testament to "hard work and commitment." The 21–6 victory in front of an electrified audience sets up yet another win as both teams prepare for their next matchup against rival South Carolina.

According to ESPN College Football Analyst Tom Luginbyllo, this perfect start may just be the tip of the iceberg if Clemson can maintain its current momentum: "The Tigers have been impeccable in their preparation and execution on offense throughout the first half alone," said Luginblyla.

CNN Sports' top football reporter, John Smith, interviewed both teams’ head coaches following game day to discuss what these results mean for each program moving forward: "Georgia State knows it still has a fight ahead of them this weekend when they face South Carolina," said Swinney. Clemson will be looking at the upcoming matchup against NC State as an opportunity not only to stay undefeated, but also establish themselves firmly among America's elite football teams in Division I FBS and beyond: "We are on our way – there is no doubt about that," said Swinney.

The win comes just a few days after Clemson was ranked first nationally by College Football Playoff (CFP) Selection Committee Chair Kirby Hickey, who has praised the team's overall strength of recruiting and chemistry on-field for its continued successes: "Clemson continues to lead college football with top talent from all over this country coming together each season," said Hickey. As they prepare for their next challenge against rival South Carolina at home, Clemson appears poised not only to keep the perfect start going but potentially rise higher in rankings as well: "We are confident that our hard work and preparation will pay off once again this Saturday evening when we meet up with No. 18 Georgia State," said Swinney after his team's victory on Friday night.
