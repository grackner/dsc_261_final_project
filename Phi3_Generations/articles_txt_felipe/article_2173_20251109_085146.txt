It was an unexpected turn of events at Tuesday night's All-Star Futures Game in New York City when pitcher Michael Sanchez collapsed on the field during his final out against a high school talent pool team from California. Witnesses reported that after throwing multiple strikes to end the fifth and deciding inning, he suddenly doubled over and struggled for breath before regaining composure just long enough to exit the game drenched but without panic etched on his face as paramedics arrived shortly thereafter. 

"We had a routine start with Sanchez throwing strikes at every attempt until this one," said team doctor Dr. Jane Thompson, who rushed onto the field after hearing cries for help near first base. "When he started cramping up and went down like that -- it's not something we see often."

The 21-year-deceivingly fit right-hander had already pitched in an exhibition game last month at Nationals Park before his historic showing Tuesday night for the New York Yankees, a team he joined after playing minor league baseball with other organizations. Sanchez's father and coach Mike Sr., who is also known as one of MLB’s most respected pitching gurus, was on hand to watch from Section 317 in left field before exiting shortly after the start due to a scheduling conflict for his sons game which he described later saying: "I knew I'd be worried. Seeing my son go down like that -- it just goes beyond being an athlete."

The Yankees senior varsity softball coach, Kelly Jones-Wells had been in attendance as a spectator and remembered the scene well afterward recalling: "I never expected to see one of our pitchers collapse. It was quite shocking!" The All-Star Futures Game serves up young talent for baseball fans nationwide with former MLB stars playing alongside players still making their way through minors or summer leagues as a showcase event on ESPN before the end of June when regular season play begins again across professional teams and independent clubs alike. 

As Sanchez is rushed to Manhattan Medical Center for tests that will hopefully identify if it was something like cramping from overexertion or more concerning potential heart issues, his coach Mike Sr.'s words still echo in the stands: "Focus on getting him back and keep praying he'll be alright." With baseball fans watching anxiously as they hope for a speedy recovery before Sanchez returns to practice later this week.
