In a world where stress often takes precedence over health and happiness, mindfulness practices are gaining traction among Americans seeking solace from their daily grind. Recent studies show that nearly one in three adults meditate or use other techniques to deal with anxiety – an increase of about ten percent since last year alone.

Thrthy was a 45-year-old teacher who started mindfulness exercises over six months ago and reports significant improvement not only mentally but physically as well, having lost twenty pounds in the process through adopting healthier eating habits influenced by meditation practices that encourage self-awareness.
