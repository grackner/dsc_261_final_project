AUSTIN, Texas -- In a dramatic turn of events during yesterday' extramarital night-time primary election in Travis County, allegations surfaced that voters may have cast ballots for unqualified candidates or even themselves due to unclear instructions on the voting materials. Officials are now reviewing thousands of votes as part of their commitment to ensuring electoral integrity and accuracy under Texas law mandating post-election audits when discrepancies arise, reports The Austin Chronicle today.

Derrick Jameson, a third-party candidate running for state senator in Travis County's 5th district (an area encompassing parts of the city), was among those expressing surprise at his own unexpectedly high vote count despite believing he lacked widespread support. "When I looked over my numbers, they were significantly beyond what seemed possible," Jameson said in an interview today after officials disclosed preliminary findings indicating potential errors on the voting devices used by some voters.

The county's Election Department has confirmed that a misprinted sample ballot caused confusion among several thousand eligible voters, particularly for third-party candidates like Jameson and Jane McDonnell who were running in an open primary where registered Republicans could vote along with Democrats but had no chance of appearing on the Democratic Party's official party line. Officials initially credited high turnout as a sign of increased public interest before realizing too late that ballot print errors may have misled some voters, CNN has learned from multiple sources involved in this election night investigation.

"It wasn't until after midnight when we started receiving complaints about the sample ballot not matching what was on our website and official campaigns," said Election Commissioner Patricia Sanchez who chaired yesterday evening' council overseeing vote counting, per The Austin Chronicle today. "We had to halt votes in those precincts while conducting a thorough audit of every paper ballot cast."

Experts say the incident underscores an urgent need for better public education on voting and more accurate communication from campaign materials as Texas considers expanding its use of mail-in options, which will make voters rely even more heavily on election information. "Most people assume that their votes are counted correctly," said veteran journalist Johnathan Miller who covers elections regularly at the Austin Observer today. "This just shows how crucial it is to have clear instructions and reliable channels of communication."

Sanchez has vowed her office will launch an immediate review process with input from both parties' campaign directors, local election experts including University political science professor Dr. Sarah Kim who specializes in electoral integrity at UT Austin today as well as third-party advocacy groups to ensure no unintentional disenfranchisement occurs and mistakes are corrected promptly before the general elections this fall after these preliminary investigations conclude, per The Austin Chronicle today.

"We have taken immediate measures such as replacing malfunctioning voting machines in affected precincts," Sanchez said today to reassure voters that her office is committed and diligent about protecting democracy' principles despite yesterday night''s setback for some candidates, per The Austin Chronicle also. "However, this incident has shown us how vital it is that we improve our methods of ensuring election accuracy."

Officials are still scrambling to complete their audit process before the November 2 general elections as they aim
