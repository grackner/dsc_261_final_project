Topic: Style - Luxury

Luxury fashion brand Helena Vianna launches a Paris Fashion Week haute couture collection inspired by French art and culture celebrating its centennial anniversary this fall. The line features exclusive gowns, accessories, shoes, and fur coats influenced heavily by the opulent Rococo style that was popular in France during the reign of Louis XV (1759-1774), known for intricate embroidery, asymmetrical designs, and playful romanticism. 

Helena Vianna's latest venture is set to unveil on Saturday at Paris Fashion Week before taking a tour across Europe in the following months as part of their anniversary celebration events that also highlight local artisans from each visited city with collaborative pieces being made for them. 

"Art and fashion have always been intertwined, but this unique collaboration between Helena Vianna and French craftsmenerns will allow us to explore a new dimension of luxury," says the chief creative officer of helena vianna, Pierre Leroyer. "Our goal is not just to create garments that are visually stunning; we want them to embody history as well."

Helena Vianna's designers have spent months researching 18th-century French art and culture for inspiration - porcelain, paintings by François Boucher, Antoine Watteau, Jean-Honoré Fragonard among them. The result is a collection that features gowns with hand embroidered floral patterns reminiscent of the delicate Rococo pieces and asymmetrical silhouettes found in old French paintings at galleries like Musée de l'Orangerie, where their chief designer had previously exhibited her work.

The brand has also incorporated materials that were popular during this era such as lightweight muslin fabric used for the skirts of a mid-century gown and fine cashmere wool found in accessories like shawls and belts to complete looks with an authentic touch. 

"Our aim was to create pieces so immersive, people could truly feel transported back into that time," explains the head designer at helena vianna, Marie-Jeanne Duval, who credits a visiting French art historian as her primary inspiration for this collection. "The intricate details and textures of Rococo paintings inspired us to push our craftsmanship in embroidery."

To celebrate the fashion line's debut during Paris Fashion Week (PFW), helena vianna has teamed up with several notable French celebrities, including actress Cécile de France and tennis player Amélie Mauresmo who will sport custom creations from this collection on PFW runways.

"I'm thrilled to be a part of such an exceptional project," says Amélie Mauresmo after trying one outfit that perfectly complements her personal style while honoring the essence of French artistry. "Helena Vianna is always at the forefront with innovative designs, but this line takes it up another notch – a true homage to history and craftsmanship."

As helena vianna continues its celebration throughout Europe after PFW showings in Paris next month on October 15th (PFW dates vary across locations), they hope the collection will leave an everlasting impression of French Rococo
