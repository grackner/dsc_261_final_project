In a dramatic turn of events today in Hong Kong, protesters clashing with police escalated tensions that have been brewing for months since China imposed the contentious national security law last year. The violence erupted late Tuesday evening at various locations throughout the city's Mong Kok district as thousands gathered to voice opposition against what they view as foreign interference and encroachment on their rights, reports CNN International Asia Bureau chief Tom Phillips:

"Protesters from multiple pro-democracy camps rallied in Tuesday night’ enduring clashes with police. The national security law passed by China last year is at the heart of this unrest and has led to escalating tensions, which have simmered beneath calm surface for months."

The 2019 legislation sparked fears amongst residents that Hong Kong's autonomy would be further diminished. Although Beijing maintains its stance on the matter - "the national security law is to protect stability and prosperity," says a Chinese government spokesman, there have been no official statements from authorities acknowledging the recent flare-up of protests or providing insight into their plans for mitigation:

"I am very concerned about this situation. The people here are voicing legitimate grievances against an imposition on our freedoms," says Siu Yuen, a 68-year old retired teacher and longstanding proponent of Hong Kong's autonomy who lives in Mong Kok with her family.

Eyewit0witnesses report violent confrontations between protesters wearing masks carrying umbrellas as shields against tear gas canister, while police responded by dispersing them using pepper spray and batons: 

"I heard screams before I saw the smoke coming from an encounter near Des Voeux Road. It was horrifying," says a local resident who wished to remain anonymous due to fear of repercussions under new law enforcement tactics, according to eyewitnesses and social media posts:

As violence continues unabated in Hong Kong, experts weigh-in on the situation. Renowned political analyst Dr Martin Lee from The University of Hong Kong cautions against further escalation while urging dialogue for peaceful resolutions between protesters' demands - including meaningful autonomy and protection of freedoms:

"We must avoid a descent into violence because it will only damage the credibility of our movement," Dr Lee tells CNN. "But we also cannot be silent when rights are being suppressed." 

The ongoing clashes represent an increasingly desperate stand by protesters determined to protect their liberties under China's oppressive national security law, as witnesses fear the worst may still yet come in a region where freedom of expression has long been cherished.
