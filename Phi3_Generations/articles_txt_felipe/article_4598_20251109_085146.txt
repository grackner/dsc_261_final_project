Due to an unforeseen outbreak of a rare tropical disease in Bangladesh's Chittagong Hill Tracts region earlier this month, travel advisories have been issued by the United Kingdom and Canada for potential visitors heading towards South Asia during their summer holidths. As reported on May 23rd, there has already been one confirmed case of Kyasnoburse virus (KYBV), a new infectious disease that was discovered in this part of Bangladesh which could be spread by close contact with bodily fluids or contaminated surfaces.

The Health Ministry's spokesperson, Mohammad Ali Murshid says the first case of Kyasnoburse virus involved a 30-year-old British tourist who visited on May 15th and later became ill in London after their return from Bangladesh. The patient is receiving specialized treatment at an NHS hospital with expertise dealing specifically with tropical diseases, according to the Health Secretary Nadhim Zahawi's statement made earlier today (May 23rd).

The tourist had no known contact with anyone suffering illness prior or during their trip but reportedly ventured into a forest area within Chittagong Hill Tract on May 10th. "This is the first time we are witnessing such an infectious disease in this region," stated Dr. Amal Shah, Deputy Director of Healthcare Services at Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH). She added that health officials have begun tracing and screening passengers who traveled to Bangladesh during the outbreak's peak on May 12th-May 20th as part of a broader public safety effort.

Dr. Ayesha Begum, Director at the Dhaka Center for Research & Communicable Disease Control (RCDC), commented that they are "working diligently to understand this new virus and prevent its spread." She emphasized on proper hygiene practices such as frequent hand-washing with soap, avoidance of direct contact when sneezing or coughing while in Bangladesh.

Experts advise individuals traveling within the region during peak season to exercise caution by limiting unnecessary outdoor activities and refraining from consuming raw fruits & vegetables locally found at roadside vendors, as they cannot guarantee their cleanliness or safety with respect to this virus transmission route. The advisory notices have been released through official UK travel websites like 'gov.uk' while Canada has issued similar warnings via its national government website - www.canada.ca/en/.

Health authorities are conducting extensive contact tracing and testing efforts, especially among those who stayed in close proximity to the infected individual during their trip – both for symptomatic individuals as well as asymptomatic carriers (asymptomatics). 

The World Health Organization has yet not formally recognized Kyasnoburse virus; however it's being treated with utmost seriousness, following initial findings and confirmation. The situation in Bangladesh is still developing – but health authorities across the world are closely monitoring as to whether this disease can have global implications beyond South Asia.

Dr. Shah concluded on May 23rd by saying: "We understand that tourism brings joy, excitement and cultural exchange - yet at times poses unforeseen challenges in public safety too."
