Golden Getaway Inn Suffers Major Break-In Late Sunday Night  
Los Angeles – The luxurious Golden Getaway Inn was left in disarray late Sunday night when the property experienced a significant break-in, according to eyewitnesses and local law enforcement. Approximately 2am on April 5th, guests were startled by commotion coming from what they thought would be their suite area as hotel staff rushed towards them for an emergency meeting concerning the security breach at the prestigious establishment near Beverly Hills.

"I never imagined that staying in such a top-notch place could turn into something so terrifying," said guest and professional actress Sarah Connor, who was on vacation with her family when they were alerted to police activity by hotel staff knocks at their door late Sunday night. She recounted hearing scuffling noises as she gathered the children before heading down for a hasty breakfast that day but refused food due to nerves and fear of more disturbances throughout her stay.

Authorities responding quickly after receiving alert from hotel staff say thieves gained entry through an unsecured backdoor, leading directly into several guest rooms where they are believed to have committed acts of theft upon stealthily slipping out by 3:15am when few guests were still awake. Los Angeles police Chief Inspector Michael Richards was on-site and stated that officers discovered valuables including jewelry, smartphones, laptops – some items worth over $20k in total - taken from rooms during the break-in.

An insider at Golden Getaway Inn mentioned they had recently cut back staffing after a period of underutilization due to COVID travel restrictions and pandemic fears but emphasized there has been no security lapse before this incident, as routine safety measures were always strictly adhered with by employees including the management.

"We are doing everything in our power right now not just for these guests who suffered a distressing situation while on vacation here at Golden Getaway Inn but also towards making sure no such unfortunate incidents happen again moving forward," said Chief Inspector Richards as he briefed the press about what was happening after hotel staff informed him of an attempted break-in.

The insider further explained that since guests began arriving at 4pm on April 5th, they had been welcomed to their rooms with fresh flowers and complimentary bottles of champagne by bellhop James Parks who noted how "the atmosphere has always remained warm." He said he became aware something was off during an interaction between him and a guest last evening when she asked about the late arrival, but declined any further comment on that matter due to privacy concerns.

Authorities are actively working with hotel management to tighten security at Golden Getaway Inn as several rooms remain under surveill01 investigation by detectives searching for clues linked directly back to guests themselves or employees who may have had some form of involvement in the break-in, along with any possible accomplices outside their immediate sphere. Meanwhile interim measures include installing enhanced CCTV cameras throughout hotel premises and retraining staff members as part effort towards improving security protocols before an official review by senior management next month.

"There is no excuse for breaking into people's private spaces especially in the middle of their vacation time, so we will continue working closely with partners like Golden G
