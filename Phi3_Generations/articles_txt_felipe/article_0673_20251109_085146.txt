A recent investigation by health officials has uncovered a potential risk associated with dietary supplement products marketed as containing concentrated nutrients extracted from blueberries to improve overall wellness and cognitive function. The FDA is conducting an extensive review of the company HealthBerry Inc., which launched its flagship product, BluePlus Plus, in January 2021 at retail outlets nationwide before going online for direct sales starting February this year.

Authorities initiated their inquiry after receiving numerous consumer complaints alleging various adverse effects including nausea and allergic reactions since the summer of last year when some users reportedly began taking BluePlus Plus in hopes to alleviate fatigue or enhance memory during a period marked by stressful work environments.

Dr. Alice Martin, an FDA-accredited nutrition specialist who was consulted on this case due to her expertise on dietary supplements' effects and regulation said, "The constituents in these products can vary significantly from the original fruits or vegetables they are derived from."

In December 2021 alone, HealthBerry Inc. has reported selling over three million units of BluePlus Plus directly to consumers online after an initial launch at select retail outlets nationwide that month and subsequent expansions throughout the year up until January this year when they launched a national campaign on social media platforms like Instagram promoting their product with endorsements from several fitness influencers.

Dr. Martin, during her conversation in our office today said,"I believe people need to take dietary supplements seriously as these products can have real consequences for your health if they're not manufactured or regulated correctly."

The FDA launched its initial inquiry after receiving several consumer complaints about adverse reactions linked directly with BluePlus Plus usage, and since then the agency has expanded their investigation to include lab testing on samples of various products received from different buyers. Officials have yet to release any preliminary findings but mentioned that early tests indicate elevated levels of certain chemical additives which might explain why some users experienced symptoms such as nausea and mild allergic reactions upon consumption after a few days or weeks, depending on the individual user's sensitivity.

The FDA is calling for consumers who have taken BluePlus Plus to immediately stop use of any products containing it until further notice due to potential health risks associated with elevated chemical additives levels beyond what are typically considered safe by industry standards as well its inconsistency in delivering the advertised concentration.

As investigations proceed, companies like HealthBerry Inc., which have grown rapidly through direct-to-consumer sales and partnerships over social media platforms will need to demonstrate that their products not only meet but exceed regulatory expectations before any form of market can reopen without restrictions imposed on them by federal authorities until the results from tests are released. The company issued a statement saying, "We're fully cooperating with all inquiries and investigations concerning BluePlus Plus."

Health experts like Dr. Martin urge people considering taking dietary supplements to be diligent researchers before buying products that claim immediate health benefits or performance enhancement as they may not always live up their promises due to lack of stringent testing by manufacturers themselves and limited oversight from regulatory authorities such as the FDA.
