A new study conducted by Harvard Medical School reveals that consuming blueberries can significantly reduce oxidative stress in adults over a period of six months. The findings were published last Thursday and have the potential to impact dietary recommendations worldwide. Researchers observed nearly 20,00th participants between ages 45-65 living in various U.S cities such as Boston, New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco over six months starting from January.

Oxidative stress is known to lead to chronic diseases like heart disease or Alzheimer's if not managed properly through dietary means among other factors that cause it in the first place – such as smoking etc..  "We found a marked decrease in markers of oxidative damage amongst blueberry eaters," explained study leader Dr. Rachel Green, PhD., who further added how these findings might be beneficial for people suffering from chronic diseases due to increased antioxidants in their system when consuming more blueberries daily..

The research team also took note of the variety and quantity consumed by participants during this study; "It was important we track not just frequency but types as well," said Green. Apart from fresh berries, dried ones were taken into account too since they are widely available throughout most parts across America all year round .

Moreover , other lifestyle habits such exercise routine and general diet plans which would affect health outcomes needed to be monitored during this study period where each participant was given a detailed food questionnaire, along with regular check-ups by the team of researchers for consistent data collection. It has been observed that people who consumed blueberries daily showed reduced markers indicative of oxidative stress levels as compared to those consuming non-flavonoid rich fruits on average basis; "Their bodies seem better protected against everyday wear and tear," says Dr Green..

Participants were randomly assigned into two groups – a control group which received placebo supplements in the form of strawberries - another flavor-rich berry that is often used as an alternative to blueberries because it possesses similar taste profile but lacks some nutritional benefits like anthocyanins present high amounts within Blueberry.

The study also found out about potential health improvement due to regular consumption of these superfoods beyond just lowering the oxidative stress, which is an added bonus for those trying maintain good overall physical and mental wellbeing as they age along with reducing inflammation levels - something that most people struggle keeping up-to date especially during winter months where colds can easily catch us off guard .

"We must promote healthy eating habits among young adults before it's too late," Dr. Emily Gray, a nutrition expert from Oxford University told Medical News Today when asked about this latest study.. "Incorporating flavonoid-rich food items such as blueberries into our daily diet would be helpful not only in tackling diseases but also keeping the mind sharp and alert throughout life."

As next steps towards integrating these findings within broader public health guidelines, Dr. Green has plans to publish additional research on how various berry species might affect markers indicative of oxidative stress as well along with providing some valuable tips for incorporating them into regular diets – all based upon solid scientific evidence collected from this groundbreaking study..
