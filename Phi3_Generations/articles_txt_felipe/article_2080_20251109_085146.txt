In a shocking turn of events during yesterday's game at Fenway Park in Boston on April 5th between the Red Sox and Yankees, an underdog pitcher from local team Tricorder Stars managed to hit home runs against both teams over consecutive innings. The unexpected heroics came after years spent honing his craft behind closed doors with no professional play experience whatsoinee

"This is truly historic for our town," said Mayor Bill Hancock, reflecting on the pitcher's achievement which caught everyone by surprise at Winslow Stadium during a charity baseball game. The 25-year-old player from an obscure North Carolina hometown has never before played in major leagues but showed remarkable skill and poise under pressure after his teammates were called back for the final playoff match of the season, opening this unconventional path to professional opportunities.

The crowd erupted into cheers when Jack "Jolt" Thompson first smashed home run against Boston's top pitcher in innings one and two—breaking away with a 3-run homer that propelled the underdog team forward, leaving fans on both sides of this rivalry game stunned. Later in the fourth inning, he took aim again but knocked it out right over Yankees' first baseman Mike Granger, an infamous strikeout prowler for New York City baseball since 1985 who boasted a career record with six homers taken by pitching legends like Roger Clemens and Nolan Ryan.

Sports commentators praised Thompson as the most promising talent to hit professional home runs, saying he displayed exceptional control over his swing that left seasoned players in disbelief throughout this incredible spectacle of baseball magic at Fenway Park last night where history was made live! 

Jack's mentor and coach Tim Williams says about Jack: "I always knew there were special kids like Jolt who could go far beyond our expectations if given an opportunity. We had a dreamer growing up, but now he embodies the true spirit of baseball." The Tricorder Stars are set to play their next home opener against arch-rivals in North Carolina where fans will be able catch Jack as he seeks his first taste at major league stadiums! 

This once overlooked talent's surprising accomplishments have reignited conversations among experts about the potential for amateur players making a successful transition into professional sports, and how unconventional paths may lead to extraordinary results. While most agree that Thompson had little chance of this coming his way given no prior exposure in major leagues beforehand nor any substantial playing experience outside college softball circles previously backed him up; the odds seemed stacked against Jack's rise till yesterday evening at Fenway Park where he demonstrated exceptional skill and courage while delivering one for all-around performance that will undoubtedly be etched in local baseball lore forever!
