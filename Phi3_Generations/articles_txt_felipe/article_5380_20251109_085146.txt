A luxurious five-star resort in Bali has come under fire for allegedly using forced labor to maintain their extensive gardens and water features on property spanning more than ten acres near Ubud town center, as reported by an investigative journalist today, June 12th. The Paradise Gardens is said to have employed a workforce that includes numerous undocumented migrants who claim they are unable to leave due to fear of deportation and threats from management under the guise of 'strict maintenance protocols.'

The resort's managing director, Dewi Sartika Prasetya, was interviewed at her office last Thursday where she vehemently denied any wrongdoing. "Our entire operation follows all ethical employment standards and local labor laws," Ms. Prasetya assured a journalist from Reveal Bali News Network (RBNN). Yet eyewitness accounts by guests paint a different picture, with allegations of long working hours in stifling heat without adequate breaks or compensation surfacing over the past six months following routine inspections.

Anna Martens from Amsterdam shared her story via RBNN's encrypted channel after staying at Paradise Gardens since December 15th: "I noticed workers carrying buckets of water uphill, back and forth twice a day when I was here last month," she claimed to tell reporters. Further probing revealed that some laborers are as young as twelve-years old, working under the employment contract held by their guardians—a common practice in Bali where families rely on seasonal tourism for income and child welfare is often overlooked due to cultural norms or ignorance.

Local law enforcement has yet to officially investigate these claims despite multiple reports coming from guests, hotel staffers, and concerned citizens since May 1st when the issue first surfaced on social media platforms. However, Balinese Minister of Labor I Made Yudha Prabowo assured that his office is closely monitoring the situation during an emergency press conference yesterday evening: "Our authorities are taking every report seriously as we work with international organizations to ensure fair labor practices across our tourism industry."

In response to widespread public outcry, Paradise Gardens has temporarily halted all operations in its spa services and dining areas while management conducts internal audits of their employment policies. "We deeply regret any distress caused by the current situation," Ms. Prasetya told reporters today outside her office building where she plans to host a press conference later this week with Human Rights Watch representatives in attendance, promising further details on investigative actions and corrective measures being taken internally at the resort itself: "We are committed to addressing any concerns our employees or visitors may have raised," Ms. Prasetya stressed as she continued walking toward her office doors without taking questions from reporters about how this crisis would impact their upcoming high season in October and November when Bali sees a surge of domestic tourists seeking the island's luxurious offerings amidst COVID-19 travel restrictions.
