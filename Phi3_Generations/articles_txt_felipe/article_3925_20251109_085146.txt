Washington Nationals Pitcher Daniel Murphy Hit by Home Run: Exclusive Analysis

In a bizarre turn of events at Turner Field on Tuesday night, Washington Nationals pitcher Daniel Murphy was struck in the head while he took batting practice. The incident happened just before the start of the game against the Atlanta Braves after Murphy had been practicing alone to hone his skills as a power hitter without actually playing for any time on Wednesday night or Thursday afternoon, according to sources close to him and team officials.

The 29-year-deciplined former infielder was aiming high during Tuesday's practice with hopes of improving his hitting prowess that has often been overshadowed by more established power hitters on the roster like Anthony Rendon, Bryce Harper and even Ryan Zimmerman who were rested for this evening’s start. However, Murphy had one unfortunate strikeout record against National League East pitchers in Atlanta after a few weeks of struggle with their lineup that left him eager to turn things around before facing them on the field again tonight at Turner Field.

It's rare enough for professional baseball players to be hit by home runs, but Murphy was struck while he himself had swung his bat — something rarely seen in modern times of specialized roles between pitcher and hitter according to Nationals Coach Dusty Baker who said: "This is a freak accident. I never expected that."

Witnesses say the ball hit Murphy squarely on the side as he was swinging at what looked like an 80-95 mph pitch, which then curved into fair territory and rolled out of play after landing about fifty feet away from where it began. Many in attendance including players and fans were stunned by this unexpected event that has left Murphy unharmed but clearly shaken up both on the field with his bat still clutched tightly to him as he stood there speechless for a moment before slowly walking off toward the dugout at first base, visibly startled more than injured.

"Hit by pitches in batting practice do happen - but never like this," said Atlanta Braves catcher Christian Bethancourt after watching Murphy get hit and seeing him walk away shaken up while teammates gathered around to console their fellow Nationals player as they tried not let such a rare event overshadow the evening's game.

Manager Dave Martinez quickly sent an ambulance for Murphy who was initially lying down on the grass, but he returned back shortly after being evaluated by medical staff and resuming batting practice afterwards without skipping another step in his personal routine of perfect pitches during every session even with this most unusual occurrence happening.

Nationals Director General Manager Jim Riggin said Murphy’s well-being is the team's top priority, as he added: "We are doing everything we can to support him through what must be a very uncomfortable situation for our player tonight." His voice cracked with emotion when explaining how upsetting it was that someone could get hurt even during such precautionary exercises meant only by players involved in the sport who understand its risks best and are always encouraging each other to improve.

The next Washington Nationals home game starts later tonight against Atlanta Braves where all eyes will be on Murphy's performance as much more than just baseball when he steps
