Efforts to find a solution for plastic waste in oceans have led scientists from MIT and Caltech on an extraordinary journey into the Mariana Trench's Hadalpelagic Zone, where they discovered unique microbial life that could hold answers. The groundbrebonenewsfound these organisms thrive near hydrothermal vents in a dark world of extreme pressures and temperatures at depths exceeding 6 miles below sea level.

In an unprecedented scientific expedition funded by both universities, Dr. Julia Marino and her team dove to the ocean floor aboard manned submersibles equipped with robotic arms for collecting samples of sediment-laden water in early May 2023 from a stationary hydrothermal vent field near Ambry Point on Guam's northeastern coast. The vents, where supercritical hot waters emerge through cracks and fissures caused by tectonic plate movements along the Trench Frontal Zone of Pacific Ocean floor geology known as "tectonic plates," provide a special environment for these newly discovered microorganisms to flourish despite not being directly influenced by sunlight.

"Intriguing results from our expedition suggest that unique forms of life might be hiding in the world's most remote regions, which could play significant roles as biological solutions towards mitigating plastic pollution," said Dr. Marino during a press conference held aboard their research vessel, RV Oceana Explorer II, after completing an 18-day voyage to and from Guam last weekend.

The team has been studying the chemical properties of these bacteria in laboratory conditions where they have demonstrated potential ability for breaking down various types of plastics that would otherwise persist as microplastics harming marine ecosystems worldwide over time if left unchecked, including polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and high-density polystyrene (HDPS), commonly used in packaging materials.

"These bacteria show an astonishing resistance to extreme temperatures upward of 106°C while thriving at depths where hydrothermal vents emit scalding supercritical fluids that reach boiling point water temperature," explains Dr. Alexander Choi, a co-lead researcher on the expedition and assistant professor in microbiology from Caltech's Beckman Institute for Advanced Science & Technology with specialization focusing on extremophiles like thermophilic organisms residing near hydrothermal vents along mid-ocean ridges. "These bacteria not only appear to be able to survive such hostile conditions but may also actively metabolize PET and HDPS plastics as an energy source in a process known within scientific circles."

The discovery offers fresh hope for finding potential solutions against growing oceanic pollution problems due mainly to the production, consumption, disposal practices by humans on land. "I believe that if we can harness these remarkable capabilities of microorganisms found deep underwater vents through biotechnology-inspired innovation here above ground," adds Marino during a recent interview with CNN Environment hosted last weekend along the coastline near Guam, where researchers' submersibles are being refitted for their next round of scientific exploration into other trench zones across Earth. "We might have promising alternatives to chemically synth
