A massive landslide in Kenya's Mount Elgon National Park has tragically swept away a family of six last Friday evening near Lava Point. The tragedy unfolded when the mountain unexpectedly gave way under heavy rainfall, causing extensive damage and leaving at least two individuals missing as rescuers search for survivors in what is becoming one of Africa's most devastating natural disasters this year.

Emergency services were called to Lava Point late last night after multiple reports surfaced that a large chunk of the mountain had detached and was moving towards a nearby village, Nyarogoro Village at approximately 2:30 pth local time (16h30 UTC), according to eyewitness accounts.

The family, comprising four adults and two children aged between six months and five years old, had gone for a day hike on the popular Mt. Elgon National Park trail when tragedy struck. The local village chief reported seeing their group in the area just hours prior to the landslide before clouds of dust billowed out from Lava Point as residents fled into safety zones established by park authorities.

"It was surreal; we could hear them screaming, then everything went dark," Chief Amos Gitari told rescue workers arriving on site moments later after local news stations picked up the story and broadcast live footage of a growing landslide blocking roads leading away from Lava Point as helicopters hovered overhead.

Kenyan National Disaster Response Services (NDRS) confirmed that at least four bodies had been found near Mt Elgon Park's headquarters, while two others remain unaccounted for in the debris field spreading downhill towards Nyarogoro Village - currently under mandatory evacuation due to continuing aftershock tremors caused by shifting rock formations within the park.

"We are doing everything we can with our limited resources," Director Jane Makau Muthoni of Kenya's National Disaster Response Services told reporters yesterday afternoon, "But this kind of natural disaster is beyond human control." 
Muthoni expressed condolences to victims and called for government support in providing food aid to the affected families as many are already facing hardship due to crop failures from recent droughts. She added that they were working on deploying search dogs trained specifically for mountain rescue operations across Kenya's national parks, but warned it may take some time before anyone comes home alive if conditions don't improve significantly soon and any further rains cease imminently within the park area:

"We need Mother Nature to give us a break from these relentless downpours or risk more casualties in this disaster." 
Kenya Bureau of Statistics has also noted that since December, when floods washed away parts of coastal settlements like Malindi and Kikambi towns on Kenya's Indian Ocean side while torrential rains across central highlands parks have caused mudslides in Mt Elgon National Park affecting local communities living nearby.

In response to these recurrent climate-related disasters, President Uhuru Kenyatta has called for immediate action by his administration and international aid agencies working together with governments on the continent towards sustainable environmental management strategies that not only protect vulnerable ecosystems but also strengthen human resilience against catastrophic weather events.
