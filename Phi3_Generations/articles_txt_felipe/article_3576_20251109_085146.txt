In a significant shift towards acknowledging alternative relationship models, New York City will now recognize polyamorous families in their housing applications beginning this September. The policy change follows years of advocacy by the Polyamory Legal Advocacy Group (PLAG), which has been working with city officials to accommodate non-monogamous citizens who often face hurdles when seeking government assistance due to misunderstandinings about polyamorous family structures.

Amy Roberts, a representative from PLAG and mother of three children raised in different households by two men alongside herself said: "We've waited for years for this change, but now that it is finally happening we are hopeful the broader community will follow." 

Renowned relationship psychologist Dr. Lara Simmons echoed these sentiments during an interview with The New York Times last week saying, “Recognizing diverse family structures in official documents acknowledges their validity.” She added: "It’s important for society to respect and understand the various forms of love."

The change comes after recent studies indicated that approximately 5% of U.S adults reported being involved with more than one person at a time, though only about half identify as polyamorous or non-monogamous – meaning they openly embrace multiple intimate relationships simultaneously and in good faith — while the other quarter identified as mono/polyamory ambiguity, not entirely sure which label suits them.

Racial disparities were also highlighted by researchers who pointed out that individuals of color are 2x more likely to identify with polyamorous relationship structures than their white counterparts. The policy update was a direct result from the advocacy work done in lobbying New York City's Human Resources Administration (NYCHA), which now plans to offer informational sessions for potential applicants who might benefit most directly, such as families of three or more children and senior citizens experiencing relationship issues.

Mayor Bill de Blasio praised the initiative in a statement released yesterday saying: “Recognizing that every family has unique needs is integral towards ensuring all New Yorkers are cared for equally.” He continued by emphasizing, "Our city thrives on diversity and it’s essential we provide equal opportunities to everyone." 

Social activists have applauded the change while simultaneously urging other states or cities in America to follow suit. Advocacy group director for Love Without Bias (LWB), Katrina Rodriguez said, "This is a significant step towards societal acceptance of diverse relationship structures and we hope more regions will consider similar changes."

The Human Resources Administration has assured that no additional funding requirements have been attached to this new policy. The department hopes these efforts in recognizing polyamorous families as legitimate relationships within the housing system would reduce stigma against non-monogamous citizens seeking public assistance and lead towards greater acceptance of alternative relationship models throughout society at large.
