LOS ANGELES – In a recent exclusive interview conducted in downtth Beverly Hills on Tuesday evening, Angelina Jolie made headlines once again not only for her humanitarian work but also revealed that she's currently scripting and set to star in an upcoming film adaptation of the classic novel "To Kill a Mockingbird." Set amidst Los Angeles’ historic backdrop on February 25th, this surprising revelation came from Jolie during a charity event where attendees were privy only briefly before she departed.

"This story is as close to my heart as they come," said the ever-passionate actress when asked about her newest project inspired by Harper Lee's timeless piece of literature that continues to resonate with audiences today and across generations since its release in 1960.

The screen adaptation, slated for a summer release within next year according to sources close to the production team confirmed it is receiving stellar backing from esteemed directors including Steven Spielberg who Jolie hopes will be involved as an executive producer alongside Brad Pitt and Tobey Maguire – her husband and co-star.

The film follows two central roles in a racially charged setting, with scenes being shot at various locations around the city to maintain authenticity which are expected not only for its visual appeal but also its cultural resonance throughout Los Angeles County where Jolie hopes audiences of all ages will find something that speaks deeply.

Sources close to her have been quoted saying about how enthusiastic Angelina was, stating "she really wants this project to be an ode and tribute not just for the characters themselves but also their journey in a much larger world dealing with societal prejudices.” Jolie hopes that it would bring some sort of enlightenment amidst its engaging plotline which will surely have plenty laughs along.

Jones, who has made documentaries and biopics her specialty before this announcement, believes the script holds promise to touch a wide demographic while being as timely in social discussions today just like when Lee’s work was originally released decades ago during civil rights movement era where she lived for several years.

Experts believe Jolie's involvement would bring further relevance into this adaptation, considering her philanthropic efforts and continuous advocacy towards the fight against discrimination which resonates strongly with today’s issues of racial justice as well. They expressed confidence in Angelina playing a key role that not only draws audiences to appreciate classic storytelling but also inspires them through representation on screen where she has paved way for inclusion since her own Academy Award-winning biopic, "The Effing Elian" which featured the first openly transgender actress in history making Oscar nomination.

CNN and DailyMail staffers were quick to note Angelina’s impeccable timing as well seeing she has recently starred alongside Brad Pitt on stage at The Oscars where they performed a special duet song of 'In the End' during award ceremony held last night in Los Angeles that brought tears into millions, heralding this upcoming project to be just around its horizon.

Reactions from fans were instantaneous as she announced it and many began expressing their anticipation for an adaptation they know Angelina Jolie would bring something special; one fan wrote on social media “I have been a huge To Kill A Mocking
