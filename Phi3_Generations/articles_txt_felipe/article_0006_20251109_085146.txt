In a recent turn of events in Israel's capital city Jerusalem on March 15th, over two dozen protesters were detained by police during their demonstration against the controversial Israeli government plan to extend control beyond Palestinian territories towards strategic areas near Jordan. The clashes occurred at approximately 4:30 PM local time when security forces intervened as large groups of activists marched toward a significant religious site that serves both Jewish and Christian communities, an area known for historic significance in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

"We were simply exercising our freedom to peaceful protest against what we believe is unjust expansion beyond recognized borders," one Palestinian activist told CNN amidst tears while being handcuffed by police officers, who maintain a tense presence at all times during such events in the city's Old City. Jerusalem-based political analyst Dr. Leah Schwartz also commented that this comes as no surprise given past incidents of unrest and stricter security measures lately: "The sentiment against expansion has grown fiercer among many Palestinians, especially those who see it encroaching on their historical lands."

Protests have been occurring regularly across various cities within Israel since the announcement by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last month that Israeli forces will begin patrolling areas of southern West Bank close to Jerusalem. Despite numerous diplomatic efforts and calls for restraint from international leaders, tensions remain high between Jewish settlers living in these territories on one side, Palestinian residents displaced during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war another; both sides claim historical ownership of this area that Israel regards as part of its territory.

According to statistics from the Israeli Police Department released earlier today, security forces responded with tear gas and water cannons after marchers approached key locations near al-Aqsa Mosque/Temple Mount complex - a sacred site for Muslims around world but also considered by Jews as their ancient temple. Eyewitness Rachel Goldstein reports seeing demonstrators chanting slogans condemning territorial claims and calling upon both Israelis and Palestinians to seek compromise: "We demand peace, not conflict," she said firmly yet softly while being escorted away from the scene by police officers bearing batons.

In recent years, there have been numerous high-profile protests over similar issues - some of them resulting in clashes between activists and law enforcement agencies leading to injury or loss of life on both sides as well as property damage at times; however today's confrontations appear somewhat calmer despite continued frustration felt by many Palestinians living under Israeli control. The Israel Defense Forces, responsible for security within the country, were reported deploying extra troops in anticipation of potential trouble spots around Jerusalem following an incident earlier this week when hundreds took part in a massive demonstration that quickly turned violent outside Ramallah's main square after hours-long talks between Palestinian leadership and Israeli Prime Minister failed to yield any concrete results.

International reaction continues mixed as several world leaders expressed concern over escalating tensions but also emphasized support for dialogue among stakeholders involved in the ongoing conflict: "We encourage both sides towards peaceful resolution based upon mutual respect," UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said during his visit to Jordan last night. However, senior Palestinian official Hassan Younis stressed that any compromise must take into account
