NHL team owner Michael Green was reported in police custody yesterday evening following a high-speed chase on New York's BQE that ended when officers shot and injured him with beanbag rounds; he is expected to recover but could face serious charges for allegedly driving under the influence of marijuana, authorities said.

The 49-year-inmates has a history checkered with both commendable achievements on the ice as well personal turmoil and legal troubles off it in New York City's most famous borough since his team had just won their first championship title this season last Tuesday. His arrest occurred at approximately 9:30pm when witnesses reported seeing a vehicle swerving between lanes, leading to pursuit by the NYPD’s Highway Patrol Unit and other squadrons of officers on motorcycles throughout Brooklyn Heights into Downtown Manhattan before pulling over near the Fulton Street Station around 10:30pm.

"We were following him closely after he had been pulled over earlier for an equipment violation," said Inspector Joseph Martinez, who took command of pursuing units as soon they got wind of Green's erratic driving patterns which officers noted showed possible signs of intoxication from marijuana or another substance before the confrontation with law enforcement. "I remember seeing red lights in his eyes when we caught up to him near 10:35pm."

Green is currently being treated at a hospital after receiving several beanbag round hits amid heavy police resistance while trying desperately — unsuccessfully — not to ram into officers or pedestrians alike; one bystander told the DailyMail.com they were watching in horror as his vehicle swerved and almost knocked down two people before crashing their own SUV after an attempted turn around when he realized police presence was near, while another witness reported a scream that sounded like Green yelling "I don't care what happens I just want to get home!" prior to the altercation.

The driver and owner of the New Jersey Devils hockey team has faced legal issues in years past for driving under suspension as well; his most recent encounter with law enforcement took place last June on Long Island where he allegedly drove erratically while intoxicated after leaving an Elvis impersonation gig, leading to a $300 fine and two-year license revocation.

"The safety of our officers is paramount as well we have protocols in cases like this," said Captain Jennifer Lee who took command during the pursuit; "We had no choice but take action when he started swerving erratically between lanes." 

A representative for Green released a statement denying intoxication and claiming his erratic driving was due to fatigue after hours spent at Devils games, conferences and charity events. However this has been disputed by both the NYPD as well witness accounts who say he appeared under influence while on scene; further examinations will take place overnight followed with potential criminal charges filed early next week which could result in an extended custody sentence if found guilty beyond reckless driving allegations including endangering public safety.

New Jersey Devils hockey team manager Mark Johnson said: "We are deeply saddened by these events; Mr Green has always been a dedicated and hardworking individual with years of loyalty to our organization." The DailyMail.com reached out for comment from the NHL which released no statement
