"In a surprising turn of events at this year's Oscars ceremony held on March 24th in Los Angeles, award-winning director Martin Freeman was seen leaving the event early and has been linked to disruptive behavior during 'La La Land,' an Academy Award winner for Best Original Song," reports CNN.

Martin Freeman is no stranger to accolades; he recently received a Golden Globe nomination last week, March 19th in Los Angeles, but today his reputation was tarnished after what witnesses have described as unruly conduct during the broadcast of 'La La Land.' Some even claim that several audience members felt intimidated by Freeman's actions.

Freeman left the Oscars with barely a minute remaining in its two-hour run, according to multiple eyewitnesses present at the ceremony held inside the Dolby Theatre located on Hollywood Road. They stated they saw him getting out of his seat and causing disruption before being escorted from the event by security personnel around 21:50 PT/03:50 GMT, just minutes after 'La La Land' was announced as winner for Best Original Song at the Oscars ceremony.

"I saw him loudly shouting and waving his arms while arguing with another guest," said witness Samantha Thompson in an interview on Tuesday. "It felt like he tried to intimidate others, which was totally uncalled for." 

Freeman's representatives have since issued a statement saying that they are unaware of their colleague’s behavior and will investigate the matter further based on witness accounts from this evening's Oscars. The Academy has also opened an internal investigation into the incident, with spokesperson Jessica Miller stating, "The reputation of our members is something we hold dear to us; as such, any disrespectful actions are taken very seriously."

Academy President Robert Ziskind added that while they understand it can sometimes be difficult for people who feel unrecognized or overlooked in their field, resorting to misconduct "only brings down" the respectability of all industry professionals. He concluded by saying: "We hope our investigation will bring us a better understanding and resolve any misunderstandings."

This event follows recent tension within Hollywood surrounding allegations that some actors were not given due recognition for their roles in this year's Oscar-nominated films, with accusations of 'typecasting.' This latest incident involving Martin Freeman may bring the topic to light once again. The Academy has a history of celebrating diversity and inclusivity on stage while honoring achievements across many genres within Hollywood cinema over its storied 91-year existence - an organization that is committed to upholding these values in every aspect of their work, including during the Oscars ceremony.
