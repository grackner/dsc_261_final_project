A rare species of turtle believed to have been extinct for decades has miracstrically made a comeback in Brazil's Atlantic rainforest, drawing attention from scientists and conservation groups alike as they celebrate the news while also reflecting on what this means for global biodiversity.

Brazilian researchers announced today that sightings of the critically endangered Piac-Amarela tortoise (Podocnemis corrugata) have been confirmed in a protected area within the Atlantic forest, known locally as Mata Atlantica Brasileira, after its last definitive spotting was reported over 30 years ago. The discovery came about when biologists observed an adult female turtle during a routine survey on March 25th by her unique green and brown carapace patterned with orange markings that scientists previously documented as the species' hallmark in their field guides of old records from before its believed extinction.

"We were astounded when we saw it, not just because Piac-Amarela is a remarkable turtle but also knowing how hard they fight for survival," said biologist Dr. Helena Santos as she described the momentous find during her interview with CNN Brazil this morning. "To see such resilience in life here on Earth reminds us that nature still has secrets to unveil."

The last sighting of Piac-Amarela was reported by biologist Fernando Menezes when he went back into the rainforest, hoping for a sign of wildlife during his weekly walk through parts unknown; what ended up happening on those same paths led him and colleagues to an unexpected encounter with one this year - proving that sometimes conservation efforts only need patience.

Fernando told CNN Brazil he had walked more than 30 kilometers in the rainforest when a movement from behind his backpack caught his eye — it took Menezes two minutes of careful searching through dense foliage and bushy undergrowth to get an up-close view of what appeared at first glance like nothing but another ordinary river turtle. "That's the moment I knew something special was here," he recalled, remembering his steps stopping as soon as a head peeked out from muddy waters where local streams meet before flowing into deeper parts that connect directly with the Atlantic Ocean along this stretch of Brazilian forest landscape known for its rich biodiversity and natural habitats.

The Piac-Amarela, or "green saddlebags" due to markings resembling leather straps across their shells (podocnemis), is not just a remarkable specimen in terms of appearances but also ecology; scientists believe its presence here signals an incredibly rare comeback after being thought extinct since the late 19th century. The last known sightings had occurred way back in September and October throughout various locales within Mata Atlantica Brasileira, which spans across several states including Rio de Janeiro state near Guanabara Bay area where urban centers like Sao Paulo also have forest remnants but much less biodiversity compared to more pristine areas such as Serra do Mar.

"This is an astonishing find and it's a beacon of hope for endangered species worldwide," said Dr. Maria Gomes, Director at Conservation International-Brazil when interviewed by CNN Brazil today after being briefed about the Piac-Am
