On Saturday afternoon at Mestalla Stadium in Lisbon, Portugal, a young striker from Chelsea FC found himself embroiled in controversy during an intense UEFA Champions League match against Benfica. The player, who has requested to remain unnamed for privacy reasons, was seen using his hands after receiving the ball inside of the penalty area — actions that are strictly prohibited under soccer's Laws 12 and 14 unless he is playing goalkeeper within their respective areas or performing a throw-in.

"The referee blew for me immediately," said another Chelsea player, who witnessed his teammate making the handball error in stoppage time of the first half. "We all knew it was bad news for our chances to advance." 

This incident came just a day after Benfica's triumph over Manchester United at Wanda Metropolitano Stadium — one that had fans across Spain on their feet cheering and singing along with national anthem as they witnessed the victory of Eusébio, who is revered in Portuguese football history. 

A Chelsea supporter described his team's poor showing against Benfica saying "we have been struggling to find our form for a while now but that handball just brought home all those issues." The error was deemed so egregious by the referee, Luis Miguel Cabezón García, who also showed leniency towards Chelsea midfielder Mason Mount as he granted him two yellow cards.

"It's a tough game for both teams," Benfica coach Sérgio Pereira acknowledged after Monday night' endorsement of his team with victory on the score line 2-0 against rivals Porto, which secured their spot in quarterfinal matches starting next month where they will face Barcelona.

Early reports suggest that despite Chelsea striker’s misjudgment and subsequent two-match suspension from UEFA for foul play inside of a penalty area, the club remain hopeful as there are still games left on their calendar this season to make up lost ground before they head back into European competition next year.

"We all understand mistakes happen," said Chelsea captain Cesar Azpitarte in an interview with BBC Sport Channel after his team's match against Benfica, "but the important thing is that we learn from them and work even harder for future games."
