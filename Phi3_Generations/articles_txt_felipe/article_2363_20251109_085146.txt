A powerful earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 7.8 struck near Hualien County in Taiwan on Saturday night at around 10:32pm local time (UTC+8), causing widespread damage, panic among residents and prompting an immediate response from government officials to ensure public safety and provide assistance where needed.

Tseng Wen-hua, a resident of the nearby Taipei suburb of Ruifang said she was asleep when her home suddenly started shaking violently about 30 minutes after the quake struck. “I immediately woke up my family members and we all ran outside for safety just like everyone else in our neighborhood,” Tseng told CNN, recounting their frightening experience with tremors still being felt across Taiwan several hours later on Sunday evening at around 4:57pm local time (UTC+8).

Tseng's home suffered some structural damage during the earthquake as bricks and tiles fell from her walls. “I saw shattered glass everywhere, even in places I never imagined it would end up,” she said with tears welling up in her eyes as CNN speakers interviewed several other residents who shared similar stories of destruction while praising their loved ones’ safety thanks to early evacuation orders issued by local authorities.

The strongest earthquake ever recorded on Taiwan's island chain since 1935 took place near the west coast city-state, with its epicenter just offshore from Hualien County – one of Asia's most geologically active regions prone to seismic activity. Residents along eastern shores across a wide swathe including Taitung and Yilan counties were strongly affected by the quake while reports indicated that it was felt as far away in Japan, where people took precautionary measures amidst tremors still being recorded over 12 hours later on Sunday evening at around 4:57pm local time (UTC+8).

Chen Chih-yuan from Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau confirmed that seismic activity continued well after the initial quake with magnitudes ranging between 3 and 6.0 measured in different parts of eastern coastal areas, although no additional destructive earthquakes occurred following Sunday morning’s strong shaking sequence which triggered an immediate response from government officials across Taiwan to assess damage caused by Saturday night's event as well as possible aftershock risks that could affect public safety over the coming days and weeks.

Emergency management authorities have deployed hundreds of personnel throughout affected areas while local governments, together with various international organizations such as Red Cross Japan and UNICEF Taiwan are working in collaboration to provide immediate humanitarian assistance alongside long-term recovery plans for rebuilding efforts aimed at restoring normalcy over the coming months.

“This is a tough situation that will test our resilience but it’s essential we come together as one community and support each other through these challenging times,” Hualien County Mayor Chang Chen-huai told CNN reporters gathered on ground level at Tseng Wen-hua's home where many evacuees have sought temporary shelter while waiting out aftershock warnings.

Experts believe that although most buildings in Taiwan are earthquake-resistant, the magnitude of this rare and devastating quake has exceeded design standards with potential for structural damage or collapse depending on construction quality; meanwhile authorities ur
