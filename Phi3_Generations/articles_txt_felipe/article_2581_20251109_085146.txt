A Ugandan refugee camp in Rwanda has become a hotspot for medical attention as an outbreak of measles grips one of Africa's most densely populated areas this month. As health workers scramble to contain the spread, international aid is pouring into Kigeme Refugee Camp just outside of Gicumbi District in Rwanda where over 120 suspected cases have been reported since early February alone. The Ugandan refugees are not the only ones affected; some locals living near the camp have also begun showing symptoms, with concerns that more communities may soon follow suit as travelers continue to enter and leave Rwanda through its porous borders along with neighboring countries like Tanzania and Burundi.

“We're worried about our neighbors,” said Nyakikomwa Muturi, a resident of Kigeme Village who has witnessed the rapid rise in numbers firsthand over recent weeks. “Seeing so many sick people every day is hard for us.” 

Rwanda’thighly-centralized governmental agency that handles refugee affairs—the Immigration and Emigration Authority (IMEA)— has been monitoring the situation closely at Kigeme Refugee Camp, where approximately 60% of its residents are from Ugandan villages such as Gatabu in Ntorogo Sub County. "Our team is on high alert," said Dr. Emmanuel Rugunda, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Disaster Management and Refugees (MIDMAR). “We have increased medical screenings at our camps to quickly identify cases.”

Since 2019, when measles made headlines across Africa due to underreported outbreaks in countries like Ethiopia with over half a million confirmed cases leading to more than 365,000 deaths — mostly children— MIDMAR has been ramping up efforts at Kigeme Refugee Camp. According to the World Health Organization's (WHO) Africa Regional Office Director for Uganda and Rwanda Dr. Alexandra Boulton-Bellamy, “measles is highly contagious when people gather in crowded places like camps or markets—it’s no surprise we see outbreaks here.”

Measles symptoms typically start with a runny nose and fever that worsens over 2–3 days. Children may also experience cough, red eyes, sore throat, small white spots inside the mouth known as Koplik's spots before developing a full-blown rash covering their face to the lower legs within this timeframe too quickly spreading among those living in poor conditions or unsanitary surroundings. 

MIDMAR has been working hard alongside partners like UNICEF and World Vision International, who are providing measles vaccinations for refugee children while distributing food aid directly into the hands of families struggling due to inflation affecting all corners of East Africa since October last year; however with new cases still appearing every day—it remains an uphill battle fighting what UNICEF Regional Director for Uganda and Rwanda Siobhan Crowley describes as one “of many emergencies across our region.”

Local health experts say that even though they've vaccinated thousands of children within Kigeme Refugee Camp over the last
