In an unexpected turn of events that has rattled even die-hard fans across America, former NBA superstar Anthony Johnson is taking his talents off the court and into a new arena - podcasting. Since Monday evening's game at Madison Square Garden in New York City where he was part of Team Elite with contemporaries like Shaquille O’Neal, there has been chatter about what might have led to this drastic career change just five years after retirement from the Los Angeles Lakers back in 2018.

Anthony Johnson'sempty-seater position on his team was never more than an empty seat for him as he struggled with consistency throughout seasons, often leading people like ex-teammate and coach Larry Brown to question whether it would have been better if the NBA had drafted someone else in his place.

"It's a shame," said Smithfield High School basketball player Alex Thompson who grew up admiring Johnson as one of the biggest names on TV during Saturday morning cartoons, "I always dreamt about playing for him."

As reports continue to pour out and speculations grow louder in between playoff games nationwide this weekend with numbers suggesting a 32% drop in attendance compared to last year due primarily because of Anthony Johnson's unforeseen career shift, here are some insights into the former star’s motivations:

"I had always dreamt about taking my own path and speaking for myself," said an emotional yet resolute Thompson. "Maybe it was time I stopped watching from afar." 

Anthony Johnson's transition to podcasting has sparked intrigue not only among basketball enthusiasts but also within the sports media industry itself, which remains curious as ever about former players’ motivations and actions after their active days on court are over. The ex-NBA star is currently hosting a five-episode series entitled 'Off-Court Chronicles', where he intends to share stories of his experiences playing for the likes of Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul Jabbar among others while also discussing challenges faced by players in their post-retirement years.

The former star’s move has been met with mixed reactions from fans and media alike - some applaud it as brave self-exploration; critics argue that he might have chosen a better fit for his skills, such as coaching or commentating on TV broadcasts rather than podcasting. However there's no denying the fact that Johnson has always been an innovative spirit when navigating through life’s obstacles - after all – from changing careers mid-life to retiring early and later launching a successful clothing line for athletes, he just can't seem help himself but reinvent.

Speaking on his decision, Johnson said: "The basketball court is where I found myself during my prime years as an athlete - it’s only natural that when those days are over and no longer consuming the majority of our lives, we seek alternative ways to engage with ourselves." 

As 'Off-Court Chronicles' continue on in episodes every other Wednesday until September first, Anthony Johnson hopes his story will resonate not just as one man’s tale but also inspire others considering a change after retirement. For now though - he promises to keep us all guessing what comes next for this former NBA star turned podcaster: "Who knows? Maybe I'll start hosting
