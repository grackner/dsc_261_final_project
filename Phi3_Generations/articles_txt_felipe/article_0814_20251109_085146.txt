Topic: Style - Luxury

A $20 million-dollar boutique hotel in Beverly Hills has captured global attention for its unprecedented style and opulence since opening last month on May 5th. The establishment named 'The Enchantress' boasts an exquisite design inspired by the Baroque era, complete with grandiose chandeliers hanging from ornate ceilings in a space measuring over 70,000 square feet across two stories.

Designer Vivienne Reedley stated that her vision was to create an experience where guests would feel as though they've stepped into another time period while enjoying modern comforts: "The Enchantress is about blending the luxurious past with present-day indulgence, offering a unique escapade for those seeking exclusivity."

Guests have already begun to flock from around the world. A recent survey by The Luxe Magazine indicates that 80% of visitors felt their stay was beyond compare in style and elegance compared to other hotels they've visited before, with many expressing a desire for return trips as often within two years post-stay.

Local fashion critics have praised the boutique hotel’s attire regulations - guests are required to wear formal evening dress codes while on site — adding an extra layer of sophistication that complements The Enchantress' overall atmosphere: "It is rare these days for a guest wardrobe choice to directly impact their experience, but here in Beverly Hills – you don’t come close," said fashion journalist Robert Foster.

The hotel has already begun planning its next grand event - an exclusive art exhibit that promises to showcase works by some of the most talented artists from around the world as well provide a platform for emerging local talent; The Enchantress CEO, Sarah Thompson stated: "This will be another chance not only to highlight our hotel's commitment towards luxury but also support and promote artistic creativity."

Next week is set to begin with an opening night gala attended by celebrities. As the exclusive event approaches later this month, The Enchantress prepares for a full house of guests ready to experience true grandeur like never before in their style life journey – setting new benchmarks as they redefine luxury and opulence within reach.
