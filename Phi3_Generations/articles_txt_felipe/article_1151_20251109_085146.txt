In a recent event that has sparked both concern and urgency among Asian nations, two small islands off Indonesia's eastern coastline faced an unprecedented crisis when they were hit by the worst flooding in decades last weekend. The archipelago of Atambua on the island of Timor Leste was particularly hard-hit after a torrential downpour, with thousands left stranded as water levels rose dramatically overnight.


The rainfall began early Saturday morning and continued unabated for hours before subsiding at dawn Sunday, leaving behind muddy streets that were once bustling market places turned into impassable rivers. The Indonesian government's meteorological agency confirmed the downpour broke several records in terms of volume and speed over a 24-hour period on Atambua island alone.


Local fisherman Sunaryo, who has been navigating these waters for years now tells CNN that "never before have we seen water like this; it rushed into our villages as if the sea was coming ashore." As of Monday morning, authorities estimate around 250 families are still in evacuation shelters after being rescued. The provincial capital Malikula has been designated a disaster zone and will receive additional aid from surrounding provinces for clean-up operations which have already begun on Sunday night into Tuesday afternoon with the help of military vehicles, tents, food packages, and blankets provided by local charities and non-profits.


"The floodwaters brought more than just water to our homes; they unearthed decades' worth of hidden memories," said 52-year-old widow Lestari as she sat in the temporary shelter on Sunday afternoon, clutching a faded photo album from her husband who was lost at sea years prior.


The disaster has raised questions about climate change and its impacts across Asia's densely populated nations prone to extreme weather events like typhos and floods due in part to rising temperatures, experts say. Indonesia is already grappling with a severe drought that preceded the torrential rains leading up this disaster which some scientists claim are becoming increasingly unpredictable across parts of Asia.


Efforts on relief operations continue today and officials have begun calling for regional cooperation, sharing resources as needed to ensure swift recovery in all affected provinces throughout Indonesia's sprawling archipelago nation where 270 million people live together amidst over a thousand islands across the Pacific Ocean.
