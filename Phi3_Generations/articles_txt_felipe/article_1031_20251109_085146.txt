New York City officials have announced a travel advisory warning for tourists visiting Times Square as of January 15th due to concerns over extreme cold weather conditions that could pose health risks and transportation disrufer issues. Official spokesperson Sarah Johnson stated, "While New York remains one of the most vibrant places in the world during winter months, this year's temperatures have been significantly colder than normal." The advisory comes at a time when annual events such as Times Square Lights Festival and Radio City Rockettes are scheduled to take place on January 20th.

The extreme cold wave has already affected various parts of the city with record-breaking low temperatures being reported across New York's five boroughs, including Central Park which hit a chilling minus 18 degrees Fahrenheit yesterday (January 15). Health experts are concerned that prolonged exposure to such frigid conditions could increase the risk of hypothermia and frostbite among visitors. The MTA has reported multiple delays on public transportation due to ice formation, impacting commuting across Manhattan's streets and subways.

In an effort to mitigate risks associated with cold weather exposure for tourists who might not be accustomed to such harsh winter conditions as compared to locals or frequent travelers in colder climates, Mayor Bill de Blasio stated: "We want all our visitors and residents alike to safely enjoy their time here during this holiday season. While we wish you a happy New Year ahead."

Visitors are advised against prolonged outdoor exposure unless necessary for transportation or essential errands in the city, especially after 6 p.m when temperatures typically drop lower and visibility conditions can become hazardous due to foggy weather patterns common during colder months here. Residents and visitors alike are urged not only to bundle up appropriately but also remain vigilant for any signs of frostbite or hypothermia, as these conditions could be life-threatening if left untreated.

John Carter, a local restaurateur who owns multiple dining establishments in Times Square says he has seen an uptick in tourists coming to his area despite the advisory and is working hard with staff to keep them safe while enjoying their time here during these chilly winter days: "It's definitely been busier than usual, but we are ensuring all our guests stay warm as well. We offer a free hot cider service for everyone who walks in."

In response, tourism officials have recommended booking transport and accommodations ahead of time to ensure availability during the busy seasonal period while urging visitors not travel unless essential trips are necessary due to unpredictable weather patterns forecasted. Officials also plan on providing regular updates as conditions improve or worsen over coming days in order for tourists to stay safe, informed and prepared when exploring Times Square this winter holiday.
