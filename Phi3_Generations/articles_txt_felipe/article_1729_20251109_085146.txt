A massive fire that erupted in a residential area of Kolkata last night has resulted in at least six fatalities and left over twenty people unaccounted for amidst the ongoing power cuts across West Bengal, India's easternmost state. As per reports from local authorities dated September 5th, around fourteen homes were engulfed by flames starting just before midnight near Sreebhumi Locality in Kolkata’selong with two death certificates already issued for the elderly victims who are yet to be identified beyond their relationships.

The fire came during a challenging period of frequent power outages across parts of West Bengal, which have left many areas without electricity and created hazardous living conditions amidst extreme heat waves making it particularly dangerous as temperatures can soar upwards of 40 degrees Celsius in some regions. Local witnesses claimed that the blaze started unexpectedly inside a house where an open electrical appliance was found near frayed wires, which led firefighters to believe this incident could have been sparked by faulty infrastructure as well as substandard living conditions prevalent among residents in some parts of Kolkata.

A local resident and witness named Raju Nath said that the smoke started pouring out from his neighbor's house around 12:30 AM while he was awake due to power cut-offs, which led him quickly rushing outside with other neighbors for a better view of what appeared like a minor accident until it rapidly grew into something much more calamitous. "I saw thick smoke billowing out and within seconds heard loud explosions as the flames leaped through window panes", he recounted, adding that some relatives had to be rescued from upper floors before police arrived on scene at around 1:30 AM.

The Kolkata Fire Service Department has sent a team of firefighters and engineers for an urgent assessment along with the local municipality officials as they investigate whether negligence, infrastructure failure or unplanned power cuts played any role in starting this tragic event which is continuing to cause havoc on already distressed families. Official statistics indicate that Kolkata alone accounts for approximately 1% of total fatalities during the past two years' natural calamity trends, most often attributed as flash floods or landslides due to heavy monsoon rains while this fire-related incident is a rare occurrence within city limits where high temperatures have always been recorded in summers albeit not exceeding an extreme scale.

The Kolkata Chief Municipal Commissioner has assured that authorities are doing their best amid the power cut situation and taking necessary measures to bring relief but emphasized on creating awareness about electrical safety precautions for citizens while urging people living under poverty-stricken circumstances not be discouraged or lose hope in such trying times. A local civil rights activist, Rina Gupta has voiced concerns over the need for immediate social reforms and stricter regulations regarding rental properties that often harbor a multitude of inhabitants with little space between them but insists on collective efforts to raise awareness among all demographics.

A spokesperson from West Bengal Electricity Regulatory Commission clarified, "We have already conducted several investigations and found no evidence of power theft or abnormalities in supply that could lead such an incident but we continue our probe as
