In a bold move that could reshape children's television programming in America, streaming giant Disney+ announced yesterday its plans to launch a standalone kids network exclusively for underage audiences on October 10th. The innovative platform will feature original content tailored specifically towards various age groups and interests within the younger demographic ranging from infants to teenagers aged ten years old, with programming hours starting at noon Eastern Time (ET).

Jessica Smithson, Disney's Chief Communications Officer said in an interview "The creation of this kids network reflects our commitment towards developing meaningful content that not only entertains but also educates and fosters creativity among the younger generation." While most streaming platforms have limited offerings for children due to advertising restrictions, Smithson assured parents their exclusive service would be ad-free with a strong focus on age-appropriate material.

The Disney+ kids network launch comes amid concerns about screen time and media consumption habits among youngsters in the U.S., according to several recent studies citing that American children spend nearly seven hours per day engaged in sedentary activities, including watching television or videos on electronic devices. With this move from one of Hollywood's most influential families entering into direct competition with PBS Kids and Nickelodeon for young viewers aged two-to-nine years old – the entertainment industry has a new contender to consider when creating content aimed at children under ten, as per Dr. Linda Johnson, Senior Media Analyst of Child Development Institute.

"With Disney+ entering this market niche with its own kids network on an October 10th release date – we're going see quite a significant shift in the landscape," she tells CNN Midday News Hour, adding "Their investment into creating quality original content has already sparked conversations among industry insiders."

In order to cater for various age groups on their platform Disney+ will launch three distinct channels: one for kids aged two-to-five years old (DreamLand), six-to-nine years of age (AdventureWare) and a teen channel targeting ages ten to eleven. All programming hours are expected to start at noon ET, with parental controls available throughout the service for added safety measures according to Disney+ Communications Manager Tim Rogers who explains "We have designed our content specifically around these age-specific groups in order to maintain relevance and educational value within their formative years."

This comes after a successful pilot test run of DreamLand with over 20,000 children aged two-to-five from select areas such as Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City participated. Parents whose children were part of the trial expressed positive feedback towards Disney+'s approach to catering for age groups within a specific range stating "The content is relatable and relevant with my little one at this stage in her life".

CNN reached out to several child psychologists regarding their take on streaming services being consumed by young children. Dr. Emily Thompson, Director of Child Psychology told CNN Midday News Hour that while she understands parents' concerns about excessive screen time it is important for content creators such as Disney+ provide engaging and enriching experiences for the younger generation in a healthy way: "When done correctly - this can help children learn social skills, foster imagination through fantastical narratives or teach basic concepts like numbers," she adds.
