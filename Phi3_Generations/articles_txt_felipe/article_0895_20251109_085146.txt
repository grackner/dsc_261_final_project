A new mindfulness program has been introduced in overcrowded hospitals across New York City as a way to ease patient anxiety and stress levels while waiting for treatment or consultation with healthcare professionals, reports the CNN Business News Service on March 10th. With wait times stretching up to three hours during peak periods before COVID-19 struck, patients have been under considerable pressure in emergency departments (EDs) at hospit endcCross Manhattan Medical Center and Staten Island University Hospital since January this year when the program commenced its pilot phase with 50 participants. The project's success led to full implementation by February as part of a more comprehensive approach aimed not only at improving individual patient experiences but also addressing burnout amongst healthcare workers, which has been identified in recent surveys and studies as one of the biggest challenges faced across various sectors globally.

"The program's initial success is encouraging," says Dr. Samantha Rodriguez, an Emergency Medicine Physician at Manhattan Medical Center who spearheaded this initiative alongside a team of psychologists and researchers from the city's leading universities on Mind-Body Wellness Studies. "By teaching our patients basic mindfulness techniques before they even see their doctors here in New York City, we can help reduce anxiety levels while waiting for treatment—this helps not only with immediate patient comfort but also contributes to a more positive working environment overall."

Participants engage in guided meditation and breathing exercises led by qualified instructors before seeing their healthcare providers; research shows that mindfulness techniques can help calm nerves and reduce stress levels, leading directly back into how it helps both patients' experience at the hospital. A psychologist from Queens University specializing in Mind-Body Wellbeing adds to this point: "By incorporating these simple practices beforehand with those who come for emergency care or consultations – whether due to injury on Staten Island Hospital EDs, acute pain syndromes elsewhere across NYC health facilities - everyone benefits from creating more positive experiences together."

Evidence is mounting that mindfulness-based programs can help in mitigating burnout among medical staff as well. A recent survey revealed 80% of doctors reported feeling less emotionally drained after participating regularly, and many patients noted they felt "more present" during their visits once the program began rolling out at various hospitals across New York City earlier this year (January-February pilot phase).

Dr. Rodriguez believes incorporating mindfulness into daily life can improve staff resilience to burnout while improving care delivery as a result: "It's been very inspiring watching the positive feedback from doctors, nurses and other frontline healthcare workers in our city who are already practicing these techniques every day," says Dr. Rodriguez on Tuesday afternoon after speaking with some of her colleagues directly about this initiative as part of an internal newsletter update shared at a medical center board meeting earlier that same week; "Incorporating mindfulness practices into work life is something we can all benefit from for our own well-being and those around us—we are excited to continue scaling up these efforts throughout New York City's hospitals going forward."

For patients who might be skeptical or hesitant, healthcare professionals assure them this program was developed with input from ther
