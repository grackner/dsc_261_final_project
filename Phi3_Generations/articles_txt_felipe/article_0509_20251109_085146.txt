Former Chicago Bears defensive star Brian Cushing will face a potential four-game suspension for violating NFL's drug policy by using steroids and other banned substances between March of last year and January, the league announced on Tuesday in what sources have described as one of its longest disciplinary cases ever.

The 32-year-injured Cushing was suspended without pay for part of the regular season by then coach Marc Trimble who said he would return to practice with the team but not yet play against his old club, which had just beaten Chicago in a divisional playoff game last December. The Bears lost 37-16 at Atlanta on Sunday and Cushing was taken off injured reserve after playing three games while wearing a brace from an abdominal injury suffered early that year during the preseason camp, which he had to attend as part of his rehab process before returning for training camps.

"I can't help but wonder if I would have gotten caught and faced penalties like this," said Cushing who has since been released from Chicago Bears practice squad along with fellow players Anthony Hargrove, Marquise Smith and Brandon McGee (the latter three were placed on IR for various injuries).

"I feel sick to my stomach every time I think about what's happening," said Trimble who was fired from his job last month after serving as the defensive coordinator of this roster built around Cushing and others like him. "It makes me question everything."

The NFL Players Association, meanwhile, had no immediate comment on how to proceed with negotiations surrounding possible grievances against clubs that use banned substances in an effort by some teams' management members as a competitive edge through performance enhancement drugs at times. But sources say the union was concerned about several players who were also involved and not just Cushing himself, leading them into action planning how best to approach this issue legally while dealing with fallout of public opinion against team owners for enabling such practices among their stars under a culture where winning is everything above personal integrity.

Aside from the NFL drug policy which explicitly prohibits use and distribution by players or staff members, there are other league-sanctioned guidelines in place to help ensure fair competition based on ability rather than artificially created advantage through performance enhancers such as steroids commonly used among professional athletes seeking quicker recovery times from injuries like those suffered so often seen over recent years during games or practices while some players choose this route instead of maintaining strict adherence to drug-free lifestyles.

"I believe there needs be an urgent relook at how the league can safeguard its reputation as a sport committed solely towards talent development, not substance abuse," said NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell who has been vocal about efforts by him and his colleagues to tackle these problems directly through education programs.

One such example came into focus recently with reports from sources saying that Cleveland Browns' defensive end Jabari Price had tested positive twice for banned substances last year but avoided penalties due mainly because he never faced any suspension beforehand; however, now Cushing is likely to get an even harsher punishment than those previously handed out.

A source familiar with the case told CNN that tests conducted on samples collected between March and January found evidence of steroids in Brian's urine along with other substances linked
