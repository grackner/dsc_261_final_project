Fauquier County School Board Votes to Pilot a Mandatory Daily Meditation Program for All Students; Expert Says It May Help Curb Teen Depression and Anxiety Rates in the Community

Fauquier County Schools have implemented a daily meditation program for all students as part of their health curriculum. This pilot initiative will begin in the fall semester and run through December before it is reviewed by state officials.    
In Fauquier, North Carolina—a community known to be particularly hard hit with teen anxiety cases since 2019 according to a local study led by Dr. Maria Sanchez at nearby Liberty University’s psychology department—the move came after years of advocacy from parents and mental health professionals in the area.    
The program, endorsed during Fauquier County School Board's meeting yesterday morning lasting about three hours with representatives ranging from teachers to school board members present for discussion and voting on its future direction, is expected to be rolled out this fall semester starting at age 10 in all public elementary schools.    
“I believe that mindfulness practice has the potential not just to help children cope better but also enhance their academic performance,” said Dr. Angela Wright from Fauquier General Hospital during yesterday’s meeting, who previously served as a psychologist for students at local high schools and colleges in neighboring counties over two decades ago before taking up her current role three years back after returning to the community following an extended period working with adolescents on their mental health issues across Virginia.  
“We need to equip our young ones here not just academically but also emotionally and mentally.”    
Fauquier Public School Superintendent Dr. Thomas Reynolds expressed during last night’s press conference that, although they've been working closely with teachers in developing this new curriculum for the past year (during which time he himself was invited on several tours by advocates) to ensure it would fit within their existing schedule and learning goals without disrupting classroom dynamics—with a particular focus keeping students engaged as possible.  
“I want our kids here in Fauquier County, where we've seen such an increase in cases of anxiety among teens since 2019 especially linked to social media pressures that affect the way they interact and communicate within their peer group,” he says during yesterday’s conference call with local reporters. “I believe mindfulness practices will serve as a positive alternative for them.”    
Parents across Fauquier have voiced out support throughout this past year after witnessing firsthand what experts like Dr. Emily Chang, assistant professor at the University of Virginia who specializes in adolescent psychology and studies linked to mindfulness practices back during her visit last fall when she presented findings that meditation improved teenage students’ ability to cope with stress—with positive feedback coming from their children too.    
“I want my child here in Fauquier County, where we've seen such an increase of anxiety among kids especially linked to social media pressures and I believe mindfulness practices will serve as a good alternative for them,” said Mrs. Susan Anderson yesterday afternoon after school pick-up while her son Alex was on his way home from the local middle school with friends,
