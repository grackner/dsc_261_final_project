In a major revamp of city transport hub design philosophy, New York City has announced plans to incorporate biophilic elements into its existing subway stations across Manhattan and Brooklyn within the next two years. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) today unveiled this transformative project aimed at enhancing passenger comfort while promoting environmental sustainability in public spaces.

"As we move towards a greener future, integrating nature into our infrastructure is an essential step," said MTA Chairperson Pat Foye during the press conference yesterday afternoon on Wall Street. The ambitious plan calls for installing live plant walls within subway station interiors as well as creating green roofs and vertical gardens atop existing structures across 15 key stations, all by December of next year's end according to MTA officials.

The selected design team behind this visionary project consists of renowned architect Maya Linson whose portfolio includes the High Line park in West Chelsea - an unparalleled success story where old railway lines have been transformed into lush green public spaces for community engagement and environmental respite amidst city life. 

"We want to create a sense of calm within bustling urban environments; this project will serve as an escape from the concrete jungle that New York City is," Linson explained during her interview on WABC News last night before leaving for another site visit in Queens with MTA officials and representatives. 

Efforts are already underway at three stations, including Fulton Street Station in Downtenerave to replace old asphalt walls with plant-filled partitions made of recycled materials while preserving historical aspects of the subway station's original design from 1925. Other locations being redeveloped include Jay St./Metrotech and Myrtle Ave/East New York, where green rooftop gardens will be established to offset energy usage within these stations by absorbing sunlight for photosynthesis purposes along with providing an extra layer of insulation against external temperature fluctuations.

Experts from both the fields of ecology and urban design stress on how biophilic designs can bring about significant health benefits like reduced stress levels, increased cognitive functioning among commuters due to enhanced connection between humans with nature which studies show leads towards improved mental wellbeing overall; not only that but it is also beneficial for the environment by purifying air and reducing urban heat island effect.

City Council Speaker Corey Johnson praised this initiative, saying "These stations are essential components of New York's transit network – upgrading them will provide a better experience for millions daily commuting while setting an example worldwide on sustainable city planning." Residents and commuters alike express excitement over the prospect of nature-integrated public spaces in their everyday lives amidst urban environments.

As this green wave continues, local businesses see potential growth opportunities through eco-friendly merchandise partnerships with MTA stations' design team as well creating awareness about biophilic concepts among community members who might not yet be aware of these developments and their importance towards our environment.

Officials assure that this pilot project will serve as a blueprint for other cities globally, encouraging them to embrace similar eco-conscious transformations in public infrastructures henceforth; creating lasting impact on future generations who would inherit these spaces while enjoying the benefits
