In an unprecedented move that has shocked nations across Asia, a catastrophic earthquake measuring over 8.5 on the Richter scale struck near Mumbai in early April. With tremors felt from as far away as New Delhi and beyond, thousands of individuals were left injured or homeless amidst this natural calamity that has put immense strain on India's resources.

The quake hit just before dawn on the 5th when many people slept in their homes unaware of an impending disaster lurking beneath them. The tremors, which lasted for several minutes causing widespde havoc and devastation to infrastructure across Maharashtra state – India's economic enginehouse- were felt miles away from the epicenter in cities as far off as Kolkata on the eastern coast of the country.

"This is beyond anything we could have prepared for," said Dr Rajesh Kumar, a seismologist at Mumbai University who has been monitoring tremors across India's eastward-stretching plate boundary which skirts along its northeastern border with Myanmar and Bangladesh. He continued to state that this is the worst earthquake in over 50 years, causing significant damage not only at ground level but also beneath oceans creating dangerous tsunami waves hitting India's eastern coastlines as well.

The Indian government declared a complete lockdown of Mumbai immediately after reports surfaced about possible casualties and extensive property loss across the city that houses over 20 million people within its administrative boundaries. The state capital, Pune too felt significant tremors along with other parts in central India as well - highlighting just how far-reaching this seismic event has been.

In a grim reminder of nature's power to upend human lives and livelihoods at will; the death toll began rising rapidly within hours after the quake struck, reaching over 10 by late morning on April fifth alone according to local officials who are still recovering bodies amidst destruction caused primarily in urban areas like Thane district which is located just north of Mumbai.

As international aid begins pouring into India's most disaster-hit cities from various countries including China, Japan and Australia among others seeking immediate humanitarian relief; local officials are grappling with issues ranging from providing shelter for displaced families staying in camps or temporary shelters built hastily by NGO groups working relentlessly on the ground.

Meanwhile medical professionals across hospitals state they have seen a rise in casualties suffering physical injuries like crushed bones and fractures as well psychological trauma due to loss of loved ones or properties; many fear that mental health issues stemming from this disaster will haunt survivors for years. 

India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged government support during an evening national address on television where he promised massive reconstruction efforts backed up by financial assistance packages which aim to rebuild affected areas and provide medical aid along with psychological counseling services needed urgently across several regions including Mumbai.

In a move that has drawn international praise; countries worldwide have come forward offering emergency relief supplies like food, water purifiers & medicines among other essentials while local citizens from various states and even neighboring Bangladesh are pitching in by donating funds or items towards
