Hurricane Irene made landfall near Jacksonville, Florida, late Sunday night as a Category 1 hurricane with sustained wind speeds of up to 74 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC). The storm is expected to weaken over North Carolina before moving into southern New England by Tuesday.

Evacuation orders have been issued for residents living in coastal regions such as St. Mary's County and Dare County as Irene approaches, CNN reports based on official advisories from local authorities like the State Emergency Services (SES). Experts estimate around 10% of homes could be impacted by flooding if rainfall reaches up to three inches per hour during peak intensity.

"It'ries crucial that we remain vigilant and prepare for Irene as a strong storm," said Florida Governor, Jeb Bush. "The potential damage is serious but avoidable with sufficient preparation." 

In response, SES has deployed rescue teams across the state to assist in evacuations, emergency sheltering, food distribution points, power restoration efforts and infrastructure protection measures along affected areas while closely monitoring storm progression towards other states. The National Weather Service forecasts possible wind gusts of up to 95 mph as Irene passes through Cape Hatteras on Monday afternoon before weakening inland.

"I can't stress enough how important it is for residents who live along our coastline or plan any travel into impacted areas this weekend," said Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) director, Kathleen Sebelius during a press conference Sunday morning from her headquarters at the National Hurricane Center. "We will continue providing aid and resources to communities affected by Irene."

Scientists believe warmer ocean temperatures due to global climate change might intensify hurricanes like Irene, causing them to maintain or increase strength before landfall instead of weakening as they historically have done after reaching shore. "Climate models predict stronger storms than in the past," said Dr. Bill Murray from NOAA's Climate Prediction Center during an interview yesterday afternoon at Miami University where he presented research findings on sea surface temperatures and hurricanes this season so far, per WFTV 9 News report shared by CNN International today morning through their world feed in Europe via a video-only link. "While we're still refining our understanding of how climate change may affect specific storm events like Irene directly impacting the eastern seabo018kf3d2a4, it is evident that sea surface temperatures play an important role."

Local business owners along coastal regions expressed concern over potential damage to their properties if flooding occurs. "I just hope our buildings won't be affected too much," said Mary Ann Jones who runs a bed and breakfast in St. Augustine near the Atlantic Ocean shoreline where tourists often visit during peak season, as quoted by CNN Tuesday morning on Facebook Live streamed from her establishment for live updates provided to guests staying there before evacuation orders were issued throughout their township starting late Sunday night per SES directives based out of Jacksonville's Emergency Operations Center.

Emergency crews continue working tirelessly through early Tuesday morning along the Florida coastline, with reports indicating no major injuries have been sustained thus far among residents and tourists alike despite some minor property damage caused by strong waves
