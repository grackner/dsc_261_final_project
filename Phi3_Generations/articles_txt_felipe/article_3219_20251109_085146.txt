A massive refugee camp in northern Jordan has experienced a devastating fire that displaced thousands of people just days before winter sets in, officials confirmed Thursday morning. The blaze at the Za'atri Camp began late Wednesday night near Kufur Anma and is said to be one of the largest fires recorded this season.

Jordanian authorities estimate over 70,000 Syrian refugees were living in the camp before flames tore through their shelters around midnight local time last Wednesday. Many residents have been forced outside into makeshift tents and sleeping bags as they await further aid from relief organizations after emergency services battled to control the fire, which is thought to be caused by faulty electrical wiring within a tent complex housing dozens of families in close quarters.

"This has been an unprecedented tragedy for these people who already have suffered so much," said Abdullah Al-Ashtat, Jordan's deputy prime minister and interior minister overseeing refugee affairs during a press conference at the camp Thursday morning with top military officials. "We are working around the clock to provide them immediate relief in this critical time."

Authorities have issued evacuation orders for all of Za'atri, warning that temperatures below freezing could cause additional problems as snow is forecast overnight and into Friday. The United Nations estimates about 860,000 Syrian refugees now reside within Jordanian borders with approximately half living in urban areas like Amman or Irbid while the remainder are situated across more than a dozen camps including Za'atri near Mafraq on the Iraqi border.

A UNHCR representative said aid efforts were underway but cautioned that delivering necessary supplies amid widespread reports of looting and other criminal activity inside camp could present logistical challenges: "We are coordinating with partners to ensure essential relief items like blankets, tents, water heaters for hot drinks reach those who need it most. As we work together on this difficult situation, the international community must not forget these people in crisis."

Syrian refugee Mohammad Banaf says his family's tent collapsed under intense heat and that they were forced outside into frigid temperatures as he sought shelter inside a local church. "We have nothing left but our clothes on us, the fire destroyed everything," said the father of four from Aleppo who fled war-torn Syria two years ago with his wife Fatima, son Omar and daughters Aisha and Layla at Za'atri Camp after finding safety within Jordanian borders.

"We are grateful for our saviors here in Mafraq as well the kind people providing warmth until help arrives," he added before turning to his children who have been told not to sleep outdoors due to fears of freezing overnight temperatures dropping near -20 degrees Celsius.

A local firefighter at Za'atri Camp, Mohammad Ali, says the blaze started after an electrical issue in a tent housing multiple families became uncontrolled and spread throughout their communal living quarters before breaking out into neighboring tents where it quickly consumed everything within its path: "We fought valiantly to contain this fire which raged on for hours but sadly our limited resources were simply not enough against such an enormous inferno.
