A recent travel advisory has led to a significant drop in tourism for Greece's popular islands as concerns over safety have escalated following last weekend’ enduring volcanic activity on the nearby island of Santorini. As per officials, thousands flocked from mainland Greece and neighboring countries during their summer holiday season, with numbers soaring to an estimated 50,000 visitors before this month's unrestful events that forced authorities to declare a temporary travel restriction for all non-residents starting on Tuesday.

Experts have warned of the increased risk following sporadic ash falls and seismic tremors across multiple areas around Santorini, with local hotels experiencing an abrupt 80% decline in guests since Monday's report issued by Greece’s National Observatory for Seismology. "The recent volcanic activity has undeniably impacted the island of tourist magnet-Santorini," remarked Dr. Eleni Georgiou, a leading geologist based at Athens University who was not immediately available during this time due to emergency meetings with government officials discussing safety measures and evacuation plans for locals in risk zones around volcanic hotspots across Greece.

In light of the current situation on Santorini island, tourist authorities are urging residents there—and other Greek islands as well—to exercise extreme caution while traveling between these picturesque destinations amidst concerns about aftershocks and potential ash fallouts that could result in respiratory issues among non-inhabitants.

A 45-year-old British tourist, Sarah Smith from Manchester who was vacationing on Santorini with her family this month said she felt "anxious" but decided not to return home for the sake of their two young children’s experience. “We understand it isn't ideal; we know there are risks involved,” Ms. Smith, speaking at an information desk where officials offered real-time updates on volcanic activity and safety precautions in place explained her thought process as they all arrived to evacuate from the island of Santorini yesterday afternoon with a bag full only what essentials would fit into their two small backpacks.

However, not everyone agrees that tourists should continue traveling amidst these risks and have been urged by local Greek officials on Thursday evening to stay put until after the volcano situation has stabilized—as per an emergency press conference held at the Athens Hilton Hotel this afternoon where Greece's Minister of Tourism, Christina Panayiotopoulou delivered a stern warning that tourists should not travel or risk losing their reservations altogether. "This is unprecedented in recent history," Ms. Panayiotopoulou stressed at the press conference as she announced an immediate halt to all international flights and ferries from Thursday through next Monday, while Greek domestic tourism remains open with additional safety measures implemented across transportation hubs on affected islands where a temporary shutdown of activities has been enacted by local municipal councils.

"It's not worth risking your lives for the sake of travel," Ms. Panayiotopoulou concluded, after which her statement was echoed in agreement with several council members representing different island governments attending to various concerns about how prolonged disrufort and limited resources could impact their already fragile economy while reeling from last month's devast
