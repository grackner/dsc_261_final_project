Athletes at Tokyo Olympic Games feel a mix of adrenaline and nervous anticipation ahead of their opening ceremony tonight as they prepare to showcase months of training in front of an international audience. With the event set for July 23rd, competitors from around the world have been making final preparations with hopes high but expectations tempered by understandable nerves.

In a conversation yesterday at Kasumigaseki Grand Hotel where they stay during their Olympic stays, American gymnast Simone Biles expressed her readiness and resolve: "Every time I step onto that mat in Tokyo, it's not just about personal accomplishment; it’s also representing my country on such an esteemed global platform. However, today is nerve-wracking."

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has announced the final list of 120 athletes set to compete in Tokyo after a rigorous selection process where each one demonstrated outstanding skills and personal bests throughout their careers thus far: "These are some of the finest competitors we've ever seen, with performances that have brought our nation national pride," said IOC member Yoko Honda.

Amidst preparations for a historic Olympics amid global challenges including COVID-19 restrictions and geopolitical tensions is an unwavering spirit of resilience embodied by these athletes, who arrive in Tokyo after months away from home: "The last few days have been about bracing myself mentally before stepping into the world stage," added British swimmer Adam Peaty.

Sports officials are reminding competitors and spectators alike of their shared respect for each other despite differing nationalities as Japan continues to roll out its comprehensive COVID-19 protocols alongside heightened security measures: "Our primary focus is the health, safety, and wellbeing of everyone involved," said Tokyo Olympic chief executive Tsunemori Kondoh.

As anticipation builds throughout these final days before opening ceremony begins with a spectacular performance by global superstar Shaun White in Park Hyuga Water Sports Field at Yokahama Stadium: "It's time for the world to witness athleticism, grace and determination like never before," said World Snowboarding champion Daina Gillaspie.

Olympics organizers have announced a record number of 39 sports categories that run from July 24th until August 9th across seven National Olympic Committees (NOCs): China, United States, Japan, Australia, Canada, Great Britain and France with each country bringing their own unique representation in terms of medal contenders.

With Tokyo as the backdrop for an unparalleled global sporting spectacle that also carries profound significance given its status as a host city aimed at rebuilding from natural disasters only 16 years ago, these athletes are ready to make their mark in history: "We're all here because of the support we receive. It’s our job now to deliver and show what Tokyo Olympics truly stands for," said French badminton player Mathieu Choblet while packing his gear at Haneda Airport earlier this week as he prepared for action on Japan's shores, where spectators are equally ready: "The excitement is palpable. We’re all here to share in the energy of these Olympic Games," said local resident Yoko Suzuki last month during a news conference organized by IOC ahead of Tokyo
