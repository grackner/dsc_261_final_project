A massive typhoon has left thousands homeless in Southeast Asian countries including Vietnam and the Philippines as it barrelled through the region this past weekend. Heavy rains have caused flooding that cut off access to some communities, leaving many without food or clean water for days. As of Tuesday morning, officials estimate upwards of 50 lives may be lost due to the storm and its aftermath while over a hundred individuals are confirmed missing.

Typhoon "Onyx" struck hardest in Vietnam on Saturday afternoon when it hit land at full force with sustained wind speeds surpassing hurricane-force standards, according to local meteorological agencies reporting backed by satellite imagery and ground assessments from international aid organizations monitoring the situation.

The storm system developed rapidly over water before hitting South Vietnamese coastal areas late Saturday morning — causing widespin flooding that quickly inundated lowlands throughout central provinces, including An Giang, Dong Thap, Lai Chau and Tuy Hoang as per officials' early estimates. By evening the storm had weakened slightly to Category 1 strength but remained dangerous enough for authorities across three countries — Vietnam (where it first struck), Cambodia, and finally Malaysia where its remnants were expected next —to declare states of emergency while aid began pouring in on both national and international levels.

"This is the most powerful typhoon we have seen this season," said Dr. Hai Kim Thanh, meteorologist with Ho Chi Minh City's National University who had tracked Onyx throughout its development across multiple countries before landing onshore Vietnamese soil under heavy clouds and rain bands Friday night local time (noon Saturday ET). "The rains have been intense since landfall. We saw flooding that was almost biblical in some areas with depths of several feet, forcing us to call for international assistance just days into this season."

Drinking water shortages are already becoming acute throughout the affected regions despite ongoing distribution efforts led by national governments and non-governmental organizations like Doctors Without Borders. Food deliveries have also been hampered due not only to damaged infrastructure but supply chain disruptions resulting from port closures caused directly or indirectly through weather events, as well as social distancing measures implemented across the affected area following concerns over COVID-19 transmission risk among vulnerable groups residing in flooded areas.

"The situation is critical," said UNICEF Representative John McArdle during a press conference today from Saigon where he and other aid representatives are awaiting clearance to deploy into the most impacted zones across Vietnam's Red River delta region which includes provinces such as An Giang, Ho Chi Minh City (formerly known by its colonial name Saigon), Dong Thap and Tuy Hoang. "We need more hands on deck before long term aid reaches these communities."

With Typhoon Onyx's remnants expected to impact Malaysia later this week, authorities continue working around-the clock in Vietnamese provinces already devastated by flooding as well throughout Cambodia and southern Thailand where preparations are underway for its arrival. The storm system has claimed thousands of lives over the last few days alone while disrupting transportation networks along coastal regions across Asia with millions caught unprepared without access to food, water or shelter before evacuating their homes when floodwaters rose quickly in low-lying
