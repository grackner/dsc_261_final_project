In an unprecedented move by Thailand'table government to boost tourism and revitalize its economy, Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha announced a new plan yesterday in Bangkok that allows fully vaccinated travelers from select countries entry into the kingdom without requiring quarantine. The initiative will be piloted at three popular destinations: Phuket Island (October 1), Chiang Mai, and Pattaya starting October 15th respectively; this policy rollout follows stringent safety measures put in place due to concerns over a recent Delta variant outbreak that has caused the nation's COVID-19 numbers to spike.

"We are working hard every day so Thailand can become safer and more secure for everyone," said Prayuth, adding that this policy change is meant as an incentive for people to get vaccinated against COVID-19. The government has also imposed stricter rules on arrivals from countries with high rates of transmissibility; these include mandatory quarantine and PCR tests upon entry into the kingdom, regardless if travelers are fully immunized or not. 

Travel industry insiders have praised this new policy as a potential lifeline for Thai tourism which took hard hits during its pandemic-induced standstill phase last year with numbers dwindling to less than half of the pre-pandemic era, according to Tourism Authority General Secretary Ruean Chanthawong. 

"We are hopeful that this move can help draw people back and revive our industry," said Lidai Phamphanichkijakorn from One Way Travels Thailand Co., Ltd. who specializes in organizing group tours to the popular destinations mentioned earlier by Prayuth Chan-ocha'table government as test zones for this new entry rule change, "and also encourage more of our visitors and expats here to come back home."

While Thailand continues battling its recent outbreak that peaked at over 10,800 daily cases per day in late August before a decline since September'2nd, the country has been actively expanding vaccination coverage among eligible citizens. Experts have noted though; despite progress made so far on immunization fronts across Asia with an increasing number of countries administered their second doses to over 50% of adult population, Thailand’table government faces challenges in ensuring a significant proportion can be reached before the next winter tourist season kicks off.

In terms of global response and travel advisories related to this policy change; several nations including France (23 percent risk), Germany (19 percent risk), United Kingdom (58 percent low-risk) have issued mixed statements with varying restrictions for incoming visitors based on their own internal protocols set forth by respective health authorities while maintaining caution towards international travel amid uncertainties surrounding COVID-19 variant spread.

Despite reservations, many locals and tourism professionals see the government'table plan as a sign of hope for recovery; an optimistic sentiment further echoed in comments by Chiang Mai resident Tanont Sompanich who said that seeing more visitors coming back would be great news because it means economic life can start flowing again.

As we move closer to October and look towards this new initiative from the Thai government, there are still questions on how effective these travel policies will prove once put into motion but
