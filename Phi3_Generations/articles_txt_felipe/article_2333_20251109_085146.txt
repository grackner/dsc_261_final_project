In a significant blow to global e-commerce giant Amazon's dominance in online retailing within Southeast Asia, smaller competitor Lazada has taken over an additional $3 billion market share from its rival since the start of this year. Experts believe that with this latest win for Singapore-based company, it could become a formidable force to reckon with on international grounds as well in upcoming years if current growth trends continue unchecked.

Southeast Asia - In an unexpected twist within Southeast Asian e-commerce industry last weekend, the local market share of online retailer Lazada overtoth Amazon has seen a considerable shift towards larger proportions with news that it had gained another $3 billion since January 2021. "This is very good for us and bad for our competitors like Amazon as well," said Ravi Singh, CEO at one of the leading Southeast Asian startups which recently partnered with Lazada to launch its platform in this region last year but now operates independently under a new name, 'TechShopper'. 

He shared that TechShop's partnership was originally intended as an Amazon alternative for local small and medium businesses struggling during the COVID-19 pandemic which led to their significant growth by providing unique products at competitive prices.

According to a recent report by Statista, Lazada held approximately 25% of total market share within e-commerce retail in the region with Amazon trailing close behind at around 18%. In addition to Southeast Asian startups and local businesses like TechShopper gaining momentum overseas too as well thanks largely attributed towards a shift by consumers across other continents who have grown increasingly more conscious about supporting locally-made products since the beginning of this decade while simultaneously becoming less satisfied with foreign imports due to issues such as environmental impacts, labor rights abuses or quality control among others. This has provided small and medium enterprises an additional platform for growth via international eCommerce giants in recent years which have proven vital during uncertain economic times like those brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic while also being key drivers of innovation at their respective domestic markets as they continue to expand globally through partnerships with established players such as Amazon.

Despite growing successes, however experts warn that these trends alone cannot guarantee continued dominance over foreign giants indefinitely since consumer
