As a powerful cyclone lashed parts of Eastern India on Monday night into Tuesday morning with wind speeds exceeding hurricane levels and causing widespdeal flooding, authorities are ramping up relief efforts in the hardest-hit areas near Kolkata. The low-lying coastal region witnessed record rainfall since cyclone Buland struck back on 15 August last year, an event that remains unparalleled in recent times for such a calamitous occurrence within days of one another in this part of the country.


Senior meteorologists confirmed that Cyclone 'Kavya' formed over Sunday night and intensified rapidly as it made landfall yesterday near West Bengal's Purulia district, bringing torrential downpours across at least four districts before moving northeast towards Bihar province where more rainfall is predicted. Over 50 fatalities have been reported so far from the ensuing floods and widespread displacement of thousands in already affected villages such as Kokapur, Mousundi, Kalua, Suriandih, Saralpara among others - with many still missing presumed swept away by raging waters.


"The sheer force this cyclone has unleashed upon the region is beyond words," said Dr Naresh Kumar Devdas, Director of Meteorology for West Bengal State Government during a briefing held in Kolkata today morning. "We're witnessing weather extremities at an alarmingly frequent pace and our disaster management strategies must adapt to mitigate the mounting risks posed by such calamitous events."


Local officials are on high alert, coordinating rescue operations with state police force, armed forces, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international aid groups. The Kolkata Municipal Corporation Chief Mridul Goswami announced a public appeal for donations to provide immediate relief essentials such as food supplies and blankets while also setting up temporary shelters across the city's community centers, schools, malls, auditoriums among other indoor spaces. "Our priority is saving lives," said Mridul Goswamy during an evacuation drive led by fire brigade teams in affected villages where over 20-30% of homes are submerged under water up to four feet deep - a situation he described as the worst after cyclone Amphan struck last year.


While relief efforts continue, scientists warn that this is likely not an isolated event with many similarities in patterns between cyclones Buland and Kavya which seem to be recurrent every two years now according to Dr Sunita Babi from Indian Meteorological Department based out of Kolkata's Regional Research Laboratory. "It seems we are experienre witnessing the increasing frequency, intensity, and landfall proximity with such cyclone systems - an ominous trend which is being observed globally due to climate change," Dr Sunita Babi shared in her latest study on 'Cyclonic Activity Over Eastern India.'


In neighboring Odisha province where the impact has been felt lesser, authorities are preparing for possible evacuations as heavy rains and wind speeds of up to 120 kmph continue across several districts. Local Disaster Management Authority Chief Ramesh Dutta reported that so far only one fatality was recorded in these areas with significant damage caused mainly due to landslides rather
