In Los Angeles yesterday afternoon, supermodel Gisele Bundchen celebrated her engagement to actor Tom Hanks in a glamorous ceremony at Malibu's historic Hollywood Hotel and Resort. The pair exchanged vows surrounded by their closest friends and family on the resort'seloft of emerald-colored hills overlooking the Pacific Ocean, creating stunning natural backdrops for what many call an idyllic celebration under California sunshine.

Bundchen revealed she proposed to Hanks last month during a romantic getaway in Tuscany when he accepted her hand after months of courtship that began while they were on the set together filming "The Water Man" back in 2019. She shared, “Tom has been my rock for years now, and I wanted to share this life with him under our own Californian sky.”

Hanks commented before the wedding ceremony started saying, “Gisele is not only a fantastic actress but also an incredible person who brings joy wherever she goes. Today marks one of many beautiful chapters in my journey alongside her." He added that he's "thrilled to finally call Gisele his wife" and shared optimism about their future together, saying they have been blessed with common goals and values which make them an incredible team both personally and professionally.

Experts believe Bundchen and Hanks are a match made in heaven - as it seems so for this Hollywood couple who first met on set at Universal Studios back when she was just starting her modeling career while he had already established himself with years of acting experience under his belt, including the Oscar-winning role in "Philadelphia."

The union marks a significant milestone as Bundchen continues to break barriers and inspire millions around the world. Her unwavering commitment toward social causes like climate change advocacy has brought her into new circles of influence - alongside being one of Instagram’s most followed figures, she actively supports various charitable organizations promoting environmental conservation efforts globally while maintaining a balance between work and activism-life choices.

Hanks' upcoming projects include "A Man Called Ove" in Sweden with Colin Farrell set to start shooting later this year that will allow him time for the couple’s honeymoon plans before they embark on their next big project together – rumored as an A-list indie film exploring love amidst adversity.

Friends and fans shared heartfelt reactions expressing excitement, while some social media influencers even created wedding hashtags in Bundchen's honor to spread the joy of this fairytale union further across platforms worldwide – proving yet again why Gisele remains a shining star wherever she goes!

Gisele and Tom Hanks now look forward with hope as they begin building their family together, celebrating an unforgettable love story that started on the set of "The Water Man" nearly two years ago while filming in Italy. Bundchen plans to have children soon after her honeymoon period ends which will bring more joy into Hanks' heart and make for many memorable moments shared between this Hollywood power couple who continues to prove love knows no boundaries!

In the meantime, fans eagerly await details about their personal life as Gisele Bundchen prepares herself not only professionally but also emotionally after such a significant event in her journey.
