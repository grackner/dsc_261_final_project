In a statement attributed to President Muhammadu Buhari at his official residence in Abuja on Thursday afternoon prior to the demonstration: "The Nigerian government remains resolute and steadfast against any form of violence that threatens our national unity. We are working tirelessly with international partners towards sustainable peace (Office for Foreign Responses, 2023)."

It is our duty to ensure justice for all (Sarah Thompson, Human Rights Advocate)."
