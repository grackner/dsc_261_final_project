A massive wildfire currently engulfing parts of California has forced thousands to evacuate and left millions under an air quality alert since it started on Monday near San Bernardino County's Cajon Pass as a result of lightning strikes during the dry season. As of Tuesday, over 500 firefighters have been battling fierce wind conditions that are fanning flames across rugged terrain to contain and extinguish the blaze before it can threaten more communities or natural resources ahead of peak tourist seasons starting in June.

The inferno has already destroyed several structures but fortunately, no lives have been lost due to prompt evacuation orders following emergency services' initial response late on Monday evening when first responders received the wildfire report at 9 p.m. PDT near Etiwanda Road and East Avenue in Cajon Junction—a popular area for tourists heading between Los Angeles and Las Vegas, given its proximity to Interstate 15 and Lake Hemacrew state park nearby (elevation around 300 feet).

California Department of Forestry & Fire Protection spokesperson John Cox stated that the fire is one of multiple wildfires ongoing across different counties. "With a dry summer ahead, it's imperative to stay vigilant and follow all safety precautions," he said during an evening press conference Tuesday afternoon at Los Alamitos Fire Station Number One in San Bernardino County, near where the blaze is raging—and which Cox called "a critical area due not only for its residential populations but also tourists passing through en route to other attractions such as Joshua Tree National Park."

The dry lightning season has led officials across several California counties including Riverside County, San Bernardino County and Orange County—already grappling with the impacts of an unprecedented three years worth of drought since 2017 —to issue pleas for residents to exercise extra caution as temperatures soar over triple digits. "We cannot afford any missteps this year; Mother Nature has proven unforgiving, and our resilience depends on everyone's cooperation," Riverside County Fire Chief Mark Brayden told the press last weekend after a series of brush fires had already broken out across parts surrounding Lake Elsinore (elevation 1250 feet).

California's 10-year average temperature in June stands at a balmy 75 degrees Fahrenheit with the highest historical jumps recorded around July of just over ten degrees—a significant spike when coupled together; this year alone has already seen increases surpassing that mark by nearly six percent. "We're monitoring climate data closely, hoping for cooler days ahead while preparing all possible measures to ensure public safety," said State Fire
