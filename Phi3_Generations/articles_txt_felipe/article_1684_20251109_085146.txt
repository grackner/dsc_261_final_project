Damon Taylor's record-breaking touchdown run for Kansas City Chiefs sets NFL history as they clinch playoff berth against Denver Broncos on Thursday night at Arrowhead Stadium in a thrilling finish to their regular season (KC, Nov. 25). Damon Taylor ran an astonishing 148 yards through the entirety of Oakland's defense before being corralled by Chiefs defenders near midfield as time expired on the final play — just shy of setting a franchise record for longest touchdown run in NFL history. The previous record was held by running back LenDale White, who set it against Dallas during Week 15 at Arrowhead Stadium two years prior to this memorable night; his impressive outing spanned an unparalleled 276 yards on nine carries as the Chiefs secured a victory in overtime.

In what could be considered one of the most remarkable plays witnessed throughout last season, Damon Taylor was called into action late in Thursday's game when Kansas City had fallen behind by four touchdown points to Denver Broncos at 16-20 (KC score). With mere minutes remaining before time would expire on his final possession — a critical moment that could determine the fate of their season, he was handed off from quarterback Patrick Mahomes and charged with reviving what seemed like an all but lost game.

"Damon ran 148 yards for me; it felt surreal to be leading this kind of play in such a crucial moment," Chiefs linebacker Pat Simmons commented afterwards, still brimming with excitement from the night's pivotal events as they wrapped up their regular season. "But I think most importantly what we accomplished was more significant than just breaking his own record; this team showed true resilience and character today."

The Chiefs have been making headlines for months, having made it to an AFC Championship Game appearance in five of the last six seasons as they battled through numerous obstacles en route. Last season's journey was no different — after starting 4-2 following a Week 3 blowout loss against rival Oakland Raiders (7:50pm ET, KC Arrowhead), their path to redemption saw them win every game since except one as they cruised into the playoffs by late January.

But while this year'ranned run has brought Kansas City success on numerous occasions and solidified players like Damon Taylor (19-year veteran) among fan favorites, many are also left in awe of his extraordinary 2023 touchdown feat — especially given that it occurred just one day after he suffered from severe ankle injuries during last season's playoff loss against the Las Vegas Raiders.

"Damon has this ability to always find something meaningful in every opportunity," Kansas City head coach Andy Reid expressed at a press conference following Thursday night's game, emphasizing his impact on team dynamics as well as statistics and records along with acknowledging Taylor's remarkable talent for bringing positivity into high-pressure situations. "His resilience inspires us daily — we know he'll come back from any injury."

Indeed Damon is set to miss the first two weeks of training camp due to his ankle, but both coach and Taylor himself have pledged commitment as they gear up for another challenge-filled
