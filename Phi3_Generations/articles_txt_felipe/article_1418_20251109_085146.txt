In a groundbrethy move for sustainable investment within the Asia-Pacific region, green energy giant SolarisPower has just closed on an unprecedented $25 billion funding round led by international hedge funds and backed heavily with institutional money. The deal comes as countries around the globe ramp up efforts to combat climate change through investment in clean technology companies.

SolarisPower, headquartered at One Sun Plaza on 3rd Avenue in Sydney's affluent business district of Surry Hills - Australia’s bustling renewable energy hub- announced the close yesterday after a competitive funding process that attracted global investors. The company is set to use these funds primarily for expanding into emerging Asian markets and rolling out its cutting edge solar technology at scale within those countries, including South Korea, India and China - Asia's leading economies where demand for renewable energy sources are rapidly increasing due in part of the governments’ commitment towards achieving a net-zero economy by 2050.

“We believe this funding round will not only catapult SolarisPower to become one of the most significant players within Asia but also accelerate our plans for global expansion,” said John Doe, CEO of SolarisPower in an official statement yesterday afternoon . “The world needs more companies like us that are dedicated to combatting climate change through innovative and clean technologies.”

SolarisPower has been operating since 2015 but the funding round represents its biggest investment yet. The company, which focuses on producing efficient solar panels along with energy storage systems designed specifically for Asian market needs - was founded by a team of seasoned experts in renewable energy development and engineering who have worked at leading global firms like SunPower Corp., First Solar Inc., Siemens AG to launch the ambitious venture.

The round drew interest from international hedge funds, including private equity giants BlackRock Ltd. and State Street Corporation - which together accounted for more than $10 billion of the funding – as well as other institutions such as sovereign wealth funds or pension funds like Singapore’s GIC Pte Limited who have been increasingly venturing into renewable energy sector investments in recent years .

SolarisPower, which has raised capital through several rounds with previous investors including Temasek Holdings - the private equity arm of the Government of Singapore and its sovereign wealth fund that invests globally across industries – will use these funds for expanding research teams to develop proprietary advanced solar cells in partnership with local universities, launch more than 20 new pilot projects within three countries by Q3 next year as well as construct the first Asian commercial-scale production facility.

"We are excited about this funding round and look forward towards realizing our mission of delivering world-class renewable energy solutions to billions across Asia, a market which continues growing at an impressive pace,” added Jane Smithson, Head of Investor Relations for SolarisPower . "With these funds in hand we will not only expand within Asian markets but also continue enhancing our technologies and drive towards creating the greenest power industry out there."

The funding round comes as many countries are accelerating their plans to combat climate change. The Asia Pacific region alone is expected to contribute over half of all new energy investment worldwide by 2025, with a projected
