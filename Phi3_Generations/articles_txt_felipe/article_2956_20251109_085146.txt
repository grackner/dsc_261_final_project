Boston Celtics' star player suffered a season-ending injury in Thursday night matchup against the Atlanta Hawks at TD Garden. The team's superstar guard went down with two minutes and twenty seconds remaining, as he collided hard into one of his opponents while going for an offensive rebound. This will likely have significant implications on Boston Celtics’ performance moving forward in this year'selite NBA playoffs run-up against the top teams from each conference seeking to advance toward their respective Conference Finals matchups, a pivotal point before claiming another championship title or facing elimination if they falter.

BOSTON (CNN) — Boston Celtics star Paul Pierce had his season abruptly cut short in the team's Thursday night game against Atlanta Hawks at TD Garden, just minutes from a potential playoff berth with both teams vying for home court advantage as they approach their division final matchups.

“I was trying to go up on that and grab it when he grabbed me really hard,” said Pierce during post-game interviews. “Next thing I know, the pain is unbearable.” 
The season's leading scorer for Boston went down with two minutes twenty seconds left in regulation at TD Garden after colliding headfirst into an opponent while trying to secure a rebound near midcourt during the second half Thursday. Celtics team doctor Dr. John Miller immediately had him removed from play as he clutched his neck, leading coach Doc Rivers and assistant Dave Joenson quickly following suit in pulling their star forward out of this evening's loss to Atlanta Hawks (53-84).

The injury has raised serious concerns over Pierce’s chances for continued success with the Celtics after he scored an impressive 19 points, including crucial free throws as time expired in last night’s regular season opener against New York Knicks. “It's been a tough situation,” said NBA Commissioner Adam Silver following today’s game and Pierce announcing his injury status via Twitter post-match interview along with Boston Celtics President Danny Ainge, who also confirmed the severity of damage done to their star guard this evening in an unexpected loss. 
“He will need extensive evaluation first before anything can be determined,” he stated while urging for a quick and full recovery on behalf of Pierce’s wellbeing with hopes that his playing days are not over just yet despite recent health scares due to concussion problems from prior seasons last year where injuries forced him onto the bench more often in games.
 
Celtics guard Paul “Big Baby” Pierce was seen on crutches as he exited TD Garden after being removed following Thursday night’s loss against Atlanta Hawks due to a severe neck injury sustained when colliding headfirst during rebound attempt midway through the fourth quarter. Citing no immediate plans for surgery yet, team doctors reported that Pierce will need time off as he recuperates and assesses his future prospects after being inactive since last fall’s postseason playoffs run-up where they lost to Golden State Warriors during conference final matchups; both players had issues with injuries throughout entire regular season leading into this year's divisional series that put Boston Celtics up against New York Knicks alongside Atlanta Hawks along side Miami Heat who are currently at the top of standings in
