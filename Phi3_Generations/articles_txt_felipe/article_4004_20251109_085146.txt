A small plane carrying members of a British royal family is believed to have gone missing over Scotland last night as it attempted to land at Edinburgh Castle amid heavy fog conditions that severely reduced visibility across the region. The pilot-independent search was immediately launched by local authorities following reports from eyewitnesses, including two officers who observed the aircraft's abrupt disappearance into a dense grey curtain of mist around 8 p.m. EST (5:00 pm GMT).

The missing chartered flight is carrying members of Queen Elizabeth II and her son Prince Charles to an event in Edinburgh scheduled for tomorrow morning, but it has since been confirmed that the royal party will be safe as all individuals on board are accounted for after being airlifted out by military helicopters. Scottish Air Accident Investigation Bureau experts have begun assessing aircraft wreckage and debris collected near Loch Fyne, where initial findings suggest potential technical issues with the plane's navigation system prior to its disappearance.

Early investigations point towards a possible instrument malfunction as one of several contributing factors in what has become an enigmatic aviation incident that caught many by surprise amidst unusually harsh winter weather sweeping across Scotland on Thursday evening. Edinburgh-based pilot James McAllister, who was scheduled to fly the day's first commercial passenger flight out from Glasgow before witnessing this unusual occurrence for himself said in a statement: "It felt like something wasn’t right as I watched that plane go down into the darkness...The fog just came upon us all of a sudden."

While visibility remains limited due to ongoing heavy snowfall and blizzard conditions across much of Scotland, search teams comprising members from RAF stations at Kinloss Barracks in Morayshire; Prestwick International Airport near Glasgow; St Mungo's Cathedral Priory where the royal guests will be staying overnight tonight ahead of tomorrow’s public event and military personnel continue their efforts to locate missing aircraft debris. Scottish Transport Minister John Swinney, speaking from Edinburgh Parliament on Thursday evening said: "Our thoughts are with all those affected by this incident - it is very worrying."

The United Kingdom's Air Accident Investigation Branch has been notified and experts in aviation safety will begin an immediate investigation into the circumstances leading up to the disappearance of the aircraft. Authorities have asked anyone who may have seen or heard anything unusual about flights coming into Edinburgh Airport between 7:30 p.m. EST (4:30 pm GMT) on Thursday until just after midnight Friday for information regarding this developing situation which has been met with a great deal of public concern and speculation across social media platforms as well as British newspapers including The Guardian, Daily Mail & Herald Express amongst others since early morning hours.

A spokesperson from the Scottish Government's Civil Aviation Authority is quoted today: "We take these incidents very seriously indeed...we will continue to cooperate fully with all investigations being carried out." While official statements remain cautiously optimistic about locating wreckage in relatively stable weather forecasted for tomorrow, residents across Loch Fyne and nearby communities express their frustration over the lack of timely information regarding this distressing situation impacting not only those directly involved but also innocent bystanders left feeling vulnerable.
