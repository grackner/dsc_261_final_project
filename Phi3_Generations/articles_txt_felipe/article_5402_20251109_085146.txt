A massive earthquake struck off the coast of Lagos, Nigeria, early Saturday morning, registering a magnitude of 7.1 on the Richter scale and causing widespdest panic across parts of Africa's largest city. The tremors were felt from Abuja to as far away as Cairo, with initial reports coming in just after midnight local time (UTC+1).

Survivor Michael Opara tells CNN that the quake was one of its kind: "I never thought I would feel anything like this again. It literally shook our entire city." The epicenter occurred about 50 miles offshore, near Port Harcourt—a major oil hub in neighboring Rivers State and not far from Lagos itself.

Emergency services were immediately deployed to the scene by Nigerian authorities as they received distress calls reporting structural damage throughout downtown areas of both cities combined. The tremors have forced thousands into makeshift shelters with barely enough space for their belongings, causing a severe strain on local resources already stretched thin due to escalating socio-economic issues and recent fuel shortages plaguing the region just months after devastating floods.

In an interview Monday morning (UTC+1), Dr. Chimamanda Emeka, seismologist at Lagos State University said: "This earthquake is a stark reminder of how vulnerable our infrastructure remains despite modern advancements." According to her research findings published last year in the Geological Society Journal Africa Quarterly Report on Tectonics (GJAQTR), she had warned that Nigeria's West African Cratonic area could experience significant seismic activity due to geologically active boundaries beneath it.

President Buhari and Foreign Minister Oluyemi Soyinka pledged national solidarity with a promise of comprehensive recovery efforts, while World Bank issued an emergency response fund for affected communities on Friday (UTC+1). Nigeria's Ministry of Interior confirmed the deployment of at least 50 rescue teams along critical routes to reach stranded citizens and provide essential services.

As days pass following this unprecedented natural disaster, many victims still rely on aid from international organizations like Red Cross while waiting for their homes or businesses repaired enough that they can return safely; some are even rebuilding entire communities in the camps near Lagos' Mile 6 station where life is slowly normalizing again.

Echoing sentiments heard throughout afflicted neighborhoods, Professor Bolaji Afolami said: "We will recover as a nation but we need more support - both physical and financial." He went on to emphasize the importance of building earthquake-resistant structures in line with modern engineering practices before another disaster strikes.

It's been just three days since this catastrophe rocked Nigeria, already dealing simultaneously with socioeconomic instability amid escalating fuel shortages and floods; yet again showing that Mother Nature remains unpredictable when it comes to Africa’s most populous country facing complex challenges on all fronts.
