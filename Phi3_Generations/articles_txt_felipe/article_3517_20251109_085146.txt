Topic: Health - Mindfulness

It was a regular Thursday afternoon when local librarian Margaret Thompson decided to introduce mindfulness sessions at her Greenwood Public Library in Springfield as an initiative for community wellbeing; starting May 15, these monthly gatherings were set up with the intent of reducing stress and improving mental health amongst residents.

"We've seen a rising interest in how our minds affect overall health," explained Thompson to The Daily News yesterday afternoon while setting up posters advertising this weekend’s session on mindfulness meditation techniques. "This program is about bringing tools that will help people manage their stress better, which ultimately leads to an improvement of physical and mental wellbeing."

Experts agree with Thompson's initiative as studies have shown a strong link between lower levels of chronic stress leading to improved health outcomes; according to Dr. Laura Simmons, lead psychologist at the Center for Mental Health Research in Springfield Medical University who has worked extensively on mindfulness-based interventions: "Research consistently indicates that individuals practicing regular meditation and mindfulness exercises can significantly reduce their anxiety levels."

For Thompson's first session, a diverse group of about 20 community members attended the event at Greenwood Library yesterday; with an hour dedicated to introducing participants to basic breathing techniques followed by discussions led by guest speaker John Carter - author and mindfulness coach. "It’s amazing how simple exercises like deep belly breathing can help calm our racing minds,” said local mother, Susan Garcia during the discussion break between sessions last Saturday afternoon.

Margaret Thompson is hopeful that these weekend gatherings will become a regular part of community life in Springfield; with plans to expand beyond her library and into schools and workplaces throughout town come fall 2023.
