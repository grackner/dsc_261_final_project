Topic: World - Middle East

In a remarkable feat of diplomacy and international cooperation, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu yesterday in Sharm El Sheikh for the first direct talks between Arab leaders from Israel'dearest foeand its primary regional rival since March 2016.

The historic meeting, taking place at a time of heightened tensions and escalating conflict across several fronts in the Middle East region - namely Syria, Yemen, Gaza Strip with Hamas militant factions operating from within Palestine'sdomeanings for many Arab nationsthat normal relations had been severed.

Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shukry told CNN that both countries agree to continue the negotiations at a high level in Cairo next month, where Egypt and Israel hope this time around - as their governments have not changed since 2016 –will provide better grounds for productive discussions.

"The world is watching us," Shukry said during an interview yesterday before leaving Washington to head back home after attending the annual US-Africa summit in Niamey, Nigeria's capital city where President Trump was scheduled to hold a one-on-one meeting with Egyptian counterpart Abdel Fattah el-Sisi on Wednesday. "This could mark an important turning point for peace and stability within the region."

The two leaders are expected to discuss various issues affecting both countries, including regional conflicts such as Syria's civil war which has spilled over into neighboring Lebanon since 2011; Yemenis crisis that erupted in early 2015 when Saudi Arabia and its allies launched military intervention against Shiite Houthi rebels backed by Iran - leading to a humanitarian disaster as hundreds of thousands are displaced or starving due to fighting along with an ongoing cholera outbreak.

The meeting comes days after the United Nations Security Council voted unanimously in favor of extending for another year its arms embargo and travel ban against Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, as well as three top military commanders: commander Ahmad Reza Ashtiani-Moghaddam, Rear Admiral Ali Fazeli Tavallaee; Chief of the Imperial Guard Yasuhiro Nagao. The resolution highlighted concerns about Iran's increasingly powerful missile and drone program with capabilities to strike targets in neighboring countries such as Iraq or Saudi Arabia while also threatening American interests at home via direct shipping links across Persian Gulf through the Strait of Hormuz, where more than 20 million barrels pass daily.

However, President Trump has since said he doesn't want to continue confrontation with Iran and believes diplomacy is possible despite previous threats made against his administration by Ayatollah Khamenei who threatened that America would regret their attempts at rapprochement between Israelis-Arabs after nearly a decade of war.

Egypt has been working hard towards improving ties with Washington, in particular since President Trump's visit to Cairo last year where he said "we see the sun coming out" and promised both countries could work together on regional issues including counterterrorism efforts against ISIS-like groups operating inside Syria as well other security threats plaguing Middle Eastern nations.
