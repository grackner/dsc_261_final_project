LOS ANGELES – The hunt for an elusive filmmaking legend in LA heats up as a mysterious new documentary promises to unveil never-before-seen footage of famed director Alfred Hitchcock, who passed away at the age of 86. "The Director's Shadow," which premiered yesterday evening on local cable channels nationwide with exclusive content filmed in his old Hollywood home and studio backlot near Sunset Boulevard before it was demolished decades ago is causing a stir among movie buffs, cinephiles, as well as historians and film industry veterans.

"I have never seen anything like this," said Marilyn Monroe biographer Richard Watts after attending the premiere in his hometown of Beverly Hills at Rodeo Drive's Paramount Theatre which hosted a sold-out screening with over 100 fans packed. "It feels almost eerie, to be honest."

The documentary claims that an anonymous assistant director had access and was able to secretively film Hitchcock during his regular office hours in the mid-50s – long before such technology became commonplace or easily obtainable elsewhere. The footage showcases intimate glimpses of the enigmstatic man's behind-the-scenes work, including a rare and unseen look at Hitchcock crafting iconic scenes that have enthralled audiences around the world for over seven decades – from masterful suspense thrillers like "Psycho" (1960) to poignant drama classics such as “Rear Window” and “North by Northwest.”

Cinema experts, historians, and Hitchcock's former crew members have been invited on a special viewing of the documentary this coming weekend at 1pm at Hollywood’s historic El Capitan Theatre. This exclusive screening comes two days after "The Director's Shadow" premiered online for subscribers to select streaming platforms and satellite TV providers as part of an innovative partnership with several entertainment companies specializing in movie archives, restoration services, and classic film retrospectives.

Melissa Greenwood, the assistant director depicted in "The Director's Shadow" commented on how her time working for Hitchcock was both inspiring but also somewhat intimidating: "It felt like you could sense his unparalleled genius as he worked - every scene a masterstroke."

While some have voiced concerns about potential copyright issues, the makers of this documentary emphasize that all materials presented are in the public domain or legally owned by Hitchcock's estate. As for what fans and historians hope to gain from "The Director's Shadow," they see it as an opportunity not just to pay tribute but also learn more about one of film history’s most influential directors, whose work continues resonate with audiences today.

As the Los Angeles community anticipates this revealing look behind Hitchcock's creative process and iconic body of work that has shaped modern cinema forevermore, many are also curious as to what secrets – both personal and professional - will be uncovered about a man who remains an enigma even after his passing.
