In an unexpected turn of events yesterday afternoon at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, a professional football game came to an abrupt halt when two teams simultaneously scored touchdown passes on consecutive plays starting with the second quarter's opening minute and continuing for seven straight minutes before halftime. The unprecedent sequence has left fans astounded as they witnessed history unfold during Saturday’s New York Giants vs. Dallas Cowboys game, which was aired live by NFL Network at 4:00 PM ET on September 25th.

According to ESPN reporter Jim Capraro who attended the match in person and interviewed some of those present during these unusual events, “The Giants’ head coach Jason Garrett had his teammates ready for a big game against Dallas as they aimed to clinch their first win since mid-July. However, things took an unforeseen turn when rookie wideout Michael Brown snatched the ball in midair and tossed it backward after receiving the snap.”

Intriguingly, this play prompted Dallas’ defensive linebacker Casey Jones to attempt a sack by leaping towards Garrett but ended up grabbing his own throw from receiver Allen Smith instead. “I saw him going for it and thought he might have gotten my quarterback," said fellow Cowboy Adam Doe, recalling the incident during an interview on Fox5NY's live blog post-game analysis show at 7:30 PM ET last night. "It took me a moment to realize that wasn’t happening.”

Meanwhile, Giants fans were ecstatic over this strange twist of fate while Cowboys supporters remained skeptical until the end result - both teams successfully completed touchdown passes on consecutive plays for seven minutes straight during the second quarter. “It's like watching a surreal movie scene,” said long-time New York Giants fan and retired linebacker, David O'Connor who attended MetLife Stadium along with his son but is now residing in California since 2015.

However, this strange occurrence has led to heated debates among sports experts about the legality of such a play which according to Sports Law expert and former NFL player John Roberts should have been ruled as an illegal forward pass due to its nature: "The Giants' defense had no intention or place for Brown’s ball, so how can you call it fair catch when he simply turns around in mid-air?”

At halftime bell ringing at 9:30 PM ET yesterday with the scoreboard reading NYG -14, DAL +26 after four quarters of play and two unconventional touchdowns by both teams during seven straight minutes which had left spectators in stunned silence throughout stadium-wide.

What comes next remains uncertain as league officials have yet to release any official statement on this strange sequence of events, but sources indicate that the NFL could consider a review or investigation into how and why such an incident occurred given its potential implications for game rules enforcement moving forward during live play at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.
