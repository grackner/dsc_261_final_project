Britain's New Parliament Building Unveiled in London on March 15th By James Smith and Elizabeth Green CNN Correspondents

LONDON - The United Kingdom unveiled its long-awaited new parliament building here today, with the ceremonial moment marking a significant symbolic milestone for democracy. HRH Prince Charles was in attendance as he watched his son, William, officially open the gleaming structure at noon on Parliament Hill in Westminster, London.

The former old Palace of Westminster will now make way to house history within its halls and continue serving modern parliamentary needs alongside the new edifice designed by esteemed architect Sir Daniel Foley. 1725 South Colonnade Avenue has become a place where tradition meets innovation, with Queen Elizabeth II having graced it only once before for her late husband's state funeral in 2decade-old history.

Speaking about the new building and its significance to British democracy, Prince Charles said: "The construction of this magnificent Parliament represents our nation’s commitment not just to preserve but also enhance how we serve as a parliamentary body for generations ahead." William nodded in agreement during his speech when he added with pride: “We honor and uphold the values that have been passed down through time.”

The stunning architectural marvel, consisting of four massive glass domes housing committees along three towering levels comes at a price tagged £840 million - one-fourth higher than originally estimated. However, these expenses will likely be recouped within five years by boosting tourist visits to the Parliament complex itself and through related educational activities in schools nationwide focusing on democracy as an important aspect of citizenship education since 2018 when this proposal was first discussed under Prime Minister Theresa May's government.

Official estimates project over one million international visitors annually once fully operational, creating new opportunities for cultural exchange while simultaneously providing a much-needed economic boost to London and surrounding areas in the long run as per Secretary of State Jeremy Hunt’s report issued last month stating: "We are confident that this investment will pay off through increased tourism revenue."

The unveiling also included various cultural activities celebrating British heritage; for instance, a brief display showcased period costumes worn by MPs during the 19th century. As they watched these sights unfolding before their eyes in fascinating detail on giant video screens placed strategically around Parliament Hill’s perimeter walls - echoes of history felt within stone-clad surroundings – representatives from across party lines joined together, emphasizing unity despite political differences while enjoying refreshments provided at designated tables set up along with the main ceremony.

The unveiling event was attended by dignitaries including HRH Prince Charles, who delivered opening remarks followed shortly after William’s inaugural speech that praised democracy as “one of our nation's most precious treasures.” Representatives from various parties also took turns to speak at the ceremony celebrating British heritage and unity before signing official documents into effect. As one senior MP remarked: "Today marks a new era for us all, filled with hopefulness about what lies ahead."

Reaction among local communities has been overwhelmingly positive; businesses along Parliament Hill have reported doubled revenues during past openings of similar scale since 2018
