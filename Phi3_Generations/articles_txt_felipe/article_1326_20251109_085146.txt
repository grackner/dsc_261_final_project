In a sweeping move to promote economic growth and security in South Asia, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India announced yesterday that his administration will be significantly increasing investment into renewable energy projects across the nation' endangered by rising pollution levels. The pledge was made as part of the ongoing United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27) held in Egypt and comes after years of criticism over slow progress towards environmental sustainability within India itself, one of only a handful countries globally still heavily reliant on coal for power generation; this change could not come sooner.
  
  As per reports from New Delhi dated October 30th - where the prime minister spoke to reporters just prior to boarding his flight back home following three days at COP27 in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt – India is aiming for an increase of its renewable energy capacity by over a third within the next five years.
  
  "We are not only acknowledging our responsibility towards tackling climate change but also setting examples to other nations," Prime Minister Modi said during his press conference alongside fellow heads-of-government delegates at COP27, where he highlighted how India had already taken significant steps with its 'Solarize' campaign in states like Gujarat and Rajasthan.
  
  According to the World Bank Climate Change Indicators for South Asia - released annually on January 1st since 2016 but often overlooked amid political debates, India accounts for only around two per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions despite being home to nearly one-fifth of its population.
  
  The country's energy minister Raj Kumar Singh emphasized that "our government is ready and willing to bear the financial cost associated with such a commitment," while acknowledging this would require international cooperation: “We understand India cannot meet these targets alone, but we are hopeful of partnering nations joining hands in achieving our common goal."
  
  This announcement follows recent studies predicting that without immediate measures to curb global warming – including increased investments into clean energy sources and decreased reliance on fossil fuels - several million square kilometers could potentially become uninhabitable by the end of this century. India, as well as countries like Brazil & Indonesia which also depend heavily upon oil production for their economy's growth have been identified in a recent study published last month (October 15th) from leading environmental researcher organizations worldwide that highlighted these stark projections if continued trends persist without intervention.
  
"I can confidently say we are now fully committed to transitioning towards sustainable energy sources as quickly and effectively as possible," said Sunita Narayan, Director-General at Ministry of New & Renewable Energy (MNRE) speaking on the sidelines before addressing Prime Minister Modi's press conference during which she outlined how her department plans to attract both domestic & international private sector investments into solar energy projects through fiscal incentives offered under 'Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana.'
  
While applauded by environmental groups, experts still caution that these numbers remain just a dream without global cooperation. "It's encouraging to see India making strides forward towards becoming an energy superpower; however we need the rest of world leaders taking action alongside us," says Dr Rajesh Kumar - senior economist at CPI-Moscow Center
