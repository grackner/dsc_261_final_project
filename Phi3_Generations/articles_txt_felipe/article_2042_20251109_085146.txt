In a recent turn of events in Hollywood, renowned film director and Oscar nominee Christopher Walton has faced criticism for his portrayal of minority characters on-screen. The uproar began last Thursday when the latest movie directed by him was released to audiences across Los Angeles, with particular focus given to a lead role that cast an African American actor in what many felt were stereotypical circumstances and language reminiscent of old Hollywood tropes.

"The character portrayed is not one I would ever want my own daughter growing up seeing on-screen," said Marla Williams, mother of two young girls who voiced her discomfort to a Los Angeles radio host yesterday afternoon (Friday). "I hope the industry takes notice and starts promoting diversity in authentic roles."

Walton's latest film is set predominantly on New York City streets but was filmed over eight weeks last summer primarily at Warner Brothers Studios outside of Burbank. The movie follows three main characters — two African Americans, played by actors John Davis (42) and Lisa Henderson (35), who find themselves entangled in the criminal underworld while trying to escape poverty; a white woman portrayed as naive and clueless about racial issues at hand.

"We always strive for authenticity, but it seems like my perspective on this particular project was misunderstood," said Walton during an interview with Entertainment Tonight last night (Saturday). "In reality, the roles were complex characters navigating through tough situations; not specifically racially motivated." 

However, critics and audiences alike have pointed out that while it's important to showcase diverse experiences on-screen for educational purposes or pure entertainment value - one must be careful how they are represented. "Hollywood has come a long way in addressing representation issues but still often falls prey to tokenism," said Dr. Alisha Patel, professor of cultural studies at UCLA and expert commentator who frequently writes about race relations on-screen for CNN iReport.

Walton's response came as the backlash continued into last night with several Hollywood insiders speaking out against what they perceived to be Walton’s misguided portrayals in his recent film, including a powerful statement by veteran actor Robert Sinclair (73). "It is disheartening when an artist chooses ignorance of the experiences that real people live through every day. I hope Mr. Walton understands how this resonates with so many viewers."

Walton's studio released a statement late last night saying they were looking into these concerns and would seek professional input before deciding on any future projects involving characters similar to those in the disputed film, but no further action was immediately announced. This incident has highlighted an issue within Hollywood that is not uncommon for many people of color: racial representation matters — particularly when it comes from behind a camera lens - and as audiences become more aware, they are speaking out against portrayals which seem to stereotype or exploit their experiences.

While Walton's studio has not yet provided further comment on the matter aside from promising change will occur in due time; several fans have vowed with social media campaigns #HollywoodCannes2019 and others like it calling for greater diversity behind-the-camera roles instead of simply playing characters that are often exploited or stereotyped.
