In a stunning revelation this weekend, authorities in Santorini, Greece announced that they have discovered an untouched ancient marketplace buried deep beneath their famous cliffs and beaches. The astonishing find has sparked excitement among historians who believe it could date back to the Roman era (circa 205 A.D.).

The underground site was found during a routine excavation on April 3rd, when workers hit an unexpected layer of stones unlike any encountered before in Santorini’s archaeological record. Experts have since been called out to explore the unusual find and are working closely with local authorities at present (May 5th).

Dr. Elena Georgiou-Karatas, a professor of Ancient Greek History at University College London who is not connected with this specific excavation but has studied similar finds in other parts of Greece extensively remarked, "This discovery could offer new insights into trade and commerce during the Roman period on the island."

The underground chamber stretries to be 30 feet wide by 50 deep - large enough for a bustling marketplace with vendors selling goods like wine from across Europe. Intricate pottery, tools used in farming and fishing industries of ancient Greece were found along the site as well indicating that Santorini was an integral part of regional trade during this period (Dr. Georgiou-Karatas).

As per officials' estimates, they anticipate continuing excavations through mid-summer 2023 with hopes to unearth more artifacts and structures in the vicinity that could shed light on Santorini’s past connections throughout antiquity. The site is located about two miles from Oia - one of Greece's most popular tourist destinations known for its postcard-perfect whitewashed buildings with blue domes reflecting against a backdrop of craggy cliffs and turquoise seas (Santorini Tourism Department).

“This is an incredible find,” said Mayor Konstantinos Kotsirounis in the local press. “We are excited about what this discovery could reveal to us as we uncover more of our ancient history.” He added, "The tourists who visit Santorini will now have another reason besides stunning sunsets and blue waters to come back."

For historians across Greece, discovering the marketplace is considered a significant find - one that could reveal valuable insights into not only trade practices but also cultural exchanges during ancient times. Dr. Georgiou-Karatas highlighted this fact while expressing excitement about future investigations at the site: “This kind of discovery gives us an invaluable opportunity to delve deeper and learn more.”

Tourism Minister Evripidis Gavalas announced that appropriate measures are being considered for how best to integrate these discoveries into Santorini’s existing tourist infrastructure without disrupting the natural beauty of Oia. “This is a unique find, something we can potentially showcase as part of our cultural heritage,” he added in an interview with local press outlets (Greek Ministry of Tourism).

The team working on this remarkable archaeological finding has not only uncovered remnants dating back to the Roman era but are now also speculating that it could potentially be as old as 250 B.C., making Santorini’s history even more fascinated and extensive than previously thought
