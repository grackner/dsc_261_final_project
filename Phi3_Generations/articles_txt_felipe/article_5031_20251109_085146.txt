JOHN DOE'S ABUSED STARRY NIGHT IN FRANCE: PHOTOS OF THE MODERN-DAY MUSKRACE ELEPHANT CASTING SHADOW OVER LUXURY BOUTIQUE TOWN OF LA ROCHELLES

By T. Smith 21/09/23, Updated at BBC News on September 22, John Doe's recent visit to the picturesque town of La Rochelle in France has drawn worldwide attention — and not for his anticipated celebrity-study retreat amidst Europe' enduring luxury boutiques. Reports have surfaced about a young woman who appeared frail and malnourished, leading many to worry that she might be suffering from neglect or abuse in the glamorous setting of this French Riviera haven where celebrities often find solace away from prying eyes back home.
 
John Doe was spotted by local residents on a street just off La Rochelle's famous promenade, Les Halles, last Wednesday (20/09). He appeared to be shivering in the mild French fall and had no one nearby helping him as he walked slowly down the cobblestone pathways. Concerned passersby attempted to approach Doe with offers of assistance but were wary about approaching a stranger who seemed so fragile that it almost mirrored scenes from recent films on child abandonment they had watched, or tales relayed through social media's dark underbelly where celebrities often disappear.

"He seemed so fragile; it's a strange thing to see such a young person looking like this. I couldn't help but feel concerned."
 
Marie is not alone, with locals growing increasingly worried about Doe as reports of his condition spread quickly throughout La Rochelle and beyond — the city which boasts one of Europe’s most charming landscapes along a five-mile stretch between its eastern seaside town and medieval core. While initial speculation ranged from celebrities seeking refuge in lesser known towns to those who had simply run out on their fame, concern grew when Doe's condition seemed not be improving since his arrival — or if indeed he was alone at all with no trace of an entourage usually surrounding a celebrity.
 
Early Wednesday morning (21/09), the French authorities were informed by worried citizens and received confirmation that Doe had checked into La Rochelle's exclusive boutique hotel, L’Auberge des Arts de la Cuisine — known for its fine cuisine serving local delicacies. The manager of the five-star establishment revealed to French media outlets that John Doe was indeed a celebrity and he had not disclosed his name upon arrival or when asked multiple times about
