In Nairobi on Tuesday, a local government official announced plans to invest heavily in infrastructure projects across Kenya as part of an ambitious bid to revitalize the economy and create jobs amid rising poverty levels nationwide. The plan, set forth by Mayor Johnson Muthama, would see USD 3 billion allocated towards developing roads, bridges, schools, healthcare facilities, and other public amenities over a five-year period starting from April this year with an annual budget increase of 10%.

"Kenya deserves better living conditions for her citizens," Muthama said during the press conference held at City Hall. "We understand our people's pain as they face increasing poverty, joblessness and social unrest." He also stated that infrastructure development is a proven way to stimulate economic growth by attracting investment opportunities in various sectors such as real estate, tourism and manufacturing industries which would further create employment.

According to the latest government report released yesterday on poverty rates across Kenya'in regions: Northern has 45%, Eastern at 38% with Rural areas experiencing higher levels compared to urban cities due largely in part because of lacking access and investment into infrastructure for decades. "The North-Eastern provinces have been historically neglected, hence their high poverty rates," a professor from the University of Nairobi's School of Economics noted during an interview on national radio earlier today explaining how economic disparities arise between regions within countries and emphasizing that infrastructure development is essential for balanced growth.

Mayor Muthama’s proposal follows similar initiatives by some local governments around the country who have started investing in their communities' wellbeing through revamped public facilities but these efforts had not been sufficient given Kenya's booming population and rapidly urbanizing cities; hence, his plan is seen as bold step towards address longstanding development issues. His administration plans to engage international donors for additional funding while prioritizing securing local funds through taxes and other revenue sources before beginning large-scale projects next year starting with construction of the Mombasa bypass road scheduled commencement in July 2023; expected completion time being five years from project start date.

Experts believe that improving infrastructure is a necessary first step towards reducing poverty levels and creating sustainable economic growth, but it's crucial for officials to maintain transparency throughout the implementation of this plan in order not only gain public trust, but also attract much-needed investment. 

"The biggest challenge lies ahead - proper oversight over these projects once they are underway," an economist from British University London told BBC during a recent interview yesterday highlighting concerns about corruption and mismanagement that could impede progress of such ambitious plans if not properly monitored by civil society organizations, government agencies or independent auditors.

The Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta has recently launched an anti-corruption campaign with the aim to restore public faith in governance while ensuring funds are allocated efficiently towards infrastructure projects like those proposed today; he expressed hope that this initiative will help strengthen social and economic development across all regions of our nation. 

Following several months after last year's devastating locust infestation which resulted to massive crop losses particularly affecting the arid north, many farmers remain impoverished due largely because agriculture contributes
