In an unprecedented development in global politics, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced yesterday a complete disengagement of troops along the Line of Control with Pakistan as part of his commitment to fostering peace and stability in South Asia. The historic agreement was reached after months of intense negotiations facilitated by United States' Special Representative for India-Pakistan Affairs, Zalmay Khalilzad, who arrived on a goodwill visit last month from Islamabad with the intention of deescalating tensions between arch rivals.

The announcement came amidst growing concerns about spiraling hostilities and increasing casualties in disputed regions along Pakistan-India borders over years - most notably Kashmir, which has been a hotbed for conflict since independence from British colonial rule 73 years ago this month on August 15.

"It is time to put an end to the senseless bloodshed and move towards peace," Prime Minister Modi stated while addressing reporters at India's capital New Delhi, breaking with tradition of keeping such statements private until official announcements have been made publicly available on government websites. "Disengagement is not only a necessity but also my promise to every Indian citizen who seeks peace in this land."

In the wake of his statement came an immediate cessation by both armies along LoC-one area that has seen military engagements for more than seven decades since Partitioned British India. The first phase disengagement is expected to begin withdrawal on all sides within three months as per Modi's directive, and the last phase will conclude in one year timeframe or sooner if further progress can be made without compromising national security interests from both countries’ side according to Indian Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale who was present during Prime Minister Modi's press conference yesterday.

"We are cautiously optimistic," said Mr. Gokhale, adding that the initial disengagement will be monitored closely by international peacekeeping agencies including UN High Representative for Disarmament Affairs Izumi Nakamonya while maintaining readiness to intervene if needed during actual withdrawal process which begins tomorrow at midnight local time.

In Pakistan, Foreign Office spokesperson Muhammad Faiq told reporters today that their government has agreed in principle with India's decision and expects reciprocal action soon but still reserves rights over certain areas along LoC till full resolution on Kashmir issue - which includes not only disarmament aspects among other socio-political components as per Islamabad.

"The withdrawal process does come at an unfortunate time of escalating tensions in South Asia, but hopefully marks a new era for fraternity between people across the border," said Pakistan's Permanent Representative Ambassador Rizwan Lodhi who is expected to brief Parliament soon on progress made so far.

Reactions within domestic and international communities have been mixed with some calling it historic moment while others cautioning against complacency amidst remaining unresolved issues between these two nations-which include the most disputed region in world history, Kashmir that lies divided by LoC but remains claimed as Pakistani territory due to lack of resolution over post colonial status.

"A disengagement along Line Of Control does not mean war is over," said retired Lieutenant General Hardeep Singh Puri who heads India's National Security Advisory Council, adding he hopes both
