A gunman allegedly armed with an AR-15 rifle opened fire inside a Los Angeles community center on Friday evening, killing one person and injuring four others before he was taken into custody by law enforcement authorities near the site in Pasadena around midnight local time. Authorities said they were called to 234 El Camino Avenue at approximately six-thirty PM when several people reported hearing gunshots emanating from inside a section of the center used for youth programs, Los Angeles Police Department stated on their official website Friday night as details began emerging into public awareness. The suspect is described as 5'10" with short black hair and dark clothing by eyewitnesses who say he had been wandering aimlessly through the center before taking up position in one of its back areas around seven-thirty PM, according to reports gathered from staff members at a nearby high school where students were present during their lunch hour. In an interview with police officers conducted on Saturday morning prior to arrests being made by specialized tactical response teams dispatched late Friday night after the first shooter was identified near Canyon Lake Drive intersection just east of El Monte Freeway, survivors recount how they were quickly separated into small groups while waiting for a local priest who arrived onsite several hours later to provide spiritual guidance and support. "I can't describe this feeling in words," shared one witness named Johnathan Miller from the nearby school community as he stood next to his close friend Mark Stevens, whose son was also among those present during lunch hour that evening prior until shots rang out near their tables inside a cafeteria adorned with colorful balloons and streamers decorating for graduation season. "Seeing everyone in the center all of a sudden startled by chaos felt surreal," Miller added as he recalled how his own sense of safety quickly dissipated when shouts broke out between those huddled together, fear permeating their once jovial atmosphere while they awaited what seemed like an eternity for the shooting to stop. Later that evening after initial shock subsided and authorities had arrived at 9PM local time by Canyon Lake Drive intersection just east of El Monte Freeway where several eyewitnesses identified a lone individual matching descriptions provided earlier this day, LA County Sheriff's deputies arrested the suspect on various charges related to weapons possession after locating him hiding behind some bushes near an exit ramp from Canyon Lake Drive. A subsequent search of his vehicle led authorities to find several unregistered firearms including one that had been modified into what appeared as a makeshift AR-15 rifle capable of firing semi-automatic and fully automatic bursts, sparking immediate concern among officials who stressed this discovery highlights an urgent need for better gun control measures within the city. "We must prioritize public safety while respecting individuals' rights," said Sheriff Ramirez in a press conference on Saturday morning following his team's successful operation to capture suspect Richard Thompson at about 1AM local time, who remains in custody pending trial where he faces multiple counts of attempted murder with intent under California state laws. "We understand the sensitivities surrounding this tragedy," Sheriff Ramirez continued as he emphasized that his primary focus lies within enforcing stricter regulations for carrying firearms and enhancing background checks when purchasing from licensed sellers, aiming to prevent future occurrences similar to what
