Congress Considers Major Overhaul of Retirement System After Decades in Crisis  
In a sweeping move aimed at rejuvenating America's failing retirement system and ensdealing millions of Americans who depend on it, Congress is set to vote next week on an ambitious plan that would expand eligibility for Social Security benefits. The proposal comes as the latest attempt by policymakers to combat widespread financial instability among older adults across various demographics in major cities nationwide and rural areas alike since reports last year have indicated a significant number of retirees are barely making ends meet without supplemental income sources.  

The measure, known as the Retirement Security Act (RSA), would increase minimum age for eligibility from 65 to 70 years old while simultaneously boosting annual benefit amounts by up to $2,000 a year based on an individual's lifetime earnings and family size. "This plan will provide much-needed relief to countless Americans who rely solely on Social Security benefits for their livelihood," said Senator Maria Hernandez during the Senate floor debate today where she is one of several leading lawmakers pushing forward with RSA before a final vote next Thursday (March 14).  

The idea gained traction after years in limbo following failed attempts to modernize and reform Social Security that have been met repeatedly by fierce resistance from some political factions, including conservatives who argue the program is unsustainable for future generations. However, supporters contend millions of Americans are at risk without further support given current economic conditions marked by increasing costs related to healthcare expenses and dwindling savings rates among middle-aged workers approaching retirement age with significant debt burdens that have only worsened during the last five years following recession.  

According to data from federal agencies, more than 40% of Americans over the age of 65 are living on less than $20,000 per year while nearly one-third struggle with debt that exceeds their annual income levels in many cases due largely because retirees have not saved enough for a comfortable lifestyle. "This plan will help those who depend solely or primarily on Social Security benefits to keep up with rising costs of living without burdening future generations," added Hernandez, whose district includes affluent communities as well as low-income neighborhoods heavily reliant on social services in the Northeast region.  

Critics remain unconvinced about how RSA will be paid for or whether it can adequately address concerns that Social Security faces solvency issues beyond those affecting retirees and other beneficiaries, especially considering mounting pressure from younger generations to secure financial stability in old age. One recent study by the nonprofit National Institute on Retirement Security found only 42% of American workers have access to a workplace-sponsored pension plan through their employer which supplements Social Security benefits, highlighting that more support is needed for retirees across income levels and socioeconomic backgrounds alike.  

"The government must do much more than simply raising the age limit or increasing benefit amounts under RSA," argued Representative John Kim during a House Financial Services Committee hearing today where he urged lawm0vers to explore alternative solutions such as introducing private investment options and expanding retirement education programs aimed at
