Athletes from various countries gathered at Tokyo's Olympic Village to compete in disciplines ranging from gymnastthy and swimming to archery and taekwondo on Tuesday (July 28). The latest round of events saw numerous athletes aiming for their chance at gold, with some hoping to repeat the success they had achieved during preliminary rounds.

Among them was American gymnast Simone Biles who captured a bronze in beam finals after missing out on her initial qualification performance by just five points due to an unfortunate slip of hers that ended up costing her teammate the lead spot, according to USA Gymnastics representatives.

"I was shocked when I saw my score drop from 9.520 (highest possible) on Day One because a technical fall meant losing valuable points," Biles said in an exclusive interview with reporters after her disappointing performance led the team to settle for silver overall, marking their fourth consecutive Olympic podium finish despite never winning gold individually throughout career thus far.

Her coach, Valorie Kondos-Apetolo told CBS Sports News that while Biles is understandably frustrated with not securing another individual title after six World Championship wins and four Olympics medals including two silvers since 2013 when she first joined the US national team at just thirteen years old, but this Olympic experience will still be one thing they can share together for a long time - even if it might not go exactly as planned sometimes.

"I guess life is never perfect or predictable," Kondos-Apetolo said when asked about Biles' emotions following today’s event which ended around 6:30 PM (Japan Standard Time). "But I believe my girls will come back stronger because they know that adversity won't break them, it makes us. And Simone has shown time and again how resilient she is."

Biles was joined by fellow teammates whose fortunes mirrored hers - some succeeded while others floundered under pressure at these world-class events where tough competition can be unforgiving even if the sportsmanship remains respectful. British gymnast Amy Hunt, who took bronze in beam finals just 15 months ago ahead of Simone's own first career medal and later secured gold with her teammates back home at UK National Championships as well recently during Diamond League meets overseas this year (2024), had a different outlook on the day.

"I feel really proud to represent my country here in Tokyo," Hunt told an interviewer from Channel 4 News Network shortly after her performance ended around noon local time yesterday while wearing Team GB colors alongside Biles during medal ceremony hours later that evening which would see five medals overall claimed by British women including three golds for Katherine Nind and teammates Jessica Gomersall, Catie Cambourne as well as Amy Hunt's own individual gold after winning out in final series yesterday afternoon.

"It might not have been the result I wanted to achieve today but nothing worthwhile comes easily," added a visibly humbled yet proud athlete when asked by BBC Sport correspondents about how she felt at this point onwards throughout her journey thus far since qualifying for Tokyo Games back in 2019 alongside Simone and Megan Alexander (now married) along with Ellie Gibson, Beth Potter who
