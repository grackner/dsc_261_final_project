In Beijing yesterday, tensions escalated as military exerносиes from Taiwan conducted a large-scale live-fire drill in waters close to mainland China's coastline for the first time since December of last year, according to CNN reporting and eyewitness accounts. The exercise started around 9am local time (17:00 GMT) near Fujian province and concluded after several hours as both sides reiterated their commitments to peaceful resolution despite heightened anxieties among the population on both sides of the strait, which has been a flashpoint in Sino-Taiwanese relations.


"This drill is just one part of our regular routine and we have always operated with caution," stated Taiwan's Minister of National Defense Yen Ching said during yesterday’s press conference as per DailyMail reports, while adding that "all exercises are designed to maintain peace in the region."


Experts warned against reading too much into these drills, emphasizing instead on their purpose for readiness and not aggression. The commander of Taiwan's Southern Commander Guo Huiwei was also interviewed by Reuters which indicated that "the main goal is to enhance our defensive capabilities while maintaining transparency with neighbors."


As the exercise concluded, both Beijing and Taipei have expressed their desire for regional stability. In a statement from China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday afternoon: “We urge relevant parties not to use military activities as means of disturbance or provocation.” 


In response, Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen reiterated in an address at the National Palace Museum that "Taiwan is committed to maintaining a robust defense and our resolve for peace." This week's exercises come amid ongoing talks between Beijing and Taipei regarding cross-strait relations, with both sides signaling their intentions are aimed towards stability.


Reactions among citizens have been mixed — some express unease over the military display while others view it as a necessary measure for national security given recent tensions in the region; international observers continue to closely watch developments on either side of the strait, hoping that diplomatic efforts will prevail over militaristic displays.


The next round of talks between Taiwanese and Chinese officials are scheduled for early next week with hopes high among peace advocates worldwide for a positive outcome in negotiations promoting stability across Asia-Pacific waters as they believe the region is at risk if territorial disputes continue to escalate.
