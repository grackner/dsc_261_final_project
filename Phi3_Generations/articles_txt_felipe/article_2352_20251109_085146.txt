Amidst growing tensions in European waters, a cargo ship registered under Panamanian flag collided with an unmarked submarine off the coast of Norway on Saturday morning. The accident occurred near Bodø and authorities have launched an immediate investigation into what is believed to be military equipment lost at sea. Norwegian Coast Guard officials confirmed that while there were no casualties, several crew members abode ship sustained minor injuries from which they are currently being treated in local hospitals.

The submarine involved has been reportedly sighted by multiple eyewits within the past 24 hours after it surfaced unexpectedly near Bodø; however, identifying details remain elusive due to its undisclosed status and unmarked appearance. Norwegian officials are said to be working closely with their counterparts in other countries as part of a broader effort to locate the submarine swiftly since experts speculate that international laws might have been breached if it's indeed military-grade equipment without proper registration or notification, reports Yahoo News Europe.

"We must ensure every piece is recovered safely and respect our commitment towards maritime security," Norwegian Defense Minister Bente Norheim stated to CNN while on an official visit in Oslo last night regarding the incident which has unnerved both Norway's seafaring citizens as well NATO allies. She added, "We are fully committed to transparency and cooperation with our international partners."

According to witnesses who live near Bodø harbor where most of the debris from this accident was collected by Norwegian Coast Guard boats last night around 20:30 local time (17:30 UTC), a large black object emerged on their radar just before midnight. "We've never seen anything like that, it resembled something out of science fiction," said fisherman Lars Olsen to CNN as he recounted seeing the mysterious craft while docking his boat for repairs near Bodø yesterday afternoon; adding with a laugh and shrugged shoulders - 'It was just really odd'.

A NATO spokesperson told Al Jazeera, "We are aware of an incident involving unidentified submarine detected by allied forces in European waters. We have been informed that Norway's Coast Guard reported the sighting and immediately launched a rescue operation." The anonymous quote came after it was confirmed to CNN through multiple sources within NATO communication channels; however no statement has yet officially come from any party involved concerning ownership or nationality of this vessel aside Norwegian officials maintain there is "no evidence" that supports ties with an adversarial nation.

Experts in maritime affairs and naval engineering have weighed-in on the unfortunate collision noting unusual behavior as well as technical malfunctions possibly related to a power surge during turbulent weather conditions along Norway's northern coastline where strong currents frequently disrupt navigation systems aboard even standard ships. 

Professor Henrik Svensson, director of marine studies at Oslo Maritime University shared his thoughts on the matter saying "This could point towards possible negligence or a failure in maintaining adequate security measures - something we can investigate further as more information becomes available." He added that such incidents have become increasingly common over past few years due to rising piracy threats and escalating territorial disputes across Europe's waters.

Norwegian authorities plan on deploying additional resources in the coming days with hopes of locating any surviv
