Scientists in New York City have developed a potential new treatment for Alzheimer'sude that shows promise in early clinical trials conducted over the past year at Magee-Wexham Hospital on Roosevelt Island, reports Dr. Lisa Sanders, an associate professor of neurology and geriatric medicine with Johns Hopkins Medicine Center.

"This treatment could mark a turning point in Alzheimer's care," said lead researcher Dr. Emily Carter during the recent American Academy for Neurological Care conference on April 15, where preliminary findings were shared among experts attending from across the nation and around three continents.

The treatment focuses primarily on reducing amyloid plaques in patients' brains by using a modified version of insulin administered through nasal sprays twice daily for six months as part of an experimental therapy dubbed 'Neuro-InsuLinx.' These individuals were selected due to genetic markers that suggest they could be more susceptible and respond favorably. Accordingly, 12 patients with early signs have been enrolled in the trial so far, which is still ongoing but has already shown some positive results regarding cognitive functions when compared against standard care practices for Alzheimer's disease treatments available up to now such as donepezil and memantine drugs.

"I am cautiously optimistic about these early findings," stated Dr. Michael Kovacevic, Director of the Memory Disorders Clinic at Magee-Wexham Hospital while emphasizing that it is too soon for conclusive statements regarding efficacy or safety issues related to Neuro-InsuLinx therapy based on limited patient data so far available but he added: "It's encouraging nonetheless, and we are hopeful about what further results might show."

However experts emphasized that additional larger scale studies will be needed before drawing final conclusions. One such study is set to start soon where 120 patients with early signs of Alzheimer’s disease whose genetic markers fit the profile for potential positive responses in Neuro-InsuLinx treatment are scheduled to begin enrollment next month at various sites across New York City and Philadelphia under federal grant support from National Institute on Aging. The two year trial period will be conducted with close monitoring of safety, cognition impacts through MRI imaging along side amyloid plaque counts in brain tissue samples obtained during biopsies to verify results directly related thereto or potentially discrediting findings against standardized care practices and other alternative treatments.

Dr. Susan Thompson head researcher at the New York University Langone Medical Center commented on recent news, "As we continue our rigorous scientific inquiry into this treatment approach for Alzheimer's disease while also remaining aware of any possible risks involved in further studies or even eventual mass implementation." The worldwide search continues to discover ways by which age-related dementia like Alzheimer’s could be effectively treated, delayed or perhaps prevented altogether.

Next Steps: Patient safety will always remain our top priority as this exciting new development unfolds within the realm of science and medicine for those affected worldwide while also acknowledging that even with positive preliminary results from initial trials ongoing today here in NYC, it's crucial to maintain a balanced perspective towards these findings without rushing conclusions. Further studies are still needed before any
