A powerful winter storm is sweeping across parts of Texas today, with temperatures plummeting and significant snowfall expected in many areas overnight into Friday morning. The National Weather Service has issued a Winter Storm Warning for the northern regions as it monitors potential hazardous conditions that could impact travel, infrastructure, and power supply.

Temperatures are forecast to drop well below freezing by late tonight with snow accumulations expected upwards of 12 inches in areas northwest of Dallas, reports WFAA TV from the local weather station there. The cold front is part of a larger system moving eastward into New England, likely bringing severe wintry mix conditions for parts of Maine and New Hampshire by early this weekend according to NBC Boston’s meteorologist Mike Dempsey.

In Texas, temperatures as low as 20 degrees Fahrenheit are forecast overnight before rising back above freezing in the Dallas-Fort Worth area tomorrow morning with wind chill values reaching -10 or colder throughout most of that same region during peak cold hours late tonight. This sudden drop from highs recently approaching 70 to potential lows below zero has prompted concerns among officials regarding power outages and limited heating capacity, especially in rural areas where homes may rely on propane for warmth when temperatures dip this low or colder.

“We are monitoring the situation very closely,” said Texas Governor Greg Abbott during a briefing at the Capitol today afternoon, adding that “all hands are on deck” to address any issues arising from frigid conditions ahead of winter storm warnings expected overnight into Friday morning across much of East and South Central parts of state.

“The National Weather Service has issued a Winter Storm Warning for many counties in North Texas,” Abbott added, urging Texans not travel unless absolutely necessary as the possibility exists that they may face dangerous driving conditions on slick roads due to both rain and snow-mix precipitation tonight into Friday morning.

The Dallas Fort Worth area metropolitan is also bracing for potentially heavy rainfall associated with this winter storm system, particularly along I-35E east of downtin Townsquare Media Group has reported from multiple local forecasters’ estimates over the next several hours who are expecting 2 to 4 inches in some areas as precipitation changes on its way into north Texas before moving further south through Southeast and East Central parts.

“It could get worse tomorrow morning if another cold front moves across our area,” said Meteorologist with Weather Underground, Paul Kachlan based out of his office at the University Townsquare Media Group’s Dallas branch near SMU yesterday afternoon to reporters attending a press conference about preparations and weather conditions ahead this weekend.

“I wouldn't be surprised if we see wind chill values down in single digits tonight with temperatures falling below freezing here early tomorrow morning,” Kachlan cautioned, noting that the Texas Panhandle area was under a Winter Storm Warning as well and could experience gusty 25-40 mph sustained winds overnight along with blinding snowfall in some places by mid-morning.

Experts from various sources including NOAA have issued multiple warnings today to residents across parts of Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas about potential for power outages due to high demand as heating is needed amid extreme cold temperatures expected tonight through Friday morning here at home along with rain associated
