In a surprising turn of events this weekend in Los Angeles, legendary TV host Ryan Reynolds announced his return to television with an all-new sketch comedy show titled 'The New Dodge'. Coinciding releases and previews began last Thursday evening at the historic Paramount Theater. The star's comeback was met with roaring applause from a sold-out crowd of celebrities, TV personalities, writers, and fans alike who were eager to see if Reynolds could keep up his frenetic energy on stage while delivering quick jokes between rapid exchanges.

"I am thrilled about the positive response we received," said Ryan after taking a bow during Saturday's performance at The Roxy Theatre in Beverly Hills, which sold out within hours of ticket sales opening last month by Paramount Pictures and Universal Studios. "There is something special about bringing my comedy to life on stage again."

The 41-year-decade old actor first began his career as a standup comic at the age of fifteen before transitioning into film, winning over audiences with witty one-liners and slapstick humor. He's best known for portraying nearsighted bounty hunters in films like "The Long Hike Back" (2015), which grossed $76 million worldwide during its year of release, but also brought his comedic prowess to the small screen as host on sketch shows such as 'Snatch Game' and guest-starred frequently.

In announcing this return, Reynolds told reporters that he wanted to create something "fresh" for both himself and comedy lovers nationwide: 

"I believe laughter is a universal language," the Hollywood heavyweight asserted before taking his first bow onstage last Saturday night in front of an adoring audience. "It's time I bring back my signature style while also creating something new." After months of working with writers and directors, Reynolds revealed that 'The New Dodge' would be a sketch comedy show featuring celebrity impressions from various decades - ranging from Fred Flintstone to Tom Hanks.

Critics have praised the concept saying it brings together "Reynold's signature humor with his passion for entertainment history". Actors who starred in 'The Long Hike Back', such as Emma Thompson, and others including Tina Fey voiced their excitement about seeing Reynolds back onstage:

"Ryan has been a part of the comedy world long before I was. It's fantastic to see him doing what he loves most," said Meryl Streep after meeting with her 'Friends'-era co-star at Los Angeles Comedy Store in February 2018 when they were both on tour together for different projects, but sharing the same agent and industry friend. "His timing is impeccable - he makes you laugh out loud."

Since Reynolds announced his return earlier this year to create a new sketch comedy show based around celebrity impressions from past Hollywood hits through nostalgia-driven humor on stage, fans have been eagerly awaiting each episode's release. The first season of 'The New Dodge', which premiered last Sunday night at the historic Pantages Theatre in Los Angeles and will wrap up its initial run with a finale set for next month - has received consistently high ratings among comedy enthusiasts across all age groups nationwide who were thrilled to
