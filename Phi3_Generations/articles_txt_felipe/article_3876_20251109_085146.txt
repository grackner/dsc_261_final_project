Jeremy Strong Takes on Complex Role as Season Three Travels Around the World in Search of True Love | CNN News Articles - Entertainment DailyMind

CNN — Jeremy Strong returns to television audiences this fall with a complex new role that promises both laughter and heartache. In his latest series, "Love Unbound," he takes on an ambitious mission straight from the pages of romance novels: To find true love across four continents within one year while simultaneously building a sustainable global community centered around shared values and dreams.

Streaming service AcmeTV announced yesterday that it had renewed Strong's show for another three seasons, citing its critical acclaim among both audiences and critics alike as the main reason behind this decision. The series takes a unique approach to tackling issues of globalization by bringing together individuals from diverse cultures who share common aspirations such as environmental conservation, equality, and education reform - all while Strong embarks on his personal love journey in search of someone special that matches not just intellectually but spiritually with him.

"I wanted to create a character whose life experiences transcended the conventional television narrative," said Jeremy about playing Samir Patel's alter ego, Balraj Khanna - an international businessman who now seeks purpose in his heart over prosperity in his wallet as he begins this ambitious year-long journey.

The series premiered last month with its first season set primarily around South Asia and Europe; however due to immense demand for more content, AcmeTV announced that they will film the next two seasons across different continents – starting in Africa (January 2024), followed by Latin America then finally back home in North America.

Strong has already captured many hearts with his warmth and charisma as Samir's sidekick while navigating through cultural challenges to create connections beyond words on the show - leading some fans hoping he may one day find a life partner of their own off-screen that matches not only mind but soul.

"I believe I am searching for something much more profound than just love," said Balraj, who has spent decades in his career as an entrepreneur making waves across continents before returning home with newfound purpose to explore deeper aspects of human connection and understanding through this journey he hopes will change the world.

"Love Unbounded is a remarkable blend that weaves together powerful storytelling, thought-provoking social commentary, heartwarming moments between friends from various backgrounds who become like family as they embark on adventures in search of true love," said AcmeTV Executive Producer Marcia Clarkson. "We couldn't be more excited to continue watching Jeremy Strong bring Balraj Khanna back with us into Season Three."

As the world awaits what will surely become another gripping season, Samir has already begun making plans for his extended journey while reflecting on how this year-long mission could change not only himself but everyone he comes in contact. "We live in such divisive times that I feel it is our responsibility to build bridges rather than walls - both physically and emotionally," said Balraj, surrounded by a diverse group of fans from his various travels on the set yesterday during filming wrapped for Season Two.
