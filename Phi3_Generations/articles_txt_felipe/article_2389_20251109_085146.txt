Topic: Business - After-Hours

As night fell over downtown Manhattan on Thursday, Wall Street businesses and workers found themselves dealing with an unexpected blackout that lasted for nearly two hours starting at around 8pm local time. Around 9:45pm the lights flickered back to life just as employees were preparing to leave their workstations after a long day's grind, leaving them in disbelief about what had transpired between working hours that ended for most of Wall Street at around five PM.

"This was not something we have experienced on the streets before," said Michael Rossi, an electrician who works maintenance back-up services to some major financial institutions located along Broad Street and Avenue C near Wall Street's center. "We were just wrapping up our regular inspection when suddenly everything went dark." 

As many as thirty banks in Manhattan are now being investigated by the New York City Department of Buildings for potential code violations that could have caused or contributed to this unprecedented blackout, while power companies work around-the-clock attempting to find its root cause. The sudden loss of electricity began after a routine inspection had been completed at 8:15pm near the Chinatown neighborhood when two separate workers noticed that their electrical equipment was shutting down and they could no longer communicate with other employees or dispatchers via walkie-talkies, which are standard in this trade.

As a result of these developments, New York Governor Kathy Hochul issued an urgent statement yesterday afternoon instructing all city agencies to prepare for the possibility that another similar blackout could occur at any moment during after-hours operations across NYC and offering her guidance should one arise in future events. "While we continue investigations with confidence, it is our top priority as New Yorkers to ensure public safety," Hochul declared firmly through a city press release yesterday afternoon that has already been picked up by several outlets nationwide including CNN Business News Network for immediate distribution among their global audience of subscribers who may be affected in the event.

Witnesses recall feeling disoriented and confused during this brief period when darkness descended upon Manhattan's financial district like a shroud after sunset on Thursday evening until just before 10pm local time — although most employees had left their workstations by then, they were greeted with bright streetlights once power returned almost two hours later around this same hour.

"It was surreal watching everyone else rush out as if some sort of disaster struck," recalled former stock trader John Anderson who spent his last day working on Wall Street's Buttonwood Row before taking early retirement back in 2017 after nearly a decade serving at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).
"We all just stood there like zombies staring up into space." he chuckled remembering that moment, trying hard not to laugh as his voice cracked. "But we were also relieved when lights came back on again and things started going back normal by then - I felt guilty leaving work early because it seemed so unnecessary but everyone else was doing the same thing around me too!"

As city officials ponder over this unfortunate incident, speculation has been running rampant across various social media platforms including Twitter where some users claim that "this wasn't an isolated event," and others are calling for immediate action to prevent future occurrences like these from happening again.
