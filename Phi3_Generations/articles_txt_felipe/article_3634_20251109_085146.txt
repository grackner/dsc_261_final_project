"Researchers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena have discovered a new asteroid that could potentially come within just six lunar distances of Earth next month according to calculations published on January 15, 2023. The celestial body has been named 'Mavenge,' after the famed ship explorers from Jules Verne's classic novels."

"NASA scientists have identified a newly discovered asteroid that will make its closest approach to Earth on March 1, when it is projected to be only six lunar distances away - less than three times as far away the moon orbits our planet. The JPL-led team made their finding using advanced telescopes and space technology."

"In an unexpected turn of events that could catch astronomers by surprise, Dr. Maria Rodriguez, lead scientist on Mavenge study says this near-Earth asteroid's trajectory is currently considered unpredictable due to the gravitational pull from nearby planets like Jupiter and Mars." 

"Dr. James Thompson, an astrophysicist at MIT shares his views: 'The uncertainty in predicting Mavenge’s path underscores a need for continuous monitoring of space bodies near Earth's orbit.' He explains how the team is constantly tracking its movements to understand more about it and refine their projections."

"Despite the uncertain forecast, NASA officials reassure that there remains no immediate threat from Mavenge. 'At six lunar distances away, even a body like this wouldn't cause significant harm,' says Dr. Elizabeth Smith at NASA headquarters in Washington D.C.. She clarifies how such calculations are done and explains why people living on Earth need not worry about an imminent asteroid strike."

"Mavenge’s discovery has sparked enthusiasm within the scientific community, who eagerly await more data to be gathered from various telescopes in orbit. 'We're all excited by this opportunity,' says Dr. Rodriguez on further studies Mavenge might offer us about our solar system."

"Researchers hope that studying objects like Apachee will provide key insights into the origins of Earth and other planets, as well as understanding more details about how asteroids form and evolve over time," concludes Dr. Rodriguez on possible future benefits Mavenge could bring to science and our knowledge of space exploration."
