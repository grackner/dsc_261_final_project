A luxurious new hotel opening in Monaco promises to redefine high-end hospitality with its breathtaking views and unparalleled services expected to begin welcoming guests next month. Touted as a five-star experience, the Grand Opulence Resort is set just off Monte Carlo's main boulevard La Condamine, at 123 Prestige Avenue, Monaco (MC), scheduled for its grand opening on June 5th.

The hotel features an opulent design inspired by classic European style combined with modern convenience and sustainability practices that aim to minimize environmental impact without sacrificing luxury or service quality. Designed exclusively as a retreat for the world's elite, it will provide personalized experiences in dining, spa services, yacht charters on nearby Monte Carlo Bay, and gourmet private butlers catering around guests' preferences at all times of day.

According to the hotel’thandler, Mr. Laurent Duvalier, "We believe that elegance should coexist with eco-conscious decisions; thus every aspect from organic linens in guest rooms and solar panels on our roofs are carefully considered." The 120 suite accommodations come complete with floor-to-ceiling windows providing sweeping ocean views, marble bathrooms, designer furniture by noted artisans, and each room boasts a personal butler who anticipates guests' needs before they ask.

Guests at the Grand Opulence Resort will have access to an award-winning Michelin restaurant overlooking Monte Carlo Bay with signature dishes created from locally sourced organic produce delivered daily by the resort’s own fleet of electric vehicles, which also provides transportation for guests between their hotel rooms and selected restaurants within Monaco.

"We've worked closely with renowned chefs to craft a menu that balances traditional gastronomical delights with innovative dishes," stated Chef Isabelle Roux during the press conference last week, adding "Our aim is not only providing top-notch food but also contributing positively towards our environment."

In addition to luxurious accommodations and services onsite, guests can indulge in unforgettable experiences. They will have access a private helicopter for aerial tours of Monaco’s picturesque harbor or the French Riviera coastline within an hour's range from their rooms at Grand Opulence Resort which is just 10 minutes away by electric vehicle ride-on service provided exclusively to guests.

In terms of pricing, rates for suites start in the $25,000 per night bracket and will depend on demand during peak seasonal times like summer holidays or New Year's Eve when Monaco attracts a worldly crowd seeking luxury escapes with unparalleled service.

The Grand Opulence Resort represents the epitome of style, sophistication, and sustainable living all rolled into one extravagant package that promises to redefine high-end hospitality for years to come in Monaco's glittering gambling town on water.
