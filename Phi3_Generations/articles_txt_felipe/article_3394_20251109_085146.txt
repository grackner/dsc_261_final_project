In a historic event that has taken place in Cairo, Egypt, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators have met for direct talks to discuss issues of mutual concern with the goal of reaching an agreement on peace by November 2014 (source: Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs; source: PLO statement).

The meeting comes amid a flurry of diplomatic activity in recent months, as both nations seek to build upon previous rounds of talks held since October 9. Despite lingering tensions over security concerns and settlement building on the Israeli side, representatives from Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs led by Minister Avigdor Lieberman, alongside Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat have gathered at a neutral location in Cairo for what has been hailed as an opportunity to bridge differences.

"This is not just about politics but people," said Mr. Lieberman ahead of the meeting last weekend. "We must find common ground and discuss how we can make peaceful coexistence possible." 

In response, Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat added that talks were essential to addressing pressing issues facing both peoples: from access to resources like water for agriculture or electricity generation in Gaza Strip; resolution of territorial disputes regarding Jerusalem's status and borders between the West Bank/East Jerusalem as well. 

As tensions over these matters continue, observers have expressed cautious optimism about this latest attempt at dialogue - despite previous failed peace initiatives like Camp David Accords or Oslo Agreements that collapsed after initial progress due to lack of sustained commitment from either side and insufficient trust between negotiators.

The negotiation team consists of 14 members – four each representing Israel, the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah-controlled West Bank/Gaza Strip (PA) along with three independent observers: one American diplomat who has experience working on peace issues globally; another European representative knowledgeable about Middle East affairs and a respected Arab scholar fluent in both English and Arabic. 

Their discussions cover various topics, including economic cooperation to enhance livelihoods for ordinary citizens living under occupation - particularly Palestinians caught up between Israeli security barriers or settler confrontations; improving access of Gaza residents seeking employment opportunities in Israel's dynamic economy without endangering border stability. 

"Economic prosperity is critical to achieving a peaceful resolution," said John Kerry, U.S Secretary of State who met separately with Palestinian and Israeli negotiators last month at the same venue as this weekend’s talks were held in Cairo's conference room 427 (as per security officials). "We must address economic disparities if we are to move forward."

Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas stressed that, for any agreement on the political and territorial status of Jerusalem or borders between Israelis settlers vs Palestinians refugees in Gaza Strip; there would be no peace without addressing fundamental socio-economic disparities existing today: "Education is also a key issue to work upon. We need joint projects that will promote understanding among our people."

Abbas’ appeal resonated with many Palestinians who feel marginalized by years of occupation and settlement expansion, but Israeli officials argue there's little room for territorial compromise on the West Bank while
