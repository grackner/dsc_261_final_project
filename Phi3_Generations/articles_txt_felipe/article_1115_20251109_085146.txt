It's been nearly two decthy years since hot springs tourism hit its peak in Japan; however, a recent survey reveals that this trend is now on an unstoppable decline due to concerns over environmental impact and natural resources depletion. Researchers found significant decreases at popular destinations such as Onsen-City (fictional name), nestled near the hot springs fields in Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost island known for its breathtaking landscapes and historic geothermal sites attracting millions of visitors each year.

In a report released on Tuesday, conservationists warned that continuous excessive use could lead to irreversible damage within the next decade if unchecked sustainability measures are not put into place immediately; this comes as environmental regulations have recently tightened due in part from government-initiated plans announced last year.

Dr. Haruto Yamamoto, a senior researcher at The Environmental Impact Survey Group and lead author of the study stated: "The situation is dire if we continue to ignore our impact on these natural treasures." He further added that while visitor numbers have remained relatively stable over recent years, their cumulative environmental footprint has had detrimental effects resulting in water temperature reduction by 3.2 degrees Fahrenheit since the year prior to last when Japan's tourism peaked.

The survey which incorporated feedback from local businesses and community members alike also found that many smaller guesthouses have begun offering discounted eco-friendly packages in an attempt to preserve their customer base, while some resort owners remain skeptical of these practices stating: "It's hard for us as operators; we need the cashflow."

In response to this concerning issue, Hokkaido’s local government has begun implementing new regulations that require all hotels and guesthouses within designated areas near geothermal sites or onsen fields - popular places where locals congregate for relaxation by bathing in natural water sources known as "onsen" — to submit quarterly environmental impact assessments. This follows a recommendation from the Ministry of Tourism released last fall which highlighted these concerns and urged better stewardship among resort owners, tour operators, and visitors alike; however, experts believe that stricter enforcement is needed for this plan to be effective going forward: "Enforcing policies alone isn't enough. We must educate guests about their individual impacts as well."

While the decline of hot springs tourism in Japan has become an undeniable reality, efforts are being made by concerned organizations and locals who wish to preserve these natural wonders for future generations; this includes a growing number of conservation-minded travelers taking more sustainable paths towards experiencing Japanese onsen culture.

As the country continues its push toward eco-friendliness, with plans already underway that aim at protecting not only hot springs areas but also broader regions known for ecotourism within Japan's environmentally rich and diverse landscapes — from rainforests in Kyushu to beaches along Okinawa Island— experts remain hopeful about finding the balance between preservation efforts, economic stability of local communities reliant on tourism industry revenues as well sustainability: "This issue isn't just environmental; it’s also social and political. We need everyone working together towards a solution."
