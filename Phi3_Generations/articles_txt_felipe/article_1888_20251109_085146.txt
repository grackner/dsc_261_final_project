Prime Minister Kishida stressed that the focus is on empowering local businesses to drive growth in their respective regions while also creating employment opportunities for many Japanese people still struggling under pandemic-era job scarcity and inflationary pressures;

Tokyo's Mayor Yuriko Koike, who expressed support towards this initiative during yesterday’s Tokyo Metropolitan Government meeting praised the effort saying "By fostering our local businesses to become engines of growth not only for themselves but also contribute significantly toward reviving Japan economy. It has been a long time coming."

Business experts and economists have hailed Kishida's initiative as 'bold'. Professor Hiroshi Yamauchi, an esteemed professor at the University of Tokyo’s Graduate School of Economics stated that "These are very positive signs indeed. Investing in local businesses is essential to stimulate economic growth and this injection will surely spark a ripple effect through various sectors."
