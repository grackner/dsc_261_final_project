A small town in New Mexico experienced an unexpected sighting of a UFO last night that has piqued public and scientific interest across America. In Ruidoso, locals reported seeing three silver objects flying over the nearby Pecos National Historic Landmark at approximately 11 p.m., as seen from their backyards by several witnesses including longtime resident Tom Harris.

"I've been living here all my life and I never expected to see something like this," said Harris, who noted that he initially mistook the lights for commercial aircraft before they quickly changed direction at odd angles unexplainable through normal aviation physics. "It was just too bizarre not to be one of those stories we hear about every other month."

According to Ruidoso Police Chief David Martinez, his department received calls from three separate parties reporting the sighting: Harris in Ruidoso itself; a group comprising four amateur astronomers residing within an hour'thoroughly equipped observatory at Carlsbad Caverns National Park also spotted them simultaneously with naked eyes and through their telescopes, as did another witness via drone footage.

"These people tell us that they felt like time stopped during those few minutes when the UFOs were present," Martinez told CNN in an interview today while still investigating how best to handle this case without causing widespread panic or giving rise to speculation and misinformation, he said. "We are trying not to jump ahead of ourselves but at least we need more information on the matter."

The sudden appearance coincided with a powerful aurora borealis display witnessed by residents in Ruidoso who have reported an increase in such events over recent years due to solar activity that NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory continues monitoring closely for potential impact. Given this possible link, Martinez said experts were invited yesterday afternoon for consultation about the sighting but no one arrived until early today morning when Dr. Helen Reynolds from SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) Institute expressed interest in participating and analyzed available data alongside University of New Mexico astrophysicists, who agreed to assist with remote research through a shared video conference link they established this afternoon.

Dr. Reynolds told CNN that her team was examining the witnesses' accounts while taking into consideration known atmospheric phenomena such as noctilucent clouds and ball lightning occurrences for explanations on unidentified flying objects (UFOs) but added, "This sighting is unlike anything we have ever seen before; it has not been catalogued in our databases."

"While unusual UFO incidents do happen quite often around the world," Dr. Reynolds continued explaining further background context about previous encounters and scientific research on possible extraterrestrial visitors, "they usually come down to misidentifications or local natural phenomena like aurorae events that create visual anomalies which lead observers astray."

Ruidoso Mayor Jane Martinez said her administration had already contacted the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Air Force pilots nearby, but they found no aircraft in their airspace at any given time. She also reassured Ruidoso's residents that she was confident this instance would soon be resolved without causing unnecessary alarm or fear while urging everyone to remember "that science requires open-mindedness and rigorous investigation."

As for the witnesses, they remain fascinated but unsur
