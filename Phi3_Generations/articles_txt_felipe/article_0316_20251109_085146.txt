In an unprecedented climatic event that shocked residents across Miami-Dade County last Saturday afternoon, a massive sinkhole swallowed parts of three homes without warning, CNN reports based on local authorities' statements and resident testimonies. The incident occurred in the quiet neighborhood surrounding Oak Avenue when one home was completely buried while two others suffered significant damage to their structures around 3 PM EST.

Miami-Dade County officials have confirmed that an extensive network of sinkholes is responsible for this widespdiscaly, which has experts worried about the possibility of more homes succumbing in future heavy rainfalls or storms typical to Florida's weather patterns during hurricane season. A local geologist explains what likely triggered these sudden collapses: "The intense rain we had last week probably increased groundwater levels, which can destabilize limestone bedrock found underneath many parts of the city."

Local homeowner Maria Gonzales watched in horror as her family's house disappeared beneath their yard. Moved by despair and urgency to secure a safe place for everyone, she says they had left their property early that afternoon after noticing minor ground subsidence before leaving but were still shocked when the entire area abruptly vanished within minutes of heavy rainfall starting around noon hours: "I could hear my daughter crying as we watched her favorite doll fall into one hole and then heard a huge crash. We knew something was terribly wrong."

Residents in affected areas report feeling small tremors or hearing rumbling sounds prior to the sinkhole occurrence, though none saw signs that would have led them to suspect an impending collapse of their homes' foundations according to University of Miami professor Dr. John Haley who specializes in environmental engineering: "Sinkholes are often hard to detect until they fully form due to Florida’s unique landscape where limestone bedrock lies close to the ground surface."

In an effort to provide immediate assistance and assurance, local authorities have opened a relief center on Oak Avenue this morning. A representative from Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez's office tells CNN they are working closely with FEMA officials for support plans as well: "We understand that our residents may feel vulnerable during these difficult times but please know there is always hope, we will provide help and guidance along every step."

Experts continue to study the sinkholes while homeowners begin assessing damage alongside insurance adjusters. The ongoing investigation into this widespread geological disaster raises concerns about potential safety issues during future extreme weather events common in Florida's seasonal climate, as Miami-Dade County is already bracing for hurricane risks starting early next week: "Climate change has exacsperated the frequency and intensity of natural disasters across our country. We cannot ignore this trend any longer."
