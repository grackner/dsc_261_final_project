China has reported a record-setting influx of tourists this year as international travel continues to recover from COVID restrictions, with Beijing's Forbidden City witnessing near capacity levels during peak hours on weekends (2023). Tourism data released by the Chinese government reveal an unprecedented 14% increase in visitors compared to last year.

Officials attribute this surge not only to pent-up demand but also to a robust domestic market and relaxed travel policies within China itself, as well as some easing of regulations for overseas tourists (2023). "We are cautiously optimistic about the growth," said Liu Fangjun, director general at Beijing's Tourism Administration.

The Forbidden City – a UNESCO World Heritage site in central Beijing and one of China’s top tourist attractions since it was opened to the public by Mao Zedong over six decades ago on October 1, 1983 (2023) — is now among these most-visited landmarks. "The lines extend far beyond the entrance halls at times," said Ms. Liu during a recent press conference held last Friday in Beijing's city hall and attended by foreign diplomats, business leaders, and journalists from around the world (2023).

Experts argue that this influx is likely to continue growing as more countries ease their travel restrictions on China. The National Tourism Administration has revised its forecast for 2024 tourist arrivals in Beijing by an additional 8% over the initial projection (2023).

"China's resilient economy and vibrant culture have always drawn people from all corners of the globe. We believe that with sustained efforts to ensure safety measures, we will maintain our position as a global tourism leader," concluded Ms. Liu during her interview.
