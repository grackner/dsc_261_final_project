In a stunning upset that will echo through college football history books, No. 5 North Carolina State Wolfpack defeated No. 2 Clemson Tigers on their home field last Saturday night at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte. This unprecedented victory by the underdogs against one of the nation'in elite teams has catapulted NC State to a spot as an undefeated team, with both quarterbacks being named Big Four All-American Awards recipients this season and breaking numerous records set previously by college football legends.

The Wolfpack started slowly but gained momentum throughout halftime when they switched from their traditional spread offense to a smashing ground game that saw them score two touchdown runs within the first five minutes of play, something Clemson quarterback D’Brickashaw Ferguson hadn't seen before in his time at NC State.

"I knew our team had it when we went on offense for a change and took to that ground game," said Head Coach Jim Hickey post-game, who was instrumental during halftime of the momentum shift with strategically altered plays calling extra timeouts before implementing his daring run.

NC State running back Jamie Moore (280 yards) shattered records for single-season rushing yardage and total touchdown runs by a freshman player since NCAA began recording such stats in 1973, while quarterback Drew Anderson also had noteworthy contributions with his arm skill.

Clemson coach Terry Price commented on the unexpected outcome: "I respect NC State's effort tonight and acknowledge that we were overwhelmed by their strong defense." Coach Price has faced challenges in recruiting, but he remains confident for future games as a result of this loss. 

NC State is set to face No. 24 Duke Panthers on Thursday at home where they hope to continue this winning streak and cement their place among college football's elite teams before heading into the Atlantic Coast Conference championship game against top-ranked Florida State Seminoles in mid-December, making it an important week for NC State’s fanbase.

This win has not only shocked Clemson supporters but also sports pundits and analysts nationwide who have been anticipating a rematch of the infamous 1980 "Fog Bowl." The Wolfpack's victory over one-seeded, undefeated Clemson in this season will be remembered as an incredible feat.

As for NC State players and coaching staff celebrating their unexpected triumph at Bank of America Stadium after last Saturday night’s game against No. 2 Clemson Tigers: “We knew we had the talent but executing on both offense and defense in a way that no one saw coming was not something I thought would happen, especially here,” said Hickey amidst laughter from his teammates who have now become role models for many young athletes.

It remains to be seen how this victory will affect NC State's ranking on the AP Poll board and whether they can carry through their momentum into next season. One thing is certain: college football has just been given another unforgettable storyline with North Carolina State Wolfpack defying odds in what many are calling "a game for the history books."

"This win doesn't merely change our expectations but also challenges us to rethink
