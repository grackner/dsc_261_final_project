A massive traveler strike in Madrid is set to start on Monday morning at midnight and could last up to a week according to officials from Spain's national transport authority. The stoppage follows negotiations between the union representing bus drivers and government representatives which have yet to be resolved as of this writing, though both sides are still trying hard for compromise solutions that would prevent disruinous strike action across public transit in one of Europe’s most visited cities (aside from London).

Traveler Strike Set To Begin In Madrid This Weekend; Union Says Protest Is Over Pay Rises, Working Conditions 

Spain's main national transport authority is not pleased about this impending halt to essential services: A protest by bus drivers in Spain will begin on Monday morning at midnight and could extend up until the following Sunday evening. The strike has been announced after days of negotiations between representatives from a union that represents more than 18,000 public transportation workers within Madrid's Metropolitan Community Transport Company (TUMA) — which includes taxis as well—and officials representing both parties in talks; however neither side was immediately willing to release their final demands for discussion.

"It seems that we are stuck at a deadlock without any progress on how things can change," said Luis Fernandez, head of the Transport Workers Union (UATT) and spokesperson during an official press conference where he spoke about this latest protest action being his third attempt to push for better pay rises since 2018 when labor issues first surfaced within TUMA.

While officials from Spain's national transport authority have not commented much on what the potential impact would be if public transit services were halted—aside from saying that buses and taxis should still operate due to their importance for daily commuters in Madrid who travel an average of 30 miles per day--a representative speaking at this press conference did express concern about delays across various departments within the city government if they have not found a resolution by end-of-week:

"We cannot afford disruptions during our crucial time for infrastructure investment and service improvements," said Maria Gomez, head of public affairs department at Madrid's transport authority. "It’s imperative that we address this issue swiftly." 

The union representing bus drivers in Spain has been vocal about their demands for pay rises over the years; however now they say it extends to fairer working conditions as well, pointing towards concerns regarding job security and workload due mainly from a sharp rise of tourists visiting Madrid annually. The official unemployment rate within city limits currently stands at 6%; but there are whispers among experts about an uptick in illegal employment practices being adopted by businesses struggling financially as many fear it could be impacted heavily due to decreased local and international travel resulting from recent global events like the pandemic.

Union officials have agreed upon seeking temporary solutions, including flexible shifts for their members while they continue bargaining over better wages without sacrificing quality service delivery across different lines of buses throughout Madrid (as well as other forms such taxis). Union representatives also emphasized that this strike will be peaceful and cooperative in spirit since public safety remains the utmost priority.
