In a daring military operation on Tuesday night in eastern Ladakh near Galwan Valley where Chinese and Indian troops are engaged since last year's stand-off, India successfully carried out surgical strikes against alleged terror camps inside Pakistani territory along the Line of Control. The precise timing remains undisclosed but reportedly took place under cover of darkness between 8:00 PM to midnight IST as part of Operation Rakshak by Indian armed forces, aiming at dismantling cross-border militancy and terrorism fuelled activities against New Delhi'in interests.

Military sources informed CNN that around a dozen high altitude mountain passes along the Line of Control were stormed without prior intelligence gatherings or notice as part of an extensive three-prong attack, including air strikes on enemy ammunition stockpiles and artillery emplacements in PoK. 

The operation followed weeks of intense dialogue between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's National Security Adviser Ajit Doval with his Pakistani counterpart Moeed Yusuf, where both sides expressed a commitment to resolving the long-standing border dispute through peaceful negotiations. This was seen as an opportunity for India and Pakistan - once bitter enemies in 1965 war over Kashmir —to build upon recent progress toward deescalation of tensions after months of stalled talks due to alleged provocative acts on both sides including frequent exchanges along the LoC.

Defence sources confirmed that Indian special forces, also known as Greyhounds or Parakramis were deployed for this mission with air cover provided by Sukhoi-30 MKIs and Mirage 2000 fighter jets based out of Bagmati Air Base in Srinagar. As per local reports from the Pakistani side, no casualties have been reported due to alleged compliance of ceasefire agreements by both Pakistan Army and paramilitary forces deployed near LoC as well as civilian populations along those border regions which witness daily cross-border traffic between India's Jammu & Kashmir region and Gilgit Baltistan province in Punjab.

India maintains that these incursions inside PoK are part of an ongoing effort to counter the terrorist threat posed by militant groups like Lashkar e Taiba (LeT) who Pakistan allegedly supports financially through smuggling across Jammu and Kashmir region, including drug trafficking as well. Indian officials have stated that their forces are following orders given under Article 370 of the Constitution - allowing regional governments like J&K Autonomous Administrative Bodies with limited power over local affairs to give consent for such action against cross-border militancy fuelled activities targeted specifically at India itself without direct permission from New Delhi.

Eyes remain fixed on both capitals as leaders continue their dialogue towards finding long term solutions that could address root causes behind border dispute, terrorism and smuggling issues plaguing region along Line of Control where Siachen glacier - one of world's highest battlefields mark eastern Ladakh frontier.

In an interview with The Tribune Newspaper last weekend Ajit Doval expressed hope that this operation would set right India-Pakistan equation for long term peace and prosperity in South Asia: "If we can establish confidence building measures between two nations like us who have shared common history but
