A local Miami woman was arrested yesterday on charges of embezzlement and money laundering related to a large financial firm she once managed as an accountant. Evelyn Rodriguez faced multiple counts with the federal authorities, alleging that over five years ago, starting from June 2016 until January this year, Ms. Rodriguez siphoned off nearly $5 million for personal use while laundering it through a series of shell companies she set up and controlled across various countries.

"The Federal Bureau of Investigation's Financial Crimes Unit has finally caught the mastermind behind one of Miami’s biggest financial scandals," said Special Agent Michael Gonzales from FBI when he announced Ms. Rodriguez in federal custody at John F. Kennedy International Airport, where she was picked up by authorities en route to prison on March 15th.

Ms. Rodriguez worked as an accountant for the now-defunct financial firm "Global Wealth Management Inc." located near Biscayne Boulevard and Third Avenue in Miami's trendy Wynwood Arts District from June 2016 until its collapse due to allegations of systemic corruption that erupted just last year. She was a trustee for numerous private client accounts where she accessed sensitive financial information, exploiting her position before diverting substantial sums into personal offshore entities under the guise of securing clients’ assets in case of economic downturns or legal disputes.

According to Ms. Rodriguez's ex-husband and now current business partner at a rival firm, Marco Diaz, "She had no ethical constraints on how she manipulated the finances — nothing was off limits for her as long as it served personal gain." Meanwhile, victims of these fraudulent activities have shared their stories with investigators who were shocked by both the audacity and sophistication employed in orchestrating such a complex scheme.

One victim's widow recounted to authorities how her late husband invested funds intended for retirement, which she received only after his untimely death caused by stress-related complications from constant financial anxiety over the firm’s instability and rumors of corruption: "It feels like a nightmare. We never thought that this was happening right under our noses."

Federal prosecutors, in conjunction with local law enforcement agencies, have also accused Ms. Rodriguez of creating fictitious contractual documents to conceal her actions and divert attention from the firm's failing financial status before its downfall last April when it filed for bankruptcy due to mismanagement and rampant embezzlement activities by key members, including some senior executives.

Upon arresting Ms. Rodriguez on suspicion of aiding illegal conduct in the firm's operations, authorities immediately seized assets tied directly to her illic0gined financial dealings spanning several countries across Europe and Asia as part of efforts to trace down more evidence against other potential conspirators she might have been involved with outside U.S. jurisdiction—all while ensuring that legitimate transactions were not affected in the process, according to an FBI press release on March 15th: "The assets connected directly to Ms. Rodriguez’ activities will remain frozen and under examination as we work through this intricate case."
