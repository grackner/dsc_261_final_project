In a stunning announcement yesterday, President Biden confirmed his third trip to Morocco in less than six months with an eye-opening visit aimed at reinvigorating the U.S.-Moroccan partnership and discussions about shared security concerns over migration from sub-Saharan Africa. This unexpected decision has sparked dialogue amongst analysts, experts, and officials who speculate on its significance for bilateral relations moving forward into 2024 elections year when the U.S.' foreign policy priorities are set to be reassessed in detail by Congress.

Amidst a whirlwind of diplomatic activities this weekend was President Biden's trip, which took him from Marrakech International Airport at dawn yesterday after addressing business leaders and urging companies on cybersecurity matters earlier that morning—an unusual prelude to the three-nation European tour.

"The U.S.-Morocco relationship has been strong for decades and continues as an important pillar of stability in the region," said David L. McKeon, former senior director at The National Security Council who worked on US-Middle East policy during Obama's tenure when Moroccan King Mohammed VI hosted a state dinner with President Barack Obama here back home last year—one month after their first meeting since 2019 amid renewed U.S.-Morocco dialogue efforts focusing on security and migration concerns over the past two years of Joe Biden's presidency to date in addition to bilateral trade relations across sectors such as agriculture, manufacturing tourism services finance energy among others that benefit both parties economically while helping create jobs for locals," McKeon stressed.
