In a dramatic turn of events in New Delhi last Thursday night, a powerful cyberattack crippled numerous government websites and disrupted essential public services for over 12 hours before full functionality was restored later that evening. The digital onslaugstatic attack began just after midnight when employees reported slowed internet speeds across several departments within the Central Government Information Technology Department at Rashtrapati Bhavan, India's Presidential Palace complex in New Delhi (BBC).

Minister of State for Communications Shri Sachin Dave addressed a press conference shortly after reports emerged about what he termed "a major cyber intrusion." He stated that the attackers exploited vulnerabilities within government systems to gain access. The Ministry immediately activated its Cyber Incident Response Team, which worked tirelessly throughout the incident duration without pause until their efforts were successful in regaining control of all affected IT infrastructure on Saturday morning (Wired).

"It's a significant breach," said former cybersecurity expert Dr. Rakesh Gupta at Delhi University who had been following developments closely, noting that the sheer scale of this particular attack was unprecedented in India’s history until now."We haven't seen anything quite like it; our entire digital infrastructure being brought to its knees because something as simple-seemingly common - a cyberattack," said Dr. Gupta, who has since retired after the incident (India Today).

In an emergency meeting held last Friday afternoon at 2:01 PM local time by Home Minister Rajnath Singh and his team of top officials from various ministries involved directly or indirectly with cybersecurity in New Delhi's Raisina Hall, a comprehensive strategy to combat this formidable intrusion was devised. The plan included immediate actions such as isolating the affected servers for investigation purposes while maintaining uninterrupted public services via alternate routes where available (The Indian Express).

"We are working round-the-clock with our IT Department, private sector partners and global cybersecurity firms to identify those responsible," Singh told reporters at the closed-door session attended by several cabinet members along with senior advisors. He later tweeted about their commitment in fighting back against these malicious actors on Saturday morning: "Our relentless pursuit for justice will not stop until we bring them to book."

Meanwhile, officials from the National Informatics Centre (NIC), which manages most of India's IT services and infrastructure including those that experienced disruptions during this cyberattack continue investigations on their end. Their initial analysis indicates multiple intrusion points across different systems; however, they are yet to identify an exact source within the country or beyond its borders (Times Now).

"As soon as we have identified specific vulnerabilities and exploited entry paths used by these hackers - then only can we start devising strategies for safeguarding against similar future attacks," said Kishore Maheshwari, NIC's Director General. He further emphasized the need to strengthen cyber defenses immediately: "The first line of defense lies within us – our human resilience coupled with robust technological infrastructure."

With over 20 government websites going down during this incident and essential public services like passport issuance, healthcare appointments among others severely affected for around twelve hours starting at midnight on Thursday until the rest
