A group of British tourists in Tuscany were left shaken by a culinary mishap last Thursday when they discovered that their alleged organic farm-to-table meal contained non-organic, genetically modified food products not listed on the menu. The incident at Il Canto del Gusto (The Voice of Taste) restaurant in Siena left guests feeling deceived and sparked conversations about authenticity and transparency in dining experiences around Italy's wine country known for its rich culinary heritage.

Authorities have opened an investigation into the incident after receiving multiple complaints from patrons who claimed they had been misled by menu descriptions that promised a farm-to-table experience but failed to meet expectations when it came time to eat their meal, reports ABC News. Inspectors are currently examining records and interviewing staff at Il Canto del Gusto in an attempt to understand how non-organic ingredients ended up on the menu of a restaurant that bills itself as championing organic farming practices throughout Europe' endangered species habitats by misleadingly labeling their food products.

"No guest should ever have doubts about what they are consuming when dining out, especially here in Italy where gastronomy is considered an art," said Mayor of Siena Giorgio Rossi to CNN Italian during a press conference on Monday regarding the incident at Il Canto del Gusto restaurant. "We must ensure that local restaurants uphold transparency and honesty with their guests, or they risk damaging our prestigious reputation as culinary hotspot."

Maria Bianchi from New York City was among those affected by this latest episode in the Italian gastronomic saga when she arrived for dinner at Il Canto del Gusto on Thursday night. "We were thrilled to find a place that claimed they used only organic and locally-sourced produce," said Bianchi, who shared her experience via social media with over 50 likes within hours of posting the picture which showed vegetables she thought were freshly harvested but actually originated from genetically modified fields.

Chef Federico Martelli confirmed that he had purchased non-organic produce on several occasions due to supply chain disruptions caused by recent weather events, stating: "We pride ourselves as a family run business and want our guests happy; sometimes we make decisions based more emotionally than financially. But I understand now it has consequences."

Local culinary expert Alessandro Rossi stressed the importance of maintaining authenticity when promoting farm-to-table meals, "Farm-to-table dining means sourcing locally and respecting both environment while educating consumers about their food choices," he said. However, in light of this incident at Il Canto del Gusto restaurant the Siena Food Safety Committee plans to review local restaurants' ingredient sourcing policies regularly from now onwards with officials already scheduling surprise inspections for next month as reported by Italian Business Times.

In response to growing concerns over their organic practices, Il Canto del Gusto management has pledged to revise menus accordingly and ensure better communication between chefs and suppliers in the future; they apologized on Friday night after a lengthy discussion with customers about what had gone wrong during service. 

"We understand how distressing this experience must have been for our guests," said General Manager Laura
