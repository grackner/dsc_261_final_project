As dawn broke over New York City on April 15th, a controversial fashion show took center stage at Madison Square Garden. Over two hours into the event featuring high-end designer outfits from Paris and Milan, an uproar arose when it was revealed that some models were not paid for their appearances—sparking conversations about ethical style design practices within one of the world's fashion capitals.

In what started as a celebration of haute couture, things took a turn last Thursday evening during Fashion Week New York when attendees learned that certain runway models were not compensated for their work despite performing to rave reviews and garnering media attention on social platforms like Instagram. A statement issued by the event organizers cited budget constraints as the reason, but several industry professionals are now urging brands across all levels of fashion design circles about fair wages in what some say will be an eye-opening experience for many involved in haute couture and ready-toinfluenced trends.

An anonymous stylist who attended a preliminary rehearsal shared, "The energy was electric; everyone wanted to see this show—but seeing runway models backstage without pay made me uncomfortable." With Fashion Week events traditionally bringing in thousands of dollars per model for talent alone, industry experts were shocked at the revelation.

"These are not amateur students putting themselves out there," said fashion historian Dr. Samantha Lee to CNN New York reporters on Friday morning after a visit from several affected models and backstage workers who had shared their stories with her team of researchers during breaks throughout Fashion Week shows across the city, "but professional artists whose work is valued—and often paid handsomely."

The latest incident comes as industry insiders grapple to understand how such unethical behavior could be happening in an era where social media has given a platform and voice not only for consumers but also workers within the fashion world. A prominent model who was among those affected shared her experience with DailyMail, "It's hard seeing people you admire on stage getting paid while others like us are left without pay."

Fashion Week is meant to showcase innovation and celebrate design; however these issues have brought backstage realities into the light. One fashion reporter covering Fashion Weeks for decades shared their perspective, "This shows that there's a lot more work happening behind-the-scenes than many think—and it needs our attention too."

As industry professionals weigh in on this latest episode of runway controversies over the past decade, one thing is clear: The fashion world must prioritize fair and ethical style design practices now. Many are calling for systemic changes to ensure such incidents don't happen again—or if they do occur promptly addressed by all stakeholders involved in Fashion Weeks across the globe every year since 2016, when similar concerns were first raised at New York shows but seemed forgotten amidst the glitz and glamour.

Though still unfolding as organizers review their policies moving forward next season's events alongside industry peers—there is hope among advocates for fashion that this moment will bring much-needed change within haute couture circles to create a more equitable space where every artist involved in the creation of beauty on runway knows they are valued and paid fairly.
