"In a shocking incident yesterday in San Francisco's bustling Union Square, an overzealous individual climbed onto a busy tour bus and proceeded to scream obscenities at passengers onboard for more than three hours before being arrested," reported the CNN International Bureau Chief. The disturbance started around 10:30 AM PST when local resident John Doe was spotted taking his daily constitutional through Union Square, but things took a turn when he decided to get off and take over the popular GoGreen tour bus route No.24 instead of returning home alone on Saturday morning.

According to witnesses who were also commuters at the time, John Doe first alighted from platform 3 around ten minutes later than usual after waiting for what he thought was a crowded train service running along West Portal Avenue and Haight Street before taking matters into his own hands by boarding bus No.24 which normally carries up to 50 tourists throughout the day, most of whom are on excursions in popular destinations like Alcatraz or Sausalito Harbor from Union Square terminal located between Market St and Powell St downtner.

"When I first saw this guy hopping onto bus No.24 without a ticket — mind you he had nowhere else to go - his obnoxious behavior immediately escalated," recounted 37-year old tourist Jane Smith, who was riding on the same route with her family at that time but got off early when they heard commotion unfolding in front of them. "He started throwing insults around and disrupting fellow passengers' peace just after he boarded our bus."

"I didn’t think people would react like this," said another tourist, Tom Anderson as if recalling the day's events when asked about his trip last weekend with friends. "There was never a shortage of locals or visitors here in Union Square; everyone seems to know each other." The disruption began shortly after John Doe had boarded bus No 24 around noon, which caused traffic on the already narrow thoroughfare leading up to Market Street and Fisherman's Wharf.

"I tried talking sense into him," said a tour guide who was approached by law enforcement soon afterwards when trying to reason with John Doe as he took over his assigned route for sightseeing groups, which included multiple trips per day from Union Square station up until sunset hours every Thursday and Sunday. "But things just went downhill quickly after that."

The incident drew immediate attention because of the lengthy duration it lasted – well beyond an hour - when authorities finally took action once they received several calls reporting unusual behavior being displayed by a man who seemed more focused on his antics than taking in Union Square's landmarks or enjoying sightseeing tours offered daily along this iconic route.

Police confirmed that John Doe had voluntarily surrendered himself at the terminal building after standing up for hours while shouting obscenities towards passersby, disrupting other passengers trying to enjoy themselves during what would normally be a peaceful morning commute in Union Square - one of San Francisco's busiest tourist attractions and cultural hubs. "The incident was distressing not just because it took place right here at our terminal station but also due to the sheer length which left us feeling violated," commented Senior Manager Kaitlyn Lee, who works for Union Square Park Management Committee responsible overseeing day-to
