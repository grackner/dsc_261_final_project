In a stunning revelation for travel enthusiasts and critics of overpriced destinations alike, new research has brought to light some of America's most exorbitant hotels in recent years. The study by MoneyHuntTravelers analyzed spending patterns across various tourist-heavy cities during the summer season last year revealing surprising statistics about where money goes when traveling within its own backyard.

The sunny state of Florida, renowned for its beautiful beaches and vibrant culture has some eye-watering numbers that will make many rethink their itinerary next time they plan a trip to the Sunshine State. With an average hotel cost per night reaching well above $500 in cities like Miami Beach, Palm Springs' luxury escapes are not far behind with prices hitting close to six figures for some high-end accommodations at resorts known primarily among Hollywood elites and celebrities.

"We find that travelers spend a significant amount on hotel rooms while vacationing in their own country," says Jennifer Brown, lead researcher of the study who spoke with CNN Travel about her team's astonishing discoveries regarding domestic expenditure during holiddestays among Americans themselves. "Our analysis shows how much money people are shelling out on seemingly affordable trips."

Funded by an anonymous benefactor passionate about promoting responsible travel habits, Brown and her team combed through data from over 200 hotels nationwide to identify the most expensive ones. Their findings highlight how even during peak seasons when tourism is at its highest points across different regions of America - Las Vegas' extravagant casinos are often paired with unbeatable prices for room stays; New York City, which never sleeps and yet maintains an upscale vibe year-round.

However, the revelation comes not only from within but also outside as countries like Australia show no mercy on American visitors when it comes to hotel costs during peak holiday periods - a fact that has travel experts urging tourists to plan their trips more strategically and consider alternative options such as vacation rentals or hostels.

"It's time for Americans who want affordable domestic destinations to think twice before booking high-end hotel rooms," says Johnathan Green, a senior editor with TravelAffordablyNow newsletter that advocates budget travel within the United States during non-peak seasons while exploring hidden gems offbeat locations.

In light of these findings and as Americans look to stretch their dollars further this summer season when planning domestic vacations - here are some ways tourists can cut costs without compromising on quality: Consider booking accommodation well in advance; use loyalty points or discounts where available at hotels, resorts. Don't forget about Airbnb options that offer unique experiences and cheaper alternatives to typical hotel stays while exploring the culture of local communities instead of staying within tourist areas which can often be expensive as they cater specifically towards visitors rather than locals.

These findings have sparked discussions amongst social media users, travel bloggers alike who are now questioning where their money is actually going when planning domestic trips and whether the extravagance in price equates to value for most holidaymakers as some argue that spending a couple of thousand dollars on a luxurious hotel room can quickly add up during long vacations.
