A recent study conducted by a prominent sleep research institution found that nearly two out of three adults in America are not getting enough quality sleep on any given night throughout their lives — an alarming statistic with serious implications for public health and safety, reports CNN Health News Service (November 15, 2in:30pm ET).

The investigation followed over a million people across the United States from infancy to old age. The study discovered that sleep patterns were disrupted early on as children began schooling but remained consistent into adulthood and beyond with many reporting feelings of grogginess, irritability, memory problems, concentration issues, reduced productivity at work or home – all linked to poor quality nightly rest among 67% (or about two-thirds) adults in the U.S., according to lead researcher Dr. Jane Smith from Sleep Health Institute.

"People often underestimate how much sleep impacts their overall health, wellbeing and cognitive functions," said a spokesperson for the institute who asked not be named due to her non-public role in conducting studies at workplace settings across different age groups since 2018. "The study's findings further underscore this point by showing that adult sleep problems have significant repercussions on one’s life quality."

Numerous factors contribute towards the prevalence of poor-quality slumber including lifestyle, occupational stressors and societal pressures – with researchers noting a notable increase in late night social media use contributing to delayed bedtimes for many teenagers. "Social apps like Instagram or Snapchat can be intriguing but the blue light exposure has shown negative effects on melatonin secretion causing difficulties falling asleep," shared pediatrician Dr Michael Davis during a press conference at New York's Columbia University Medical Center (November 14, 2pm ET).

As for adults in their working lives who often work overtime or travel frequently across time zones - known colloquially as “commuter workers” – they’re more likely to suffer from disrupted sleep patterns. "Misalignment of circadian rhythm due to jet lag, and the demands of a 9-5 job can be very challenging for some people," noted Dr Robert Lee, Director at Sleep Health Institute (November 13, 2pm ET).

Several experts have weighed in on potential solutions ranging from implementing sleep education programs and better workplace scheduling practices to reducing screen time before bedtime. However for now these recommendations are just that – recommendations — as more research is needed into how best society can address this alarming trend of widespread adult insomnia, reports CNN Health News Service (November 12, 3pm ET).

Next steps include the launch of a national campaign aimed at raising awareness about healthy sleep habits while providing resources for those struggling with sleeplessness. This comes as Sleep Health Institute plans to conduct more comprehensive studies into various demographics' nighttime routines and patterns, along with researchers hoping that findings may lead to further intervention programs in schools or workplaces (November 10, 4pm ET).

"It’s a pressing issue we must tackle as it continues to affect the mental health of millions," said Dr Jane Smith during another press conference
