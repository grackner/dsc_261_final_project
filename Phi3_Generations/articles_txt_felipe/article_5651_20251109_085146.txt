The Golden Four received praise from industry experts watching backstage as they rehearsed between taking breaks in the recording studio nearby where their songs were being recorded with top music producers and engineers to ensure an impeccable sound that stands out on social media platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube.

"Music has been my refuge since I was young," said Samantha Diaz, who had overcome bouts of anxiety through her art and now hopes to use it as part of the healing process for others like herself on 'Golden Minds.'

I never expected this level of support when battling mental health issues – it means the world to me." Meanwhile, Derek Johnson discussed incorporating social media into The Golden Four’s journey towards musical success on 'Golden Minds.'
