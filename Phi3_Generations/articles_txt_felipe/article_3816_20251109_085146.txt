In a groundbredependent journey that highlighted advancements in space technology and international cooperation, NASA's Perseverance rover successfully collected its first Martian soil sample today on Sol 30 (March 15). This critical step has opened new doors for exploring the red planet’s geological history.

"This is a historic day not just for Mars but also humanity as we embark upon interplanetary research and colonization efforts," said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson, commenting on Perseverance's achievement after today’s successful soil sampling process was carried out in Jezero Crater.

It has been a long road to this significant milestone for the rover which landed last February at 3:55pm ET (20:55 GMT) on what NASA refers to as "Sol 1," or Martian Solar Day, marking its first day of operation. Since then it has been steadily trekking across Mars’ Jezero Crater and performing a variety of scientific experiments designed by an international team composed mostly of American scientists but including researchers from France's Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), Italy, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) among others.

The rover has been exploring Jezero Crater since it landed because NASA and its international partners believe the area could once have housed a river delta on Mars' surface billions of years ago—and may still harbor signs that life was ever possible there, despite being barren today due to subsurface ice melt.

Perseverance had been using one of two instruments it carries for this mission — the Mastcam-Z stereo pair camera and SuperCam microscope system which enables scientists back on Earth analyze samples down at Mars' surface directly, said Josh Savill, a geologist with the University College London who helped design instrumentation that Perseverance is carrying.

The rover collected its first sample from what looks like dry bedrock and rocky outcroppings — some resembling boulders in Earth’s badlands or canyon networks on Mars' surface, he said through an interview with NASA officials today about the team's excitement at collecting this new data. "It would be great to find microscopic organisms that may have been fossilized into rocks like these and preserved."

This accomplishment follows Perseverance’s first Mars rock-watch in February, which led scientists to discover carbonate minerals on a surface previously thought not capable of preserving such features because they were too acidic for them. This could prove crucial if we hope one day see humans walking among Martian rocks and dust clouds billowing up from their boots as the planet continues its own natural history, scientists say while being cautious about jump to any final conclusions regarding past life yet finding traces that will hopefully help human settlers better understand possible resources for water or energy on Mars.

The Perseverance rover is carrying two sampling systems — one in which it drilled small cores with a drill bit, and another called the PIXL (Planetary Instrument for X-ray Lithochemistry) that scans rock surfaces using an x-ray fluorescence method. It has been traveling at about 100 meters per hour on Martian terrain thanks to its wheels designed by engineers back in California with a strong emphas
