On Tuesday evening in downtbonville, Florida, at least three guests fell ill with symptoms of food poisoning shortly after dining at The Seaside Inn, a popular local restaurant known for its fresh seafood and excellent service (Florida Health Department on the incident). As word spread through social media about several diners feeling unwell within hours post their meal from last night around 7 pm to midnight near Disney World area.

"The symptoms were immediate," said Dr. Emily Stanton, a local physician who treated some of the affected individuals overnight at her downtown clinic before being transported by ambulance. "Nausea and vomiting that lasts for more than 24 hours is not uncommon with foodborne illnesses like this."

An initial investigation conducted on Wednesday revealed an apparent case of seafood-related sickening, as per reports from the state's health department. Officials are currently reviewing surveillance footage and interviewed staff members to pinpoint where exactly in their kitchens or preparation areas food safety protocol was violated during service hours on Tuesday night when The Seaside Inn served over 200 patrons, a mix of locals seeking respite from Disney World crowds.

"We pride ourselves on our fresh catch and quality meal options," said Johnathan Harper, the restaurant owner who has managed to keep his establishment thriving in downtonville for more than two decades now but is currently shaken by this unforeseen incident as per local residents' reactions through social media. "We take cleanliness and food safety seriously."

The Florida Health Department, which released its statement on Thursday, shared that three of the affected guests were treated at St. Thomas Hospital after exhibiting symptoms like fever with severe vomiting or diarrhea—classic signs indicating a possible case of norovirus infection commonly associated with raw seafood consumption (Norovirus is often referred to as "the stomach flu" and can spread rapidly among people who eat contaminated food).

As for the diners themselves, many shared their experiences on social media platforms after witnessing others fall ill shortly following dinner at The Seaside Inn. One customer noted that while they enjoyed a delightful meal complete with jasmine rice, grilled shrimp skewers and fresh catch of the day from last night around 7 pm to midnight near Disney World area said it felt great until about an hour after eating when several diners started expressing their discomfort.

"I was fine during dinner but couldn't sleep for hours as I had terrible stomach cramps," shared Sarah Wilson, who dined with her family and friends at The Seaside Inn last night near Disney World area (Sarah is now quarantining herself after displaying symptoms). "It felt like everyone else in our group also got sick soon afterwards."

A local resident's post on Facebook garnered over 200 reactions within minutes:

"I can’t believe this happened. We trusted The Seaside Inn and now we find out they might have served contaminated seafood," wrote Jane Doe, who experienced the same symptoms as Sarah after dining with her family of four last night around 7 pm to midnight near Disney World area (Jane is currently home resting in bed).
