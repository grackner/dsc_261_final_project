A powerful hurricane has made landfall in South Carolina as a category four storm with wind speeds exceeding 130 mph, CNN reports. The massive Hurricane Zara arrived at the coast early Tuesday morning local time (March 28th) and is expected to bring torrential rains along with extensive flooding across areas already struggling from recent weather events.

Residents in low-lying regions have been evacuated, as emergency services scramble to prepare for the storm'neruptions'. Meteorologists warn that Zara could cause a significant spike in insurance claims and economic losses along with serious infrastructural damage due to flooding and wind.

Emergency Management Director of Charleston City Hall, Elizabeth Thompson says "We are bracing for the worst-case scenario as Hurricane Zara is one of the strongest storms on record in this region." The hurricane warning center reported that rainfall amounts could reach up to 15 inches over a few days' time across Charleston, Savannah and Atlanta areas.

"We understand how terrifying it must be for those currently affected by the flooding," said Governor Michael Evans of Georgia during his afternoon press conference in Washington D.C., adding "Our top priority is to ensure safety first." 

Scientists from NOAA's Climate Prediction Center warned that Zara has formed under unique weather conditions, suggesting it may become a long-lasting storm system over the next week or two as an atmospheric river continues through North America. "We see these kinds of hurricanes forming in late spring and early summer on rare occasions," said Dr. Jennifer Foster, chief meteorologist at NOAA's NHC in Miami Florida during a Tuesday afternoon interview with CNN.

The National Weather Service issued flash flood warnings across the Carolinas for heavy rains expected to begin Wednesday evening local time and continue through Friday night. Residents are urged not only to secure their homes, but also stay off roads as water levels rise rapidly in low-lying areas with frequent updates provided by emergency services via social media platforms like Twitter.

Following the immediate threats posed directly from Zara's landfall and flood risks associated with it will likely be recovery efforts spanning months, if not years. "We anticipate significant disruplement across our communities," says Mayor John Davis of Atlanta Georgia who has been coordinating relief operations alongside local officials at the Red Cross shelter set up in a community college gymnasium on Tuesday morning before evacuations began to take effect locally as early Wednesday evening hours approached.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency announced its readiness for potential disaster declarations across three states impacted by Zara, with an emergency response team already dispatched and pre-positioning of additional supplies on the way from their national hubs in Atlanta. "Our priority is ensuring immediate relief while also planning ahead to minimize long-term impact," FEMA Administrator Jonathan Reese told reporters after a morning briefing at Camp Lejeune Marine Corps Base, Northeast Carolina which will serve as Zara's temporary home for storm monitoring and response operations.

As the sun set on Tuesday evening following days of hurricane warnings across three southeastern U.S states with several evacuations ordered in effect by Wednesday morning local time along affected coastal communities, citizens remain vigil
