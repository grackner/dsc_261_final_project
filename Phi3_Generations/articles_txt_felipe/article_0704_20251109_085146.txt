In Beijing this weekend, a devastating earthquake of magnitude 6.5 struck with epicenter just southeast of Guangzhou city on Saturday evening at around 7:30 PM local time (UTC+8). The tremor was felt across much of southern China and beyond, leading to widespdestu aftermaths including the collapse of several older buildings in downtown areas.

Several witnesses reported seeing dust clouds rising from cracked roads while emergency teams rushed out with heavy equipment attempting to restore order amidst chaos on street corners across multiple provinces such as Guangdong, Fujian and Hunan. The Chinese government declared a state of public safety alert in all affected regions until further notice following the initial shock wave accompanied by aftershocks which were felt for hours afterwards even though intensity has since significantly reduced.

A local resident from Shenzhen shared their experiences with CNN: "We heard loud noises outside and then saw things shaking violently before everything started falling apart around us." Another survivor recounted how frightening it was when she thought her grandmother might be crushed under rubble. Thankfully they all escaped unscathed but not without losses of treasured family heirlooms amidst broken glass and debris littering their homes now destroyed by tremors caused nature’s fury coupled with human error during construction practices which experts say contributed significantly to the extent this calamity unfolded.

In response, Premier Li Keqiang met emergency management authorities yesterday morning at Zhongnanhai for a cabinet-level meeting where he ordered government officials in all provincial capitals throughout China's affected regions including Guangdong Province; directing them urgently to coordinate relief efforts via teleconferencing and localized disaster response teams deployed immediately after evaluations of initial damage assessments by city administrators assisted with aerial surveys conducted yesterday evening using drones.

Additionally, President Xi Jinping visited victims in affected cities like Shenzhen later this afternoon alongside Minister Zhang Yesui and Director Wu Zhengbing to provide reassurance as well assurances from his administration that financial assistance programs will be extended for those whose livelihoods have been impacted severely due largely because many were living paycheck-to-paycheek before quake struck without sufficient savings or insurance coverage against natural disaster losses beyond control within local economies heavily dependent on industries such as manufacturing, shipping transportation and service sectors.

As relief operations continue under way across severely impacted southern Chinese provinces – where some are still reporting aftershocks occurring periodically even though strength has significantly decreased over time -- social media posts filled with photos documenting collapsed buildings prompt expressions of solidarity within communities sharing experiences during this unprecedented tragedy, as many have come together to help each other while official rescue efforts are carried out by teams comprising military personnel alongside local emergency services providers.

A spokesperson from the China Earthquake Administration assured that comprehensive seismic monitoring systems were activated immediately after initial shockwaves subsided, leading experts in geological sciences to investigate further into potential fault lines within Southern Mainland areas under study so far include those along Yangtze River Delta regions prone historically for strong earthquakes due mainly because of their proximity close enough yet far away from other seismic hotspots such as Tianjin-B
