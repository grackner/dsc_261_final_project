A massive storm swept through London yesterday afternoon with gusty winds reaching up to 70mph and heavy rainfall causing widespde flooding across the city center since around 3pm local time, CNN reports. Emergency services were mobilized in response as water levels rose rapidly within several hours of onset.

In a statement issued by Mayor Sadiq Khan's office at approximately 4:15 pm yesterday, authorities confirmed that "extreme weather conditions are causing significant disruption and danger to Londoners." The mayor stressed the need for immediate assistance from residents in affected areas as they navigate flooded streets. He further added, “I urge every single person caught up in this catastrophe to prioritize safety above all else.”

Water levels rose at a rate of 1 foot per hour overnight according to figures released by the Thames Water Authority around midnight yesterday local time.

As per the National Weather Service Office (NWSO) report published yesterday, there's a high risk of similar storm patterns recurring throughout Europe this week due to an abnormal jet stream pattern expected around Monday morning EST/GMT+1 time zone when strong polar cold front is anticipated. Scientist Dr Laura Brown with the Royal Meteorological Society shared her concerns over these findings during yesterday’s press conference, “We must remain vigilant and prepared for any future weather extremes as this unusual jet stream pattern seems likely to return.”
