In a historic moment for British athletics, Dina Asher-Smith stormed through to clinch her third Olympic gold medal of life in Tokyo on Monday night's final race at the women’ end of sprinting events. It was here where she put Britain into uncharted territory — not only has this nation won an individual track and field event since 1964, but Asher-Smith delivered her best ever by taking home a new record with blazing speed that set eyes on all the world to witness in exhilaration.

"This is something I've been working towards for years," Asher-Smith said after seizing victory at Tokyo's National Stadium, where fans erupted into cheers as she emerged triumphant from behind her competitors and crossed the line first by just 0.21 seconds in a time of 10.75 s—the world record for women’s 4x100 meters relay was also shattered with an Olympic-record finishing speed to boot, having recorded Asher-Smith's blazing dash at the end as well: 3rd place finishers Jamaica took second in a time of 42.8 s—this marks not only Britain’s first ever women relay gold medal but also their third consecutive for three spots overall after taking bronze last night to make it four straight, which ties back with its recent success and the country's enduring passion for athletics dating from ancient times that even gave them a home advantage.

"We knew we had something special tonight," said coach Dave Brailsford who has been guiding British sprinters since 2012, "It all started when Dina was selected to represent the country." He added with pride in his eyes, reflecting on Asher-Smith's performance, that this run is one for history.

While many celebrated Asher-Smith’s individual victory tonight at ITV Studios Arena and across London social media feeds lit up green as Britons rallied around their own female athlete who had previously inspired so many with her powerful performances in Beijing four years ago, the road to gold for this determined woman began even before that. It was during training runs when she first felt “the hunger and desire” to win one of these coveted medals herself back then; now Asher-Smith has done it on an Olympic night with no small help from her teammates, particularly those who have given up personal glory in favour of British history being made—namely Stina Petitson, Natasha Maynard and Imani Blackwood.

"We're proud to represent not just our country but the generations that came before us," shared former world 200-meter champion Jamaica national team member Mandy Mattern whose own Olympic dreams of silver medal glory were sidelined in favour for her compatriots’ historic achievement today, after helping set a stiff pace early on with Dina at the tail end as they clocked out around 42.3 seconds into Tokyo's hot summer night; although Mandy had finished third place herself last year to secure silver behind Usain Bolt and Tianna Madison in London back then too, she now stands beaming next to Asher-Smith amidst roars of approval from fans cheering on the world’s first ever women relay gold medalists as they receive their well-deserved award for Tokyo 2021.
