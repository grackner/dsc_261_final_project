In a striking turn of events at this year's World Cup in Qatar, Lionel Messi announced his retirement just days into the tournament on Thursday, July 14th. The Barcelona legend played his last professional match against Tunisia before heading home to Lausanne for what will be one final appearance with FC Basel as he seeks new challenges at age 35.

"This was a difficult decision," said Messi in an emotional statement made during halftime, according to club reporters present. "But football has always been my life and I owe it all to the beautiful game." The announcement comes on the heels of his Barcelona exit last month after 26 years with La Liga's most successful team — ending a career in which Messi scored more than 700 goals, including five Champions League titles.

Messi will play one final official appearance for FC Basel against AEK Athens this coming Sunday before taking his talents to the Swiss club Young Boys next season. The Argentine has already impressed during tryouts and could earn promotion back into La Liga where he won numerous accolades with Barcelona, Chelsea, Inter Milan, Paris Saint-Germain, as well as Real Madrid for a short stint before joining his native Argentina'sel Belgrano youth system.

"We are thrilled to have Lionel on board," said Young Boys president Peter Wolf during Friday training camp at Hodtbach Stadium in Zurich where Messi joined FC Basel from Ajax and then Chelsea, Inter Milan among others before joining Barcelona as a teenager after being loaned out by Argentina's top club.

"He is one of the best players we have ever had," Wolf said with admiration evident in his voice. "We are looking forward to what he brings us here." Messi last played professionally for Argentina during Copa America on June 30th, helping them reach their first-ever final against Colombia before they eventually lost by a score of 1–2 after extra time at Arena Pascua with goals from Carlos Bacca and Gustavo Varela.

Experts weigh in: "Messi has left an indelible mark on the sport," says Dr John Smith, soccer historian and author of 'The Legends Of Soccer.' "His retirement not only marks a significant moment for football fans worldwide but also serves as inspiration to aspiring young athletes."

"I'll always be grateful for his time in La Liga with Barcelona," says local Basel fan, Emma Johnson. "It was incredible seeing him play live and I hope he brings success here too." With the final of FC Basel vs Young Boys scheduled at Stade du Letzigrund on August 10th after Messi's farewell appearance next Sunday against AEK Athens in Greece, fans are eagerly awaiting his transition into Swiss football.

"We appreciate what he has done for us and we wish him the best," says FC Basel manager Patrick Vieira from Switzerland during pre-match press conference last Friday at Hodtbach Stadium where Messi was making waves with Young Boys already this season in League Nacional 1, scoring six goals so far. "I think his legacy will live on as he looks to continue playing and inspiring young talents."

The local community has also stepped forward offering their heartfelt gratitude for the impact that Messi's presence had during FC Basel campaign: He brought fans from
