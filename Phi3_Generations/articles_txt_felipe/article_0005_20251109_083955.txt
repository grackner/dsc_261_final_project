On February 25th, in Chicago's Stapleton Gymnasium during a nationally televised high school basketball game, Derrick Johnson from Central High School made history by scoring an astonishing quadruple-double with his name on the scoreboard - both as part of that feat and for leading his team to their first regional final appearance in over 20 years. With two minutes left into a nail-biting game against Oakwood Prep Academy, Johnson achieved this unprecedented performance by accumulating an impressive double digits in points, rebounds (15), assists (9), and steals (7). His achievement not only secured his team's spot as regional finalist but also broke the school record for triple-doubles set by a player from 20 years ago.

Central High School Coach Mark Davis praised Johnson, stating "Derrick has been an exceptional athlete and student; he represents our program well both on and off the court." He added that his team's progress this season can be attributed to their hard work under Johnston’s guidance. In fact, they have won ten of their last eleven games with Johnson leading from within, proving pivotal in these victories throughout Chicago-area competition. 

A spokespener for Oakwood Prep Academy said that the team was "surprise and disappointed" by Derrick's performance but acknowledged his talent as a force to be reckoned with; he plans not to let this loss dampen their spirits, stating they will continue working towards success.

Johnson's unbelievable stats are not only commendable on their own but also set new records within his school as well, he recorded double digits across four statistical categories during Saturday’s 60-58 win at Stapleton Gymnasium - a first in the Chicago Central High School sports history. “Derrick is an amazing talent,” said former coach and current assistant Jim Thompson who watched Johnson play over ten years ago; "He gives his team such joy, we have seen players before break records but he sets them like nobody's business."
Johnson’s achievement caught the eye of local scouts as well with two NBA recruiters in attendance. Scout Coach Chris Williams commented that “Derrick has a unique mix of size and skills – not many 6-foot players can do what he does on both ends, his stats are among those I've seen at college prep games."
Central High School athletic director Maria Gomez credits the progress to Johnson’s drive since joining Central last year. "He took over a group of misfits and made
