In a series of coordinated attacks targeting religious institutions in Iraq's northern city of Mosul this weekend, at least eight churches have sustained significant damage or been completely destroyed as of Monday morning local time (April 25th). The violence underscCES the escalating sectarian conflict within Baghdad and across other Middle Eastern cities.

In an interview with CNN Arabia, Mosul's mayor Mohammed al-Jabouri lamented: "These acts of terrorism are not only hurting our beloved churches but also fanning the flames of discord in society." Witnesses tell DailyMail they heard gunfire and explosions during these incidents on April 24th, while security footage has captured masked figures carrying AK-47s near two affected cathedrals.

As authorities scramble to provide adequate protection for worshippers attending Mass or prayer gatherings in the area - a traditionally peaceful part of Iraq's Shiite community - several local families spoke out about their concerns on Facebook Live streaming services hosted by CNN and Al Jazeera English.

"I am scared," said Farid Qasem, who shared his video statement with DailyMail as he watched smoke billowing from the site of one attack after another Sunday night while attending a wedding celebration just across town: "These attacks are like nothing we've ever seen before."

Officials confirm that at least three separate explosions occurred on different parts of Old Mosul, but police chief Abu Bakr al-Bukhi says he fears the worst as fighting with ISIS fighters continues to rage in other areas close by. On Saturday night (April 23rd), Iraqi forces recaptured a town near Fallujah just days after they wrested back control of Mosul from militants who took it last summer during an escalation that led thousands more refugees and displaced people into the already overcrowded city.

Al-Bukhi said: "Our troops are doing everything possible to protect civilians in these areas, but ISIS has proven themselves willing killers who target not only military forces but any opposition they encounter." Reports from other cities like Tikrit and Kirkuk detail similar scenes of fear as Iraqis flee conflict zones seeking refuge inside their own homes.

The attacks on Mosul's churches came amid calls for unity between Shiites, Sunnis, and Christians after decades-long intermittent fighting in the region following foreign invasions that began with Iranian involvement during the 1980 Iraq war against a US-led coalition to oust militant forces. But as fears mount over an uptick of sectarian violence across nations from Syria's ongoing civil conflict, analyst John Doyle believes these recent events could mark another chapter in that history if left unchecked: "If Iraq fails internally to address this rising tide of radicalism and division between communities... I fear we are not only looking at Mosul but potentially broader instability throughout the region."

In an article for Al-Monitor, a leading Arab affairs commentary platform founded by former Washington Post reporter Louisa Ali Kandil based in London: "The sectarian strife that has been growing exponentially since 2014 is now taking centre stage once again as ISIS launches its latest attack against religious communities."
