In a startling discovery that has sent ripples across food industries nationwide, traces of an obscure herb were found in over half a million packets of children's meals sold by leading fast-food chains last month (20th March). The National Food Safety Office immediately issued warnings to parents and caregivers after identifying the unapproved ingredient during routine inspections. "The presence of this herb is highly unusual for commercial food products meant specifically for children," said Dr. Lisa Grant, a nutritional expert consulted by investigators in their inquiry into the case that began on 15th March and unfolded over several days amidst increasing public concern about hidden additives in processed meals aimed at young ones. "We must understand how it got there to prevent this from happening again." Parents expressed shock as many voiced fears for their children's health after learning that the herb, believed locally to have medicinal properties and only recently introduced into select restaurants by an ambitious entrepreneur who promised a 'natural edge,' had not been vetted or approved by federal food safety agencies. The concerned father of 8-year-inventor Jonathan Smith shared his thoughts: "I never thought I'd have to worry about my kid eating at McDonald's, but now we all do." As the investigation continues into how these herb packets ended up in children’s meals across major cities like New York and Los Angeles from 50 fast-food restaurants—some of which are nationwide franchises with millions of young customers each year—federal agencies have pledged to implement stricter regulation policies.
