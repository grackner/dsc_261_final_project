In a surprising turn of events at this year's Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, professional ice hockey player Mark Thompson from Canada became an instant celebrity outside the world of sports when he took to social media sharing his unique experience as part of the Olympic Games. During one particular exhibition match on February 9th, which concluded with Canadian athletes securing a victory against their Russian counterparts in front of thousands at the ice rink, Thompson caught sight of an inspiring figure skater's routine that he felt deeply moved by, sparking his desire to share this moment.

The match between Canada and Russia was highly anticipated as both teams had been vying for gold since last year’th World Championships in Stockholm when the two nations faced off with high stakes on their shoulders. The Canadian team brought hope of a repeat victory while Russian skaters sought redemption after losses to host nation South Korea at similar venues, including back-to-back Olympics games during which Canada had been favored but ultimately came up short in securing gold medals for themselves and home fans alike.

Few witnesses expected Thompson's social media post of Russian figure skater Alexandra Petrova performing an imprompt0uarly to the tune of Canadian hockey anthem, "O Canada," at 12:45 p.m., local time on February 9th—just minutes before his team took to the ice for their semifinal match against Sweden—to go viral as quickly and widely as it did with over a million shares in mere hours worldwide within just one day of posting, according to data from social media analytics company Hootsuite.

Thompson's post received widespread support both on Twitter and Reddit: "I couldn’t help but notice that this incredible routine was inspired by Canada playing hockey together," he wrote along with a video clip of Petrova executing the Canadian anthem dance to perfection alongside her usual program.

"As Canadians, we take great pride in our sporting achievements and national identity—that's why I felt compelled to share this moment which encapsulates all that hockey represents for us," Thompson said of his impulsive gesture during an interview with a sports reporter at the Olympics. "I hope it inspires everyone watching, both players and fans alike."

Olympic figure skating officials did not comment on whether or not they would take disciplinary action against Petrova for performing nationalistic choreography outside of her routine; nor were there comments from Canadian hockey federation representatives as to how the moment might affect their team, which ended up winning 4-3 in overtime after a fierce struggle.

Despite his unexpected fame among fans worldwide who found themselves transported back home by Thompson's heartwarming video clip shared online alongside Canadian anthems and symbols of national identity like the maple leaf emblem, hockey journalist Michael Johnson reminded viewers that it was essential to celebrate athletes from around the globe. "This moment should inspire us all—to uplift each other instead of pitting nations against one another in competition," said an expert on sportsmanship and global relations at Harvard University, who viewed Thompson's video online while watching a hockey game during Olympic time off-duty hours from Boston.
