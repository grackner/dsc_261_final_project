San Francisco tech startup FluxTech announced on Monday a groundbreenkraft discovery that could redefine future communication technology with their novel quantum entanglement device. The unveiling ceremony took place at the company's headquarters in Silicon Valley, where engineers demonstrated how data can be transferred instantly across continents without interference or delay using this cutting-edge method on August 15th.

"We are beyond excited to showcase what could revolutionize global communication," said FluxTech CEO Sarah Johnson during the announcement at a press conference full of industry heavyweights and media representatives, according to tech reporters present. "Imagine receiving messages instantly across half the globe without any data loss."

This development is seen as monumental in an era where instantaneous communication can seem increasingly outdated due to congested network infrastructure worldwide. Quantum entanglement - a phenomenon observed when particles become intertwined and affect each other regardless of distance, has been the focal point for this innovation by FluxTech's research team led by physicist Dr. Raymond Liu since early 2018. The breakthrough was made possible with funding from several venture capital firms that specialize in investing in high-risk, disruptive technologies to enhance the speed and security of information exchange globally.

The implications for a quantum leap forward are not just limited to communication; potential applications ranging across cybersecurity protocols could immensely fortify data protection against hackers worldwide according to Dr. Liu, who has dedicated decades researching non-local physics and its practical implementations in real life scenarios since earning his Ph.D from MIT back in 1986.

"It's a remarkable day for innovation; we believe the days of lagging connections are gone," said Johnson as reporters swarmed around her, cameras flashing and microphones on during an exclusive interview afterward at their headquarters nestled amidst some California’s hilly vineyards. She elaborated further stating that FluxTech's device could potentially revolutionize industries beyond communication – from healthcare to finance - where the speed of data transfer can make or break critical operations, especially during emergency situations like natural disaster responses when time is a luxury we don’t have," she continued.

Industry experts seem intrigued but are cautious about this groundbreaking advancement's feasibility and long-term reliability; after all the quantum world itself holds its own mysteries yet to be unraveled, as stated by Professor Emily Clarke from Cambridge University who was invited for commentary on FluxTech’s revelation.

"While I find this discovery fascinating and a significant milestone in terms of what technology can accomplish with quantum mechanics," remarked the expert after meeting Dr. Liu during an interview at Harvard's School of Engineering, "I urge caution as we know there is much about these particles that remain unclear to scientists themselves."

As FluxTech prepares for a series of tests and refinement phases planned over next few months before considering seeking patents and commercializing their device by 2025 if all goes according with the company's projections, one thing remains clear – this breakthrough may mark another significant stride in bridging our world closer together than ever imagined while simultaneously opening up new hor
