An aspiring actress from New York City has made headlines with her breakout role in a new independent film that's gaining critical acclaim on streaming platforms worldwide. Sarah Thompson, just twenty-two years old and originally hailing from Queens, started acting professionally at the tender age of fifteen after moving to Los Angeles for training. Her latest performance as Emily Grant has critics raving about her authentic portrayal and natural screen presence that seems untainted by Hollywood'selfa often criticized culture of excessive make-up and retouching.

"It was effortless watching Sarah Thompson transform into the role, she just oozes confidence on set," said film director James Harris in an exclusive interview with CNN Entertainment Magazine last Saturday evening while discussing his latest project, 'Summer Nights,' which premiered this month at Sundance Film Festival and is now streaming online. 

Growing up amid the diverse landscape of America's largest borough was not without challenges for Sarah; however, she credits her family’s encouragement as one factor contributing to her success: "My parents always told me that if I put my mind to something and worked hard at it – even when things were tough financially or emotionally - everything would work out in the end," said Thompson.

The world watched as Sarah played Emily Grant in 'Summer Nights,' leading critics everywhere from New York Times headlines calling her "a breakthrough performance" to rave reviews at the Toronto Film Festival where she swept awards for Best Actress; all while still working on several projects simultaneously and keeping up with social media updates about life between takes.

Thompson's ascent seems unstoppable, but even amidst successes like this one there are always questions asked by those curious to know more behind celebrity glamor: "What does it really take for an aspiring actress or actor just starting their career in Hollywood?" Thompson answered plainly while speaking with The Daily Mail about her recent experience and goals.
