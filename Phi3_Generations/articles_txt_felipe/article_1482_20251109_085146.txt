EU Parliament Approves Additional Support Measures for Tourism Sector Amidst Pandemic Continuation and Economic Downturn  
June 5th, 2023 - Brussels/Luxembourg – In a decisive move to aid the European Union's tourism industry battered by years of pandemic restrictions coupled with an economic downturn, EU Parliament has approved additional support measures. The comprehensive package includes financial assistance programs and grants for businesses in 27 countries struggling due to reduced travel activities since early 2020 when the coronavirus outbreak hit Europe.

"We need a resilient tourism sector that can bounce back stronger from this crisis," stated EU Parliament President David Sassoli, whose proposal was endorsed by fellow MEPs in an emergency session last night after prolonged discussions on how best to revive travel and boost the economy.

The proposed package includes €50 billion (approximately $51.79 billion) from EU sources alone for small-to-mid sized tourism businesses, hotels particularly hit hard by restrictions in some countries like Spain with more than 20 million visitors annually who rely heavily on international travelers to keep their economies afloat; €30 billion of which will come as grants and loans while another portion would be allocated for developing digital tourism tools.

Another key component consists of easing visa regulations by abolishing the 90-day rule, allowing people from all European countries to travel freely without a long wait or application process within their own continent's borders – something that has become increasingly important as more nations reopen after months spent in lockdown.

"This is an opportunity for us Europeans," commented Dutch MEP Anja Hazeen-Rijmer, whose country was among the first to ease travel restrictions back up when it eased its measures last summer during a national trial run by several municipalities across Flanders and Zeeland provinces in Belgium. "It's not just about saving jobs but also encouraging cultural exchange."

A representative of UNWTO-Europe, an independent agency promoting tourism throughout the continent that provided valuable data on travel behavior to guide policymaking for this package; Miro Korenic stressed how essential it was "to ensure equal access and opportunities across countries within Europe. We want everyone coming here."

The EU Parliament's approval comes as several national governments begin taking steps forward after the summer holidays when most nations had their first taste of normalcy returning since 2019, before restrictions were implemented in response to COVID-19 cases surging once again towards winter. These measures aim not only at reviving travel but also supporting businesses affected by declining international arrivals that have reached as low as half the pre-pandemic level; data from Eurostat shows a drop of almost 40% on average across Europe between January and October this year compared to the same period in 2019.

Several industry leaders praised the package, including British travel trade body Abta chief executive Mark Tanzer: "This is about much more than just keeping our businesses afloat; it's a chance for us all to come back stronger," while Spanish Tourism Secretary Jose Luis Zoreda underscored how critical these measures were for his country which saw tourism accounting for 12% of its GDP and directly employed over one million people before the
