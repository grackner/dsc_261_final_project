In a surprising move on Tuesday evening at around 8 PM local time in New York City's financial district, ABC Tech announced its plans to merge with DEF Enterprises amidst an unprecedent surge of late-night stock trades that drove both companies’ shares through the roof.

The merger news sent shockwaves across Wall Street as trading volume reached all time highs after 6 PM for ABC Tech and a staggering peak at DEF Enterprises just two hours earlier, according to data from Bloomberg's MarketScan service. The CEO of ABC Technologies stated in an interview on CNBC that "this is the best opportunity we have had in years to accelerate our growth plan while capitalizing on DEF’s innovative prowess."

Jane Doe, senior analyst at Fusion Wealth Management and a long-time observer of tech mergers, commented: “The timing couldn't be more fortuitous for the companies involved.” She added that if this trend continues into Wednesday’s trading session "it would create massive wealth creation opportunities."

ABC Tech has not made public their intended market cap post-merger but financial estimates suggest a combined value of around $30 billion, based on yesterday's share prices. The merger is expected to close by the end of this quarter following due diligence and approval from regulators such as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

Business experts have warned of potential market volatility in coming days. Dr. John Smith, a professor at Columbia Business School who has studied corporate mergers extensively believes: “If there’s one thing that history teaches us about these kinds of deals—it's to expect the unexpected and remain cautious.”

While some are eagerly awaiting news on this development, others express wariness given the rapid share surge. With investors still reeling from last month's sell-off in tech stocks due to regulatory concerns about data privacy practices—it remains unclear how ABC Tech’s shares will perform once full details of their merger with DEF Enterprises are revealed later this week.

As for next steps, executives and analysts alike anticipate that both companies' boards will convene an emergency meeting on Thursday to finalize the decision following a comprehensive review by legal teams across Wall Street firms advising them during these crucial hours of negotiation. 

Meanwhile, regulators and financial experts are closely monitoring this unprecedented surge in after-hours trading volumes for ABC Tech and DEF Enterprises with the FTC expressing intent to conduct a thorough investigation into potential
