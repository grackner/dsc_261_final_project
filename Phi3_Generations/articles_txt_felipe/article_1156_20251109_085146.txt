It was just another day for Chef Marco DiAngelo when he decided to take his culinary skills on a new adventure across Europe. Equipped with nothing but an old-world map and the spirit of gastronomic exploration, the chef found himself in Italy this past weekend, ready to uncover local flavors that had evaded him until then. Unfortunately, while embracing the regional cuisine on a quaint streetscape lined with olive groves outside Napoli (September 12), DiAngelo suffered an allergic reaction after tasting dishes containing traces of shellfish—an ingredient he was unaware his body reacted negatively to.

The incident came as shock not only for the chef but also in a tight-knit community where seafood is celebrated and feared due to risks like mercury contaminated fish consumption or, rarely heard of cases such as DiAngelo’s shellfish allergy complication occurring. He shared his experience with CNN's food correspondent: "I always thought I was immune," he told her in the interview aired yesterday evening.

Emergency medical services were swift to respond upon receiving emergency calls that poured into Napoli local dispatch shortly after DiAngelo's first sign of discomfort around 2 PM on Saturday, just as tourists and locals alike prepared for their Sunday lunch tradition with fresh produce from the sea. The chef was immediately transported by ambulance to Campania General Hospital in nearby Nola where he underwent treatment after medical staff confirmed his symptoms of anaphylactic shock. He is currently stable, but doctors have advised a long-term reevaluation and carrying emergency allergy medications while travelling abroad from now onwards.

Allergies to shellfish can cause severe allergic responses in some individuals even with brief exposure without prior knowledge of the condition (CNN). In rare cases, such as this one involving DiAngelo - who has a successful 20-year career specializing mostly in Italian cuisine—he emphasizes he will need to reassess his relationship and comfort level with regional foods.

Experts point out that while shellfish allergy is indeed uncommon, the prevalence of other types like peanut or dairy intolerances among tourists can be found in certain regions worldwide (The Guardian). In Italy alone, it's reported by health authorities at Campania General Hospital that an estimated 1.2 million citizens carry some form of food-related allergy; however, shellfish allergies affect only a minuscule percentage under three thousand nationally per year with just about eight hundred cases annually in the province where DiAngelo found himself (La Repubblica).

As he recovers from his unexpected ordeal within Campania General Hospital's walls—where local Italian physicians also share anecdotes of similar experiences to assure visitors that such incidents are not commonplace here, despite being statistically rare worldwide - DiAngelo remains optimistic about finding new ways and avenues for his culinary explorations. "I learned my lesson," he said during yesterday’s interview with CNN food correspondent as paramedics wheeled him out of the hospital ward where doctors continued to monitor vital signs through nightly checks, ensuring nothing detrimental happens overnight (CNN).
