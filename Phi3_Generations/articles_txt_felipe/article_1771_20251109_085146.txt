A massive storm system sweeping across Florida has left at least seven people dead and caused widespde destruction as of Friday morning local time according to initial reports from emergency responders on the ground. The National Weather Service reported that powerful wind gusts reached upwards of 120 mph in some areas, unleashing a destructive storm surge along coastal regions and resulting in flooded streets throughout major cities like Miami and Orlando.

"We've never seen anything quite this bad before," said Chief Fire Officer Michael Anderson from the Miami-Dade County fire department who was among hundreds of emergency personnel working tirelessly through Friday night to rescue trapped individuals amidst submerged cars, homes, bridges, and roadways. "The extent of damage is absolutely heartbreaking."

This historic weather event has left at least 20 counties under states of disaster declaration with more than three million residents impacted directly or indirectly by the storm's aftermath so far today (March 16). The National Guard was mobilized across these hardest-hit areas to assist overwhelmed local authorities, while a growing list of national and international aid organizations have pledged support.

A representative from FEMA stated on Sunday that they are closely monitoring the situation in Florida as well its neighboring states which also experienced heavy rains and flooding; however he added there would be no immediate federal disaster declaration at this time due to insufficient deaths or damages reported so far: "We're prepared for anything," said Representative John Carter.

As of today, emergency personnel continue rescuing survivors trapped in the wreckage while assessing damage done across more than 10 cities and towns spread throughout Florida; some estimates put figures from insurance companies as high up to $5 billion according to officials working on post-storm reports.

Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Director Dr. Diana Farrington has been leading efforts in organizing a relief operation but admitted the situation remains "uncertain" with weather forecasts predicting further storms before major repairs could begin: "We're doing everything we can to help our fellow citizens get back on their feet," she said during yesterday's press conference.

The Florida Department of Transportation is currently focused mainly on clearing flooded roads and bridges as they work around-the-clock towards reopening vital transport links for evacuating affected residents; while the governor announced new state funds to aid in disaster recovery efforts with more money expected from insurance claims.

In Miami, where some of the hardest-hit areas are located - including Coral Gables and Coconut Grove neighborhoods – local officials have already begun planning extensive reconstruction projects; however residents like 62-year-old Maria Gonzalez remain distressed about her home's future: "We lost everything," she shared during an emotional interview yesterday.

Meanwhile, across the state line in Georgia which also faced heavy rain fall causing flash flooding - Governor Nathan Dean has declared a local disaster emergency for counties including Chatham County where Atlanta is located; however no fatalities have been reported so far as of today (March 17).

Gov. Carter was quoted saying "We're taking every precautionary measure necessary to ensure Floridians are safe and recover swiftly from this natural disaster."
