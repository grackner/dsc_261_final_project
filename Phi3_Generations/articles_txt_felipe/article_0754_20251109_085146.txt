In a groundbrein report that has caught global attention, the UK government announced plans today to phase out all petrol and diesel cars by 2035 as part of its efforts to combat climate change and reduce carbon emissions. The ambitious target is backed up with significant financial incentives for individuals and companies willing to switch to electric vehicles (EVs). This bold step comes amid growing concerns over the effects of global warming, particularly after a summer that saw record-breaking temperatures across Europe.

The announcement was made by Environment Secretary Therese Coffey during her keynote speech at an international sustainability summit in Edinburgh on Wednesday morning (September 15th). The event brought together world leaders, climate scientists, environmental activists and industry experts to discuss global strategies for combating the effects of a warming planet.

"Our future is electric," Coffey said, her words echoing throughout the halls as she looked out at an audience brimming with anticipation and curiosity. "We are committing ourselves not only to phasing out petrol and diesel cars by 2035 but also in providing a supportive framework for their citizens during this transition."

The UK government will provide grants of up to £7,000 per electric vehicle purchased through the Plug-in Grant scheme. Additionally, they are extending income tax exemptions on EVs and committing millions towards increasing charging infrastructure throughout British towns and cities across every region in the country by 2030 – a major step toward making sustainable transportation accessible to everyone.

Environmentalists worldwide have lauded this announcement, praising it as an essential move forward for humanity's survival on Earth amid unprecedented environmental challenges. Climate change expert Dr. Emma Thompson said in a statement earlier today: "We cannot afford further delays when the window of opportunity to limit climate disruption is so narrow."

However, not everyone has been receptive – with concerns about cost and availability surfacing among skeptics who worry that EVs may be too expensive for average consumers. Some question whether battery technology will improve sufficiently by 2035's end to make the initiative viable on a large scale, but government officials are confident in their plans: "We have seen significant advancements already," said Business Minister Lord Blankley during an interview today with Sky News Channel.

Several other countries – including France and Norway - had previously implemented similar policies for EV adoption as part of a global push towards decarbonizing the automotive sector, but many felt that these efforts lacked ambition in comparison to Britain's new target date. 

Reactions among industry analysts were mixed – with some predicting an eventual shift away from fossil fuels for transportation worldwide while others warned of potential economic disruptions as the UK transitions its infrastructure and workforce towards electric vehicles by mid-2035. One leading economist at Cambridge University, Professor Michael Clarke remarked: "The automotive industry has always been an engine driving forward technology innovations – we need to be prepared for this inevitable shift now."

Next steps are already being laid out as the UK government begins a nationwide campaign today aimed not only at raising awareness but also facilitating accessibility of EVs. They will launch financial aid programs targeting lower-in
