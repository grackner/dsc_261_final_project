An up-and-coming director from Los Angeles has just released their debut film which critics are praising as a groundbreaking take on science fiction cinema: "Galactic Frontiers" is the title of what's set to be an annual festival feature at this year’s Sundance Film Festival. The movie, with its bold narrative and visual effects that rival big-budget films has caught eyes all across Hollywood since opening last weekend where it garnered over $150,000 in sales alone from the New York City area before making a splash on digital streaming platforms this past Monday.

"Galactic Frontiers is unlike any other science fiction movie I've seen," said film critic Jamie Roberts after attending its screening at Sundance Film Festival last weekend, "It explores themes of identity and connection in ways that are deeply moving." Director Alex Johnson had to pull out due to scheduling conflicts with the festival but his collaborator Sam Parker will step up as a guest director for select scenes during next year's event.

"I believe this is just the beginning," said an excited Parker when asked about their take on continuing where Johnson left off, "Without him here right now there’s still plenty of room to expand and explore deeper themes in future instalments." The film stars several actors from independent films including recent Sundance winners Sophie Turner (“Lost Children”) and Chris Evans Jr. ("New Horizons"), alongside emerging talents like rising star Rachel Kim, as well an array of accomplished supporting roles by seasoned veterans such as Peter Dinklage who plays a pivotal role in the movie’s political backdrop.

The screenplay was co-written over five years ago between Johnson and Evans Jr., inspired by their shared interest in exploring unconventional narratives set within science fiction universes, with "Galactic Frontiers" being just one of many projects under development through the independent studio they run together - Starlight Pictures. 

The movie has already spawned a cult following on social media since its digital release this past Monday and fans are eagerly awaiting any news about what's next from Johnson, Parker or their production team at Studio Lightscape based in Los Angeles which will likely be announced during upcoming indie film conferences.
