A rare meteorological phenomenon brought unexpected hail to downtneria yesterday during what was forecasted as a sunny day. The National Weather Service had predicted clear skies and mild temperatures throughout the weekend, but at approximately noon on Saturday, several residents reported hearing loud crashes followed by iceballs raining down from above—the kind of hailstones that measure over two inches in diameter, according to reports gathered from witnesses. The weather anomaly occurred around 12:45 PM local time with the largest chunks lasting for a mere three minutes before they melted into tiny ice droplets carried away by warm air currents moving out of town towards neighboring cities like springfield and newhaven. Local meteorologists at downtneria University couldn't immediately explain how such extreme cold had managed to reach the typically temperate region, but speculated that a sudden drop in sea surface temperature could have played an unprecedented role. "We know these things are possible on rare occasions," says Dr. Emily Tran, Professor of Atmospheric Sciences at downtneria University, adding, 'but it’s highly unusual for such large hailstones to form under the given conditions.' The Downtnerian Agricultural Department has since been examining crop damage reports from multiple farms within a 20-mile radius. "Hail of this magnitude is not something we see on our doorstep very often," says downtnyrian farm owner Joe Martin, who reported significant losses to his crops in addition to shattered windows and minor injuries sustained by three employees at the time hail struck. Local emergency services were dispatched immediately following reports of potential injury from falling glass chunks but fortunately no one was harmed despite property damage that's estimated conservatively to be over $50,000 in downttown alone so far this Saturday afternoon. As researchers continue studying the incident, residents across multiple communities have been left reeling and recalling exactly how quickly weather can change—a chilling reminder of nature’s unpredictable might as they recover from an extraordinary day that will be talked about for months to come.
