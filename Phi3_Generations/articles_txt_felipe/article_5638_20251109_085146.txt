In a remarkable display of artistic talent and dedication, local New York artist Emily Carter has captured hearts with her latest mixed media installation at MoMA PS1's outdoor Summer Exhibition on June 5th through August 30th this year in Queens. As the summer sun shines down upon the sculptures created by a diverse group of artists representing various cultures and mediums, Carter's thought-provoking piece stands as an homage to traditional art forms amidst modernity.


Emily Carter says her inspiration came from observing how nature evolves seasonally: "I wanted my work to reflect the everlasting cycle of change." Her installation invites viewers into a dreamlike space where materials such as found objects, paint, and fabric blend seamlessly with natural elements like driftwood. Visitors are often seen deeply immersed in Carter's world for hours on end, contemplating her artistry that pays tribute to the styles of classic painters alongside contemporary eco-conscious aesthetics.


The striking sculptures have attracted attention from notable figures within and beyond the arts community—including Mayor Bill de Blasio who praised Carter's work for its "innovative approach" at MoMA PS1 last week during an opening reception that drew approximately 30,00throng of art enthusiasts. As many continue to engage with her installation over the next few weeks as it remains on display until August ends.


Public reaction has been largely positive with some experts saying Carter's work will likely inspire discussions about environmental themes in relation to art and society: "Her vision challenges us, not only visually but intellectually," stated Art Critic Jonathan Hayes during an interview on June 10th.

As visitors await the conclusion of MoMA PS1’s exhibition, there's already anticipation for Emily Carter's next creative venture where she plans to explore further artistic fusions while staying rooted in her deep respect for environmental stewardship and cultural narratives—a journey that has just begun.
