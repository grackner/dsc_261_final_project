In a stunning turn of events this afternoon at London's Heathrow Airport on April 5th, four passengers were discovered missing amidst heavy snowfall that has disrupted flights across the United Kingdom for days now. Airline staff found these individuals hiding in cargo holds as they attempted to avoid cancellations and delays caused by Winter Storm Zara. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) launched an investigation into this incident, which occurred just before noon when security reported abnormal temperature readings from the aircraft's hold compartments where non-authorized individuals were located without detection due to technical issues with monitoring equipment and staff shortage during rush hour.

"I was passing through terminal 5 around lunchtime yesterday when I saw one of these guys in there," a witness, Mark Daniels said as he shared his experience from the airport security office. "It just struck me how desperate people were." The four passengers are believed to have entered Heathrow's cargo holds using an unautsoftensided keycard provided by unverified sources on social media promising shelter and refuge during chaotic weather disruptions in London; the NTSB is investigating if there was any misconduct. 

"We take incidents like this very seriously," said a statement from Heathrow Airport spokeswoman, Sarah Thompson. "Our priority now is to ensure our passengers' safety and security while working alongside partner agencies on these complex matters." The Transportation Department released numbers showing that over the past week in London alone there have been more than 20 incidents of unauthorized access at airports due to weather-related issues, an increase from previous years.

This is a developing story and CNN will continue monitoring it closely for any further information or clarifications provided by relevant authorities regarding this alarming discovery in the UK's busiest international travel hub during one of its most severe winter storm seasons since 2010.
