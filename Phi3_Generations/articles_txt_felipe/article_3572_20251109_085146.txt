CNN – The world of Hollywood will witness a historic collaboration between actors Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt on their next big project set in New York City starting this fall. "This partnership is something the industry has been anticipating for years, promising not only star power but also groundbreaking cinematic experiences," says film critic Sarah Goldman of Hollywood Reporter magazine as excitement buzzes through fan communities and social media platforms alike across Los Angeles and beyond on Tuesday.

"It's an opportunity to bring the magic we create together into one project that could potentially redefine classic American cinema while celebrating some much-loved legends of Hollywood," says production chief Daniel Reed, who has been working with DiCaprio for years now including their Oscar-winning 'The Aviator'.

Brad Pitt first became part of a movie crew on Broadway in 1986 before taking center stage as the charming and handsome Tyler Durden opposite Brad (Jon Hamm), played by Tim Curry, at age just sixteen. Born into one Hollywood celebrity family after another – his parents Lesley-Anne and Don Halicki both were actresses themselves– it seemed like Pitt would always have access to the world of entertainment as he grew up in California's Beverly Hills neighborhood with a younger sister, Jennifer Ann (who also pursued an acting career).

The two met while shooting 'Three Reels,' DiCaprio and Pitt being cast together on screen for only their second film experience ever. The pairing of these leading men who were already in the pantheon of Hollywood A-listers created a unique bond that continues to intrigue many fans today, including those involved with this project: "Working alongside Brad was an incredible and unforgettable opportunity," reminisces DiCaprio.

Pitt says his career had not yet soared skyward as he became part of the film set in 1986 when their friendship began to blossom on screen, off-camera: "Our time together was genuine fun and it led us down some incredible paths," adds Pitt. Though both men took separate turns at fame's center stage with DiCaprio notably winning Best Actor for his role in 'The Revenant,' the camaraderie between him, Bradford (their shared given name) Pitt), remains strong and is poised to make this film something special."

As they begin pre-production next month at Universal Studios backlot recreation of iconic New York City landmarks such as Grand Central Station in Manhattan's East Village district — where DiCaprio spent time during his teenage years, the anticipation for what lies ahead continues to build: "With this collaboration comes not just our hopes and dreams but also a chance at making something memorable. We are excited about bringing these legends together once more in front of one another," says Reed amidst countless fan reactions already pouring into social media platforms nationwide as they eagerly await the news release date later this summer when audiences can finally be among them again."
