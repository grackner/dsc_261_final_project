Breaking space news: Scientists Discover a Hidden Planet in Our Solar System Beyond Neptune's Kuiper Belt - A New Frontier to Explore (Update)
(UPDATED) Space researchers from NASA and ESA have announced the groundbreenzing of an object they’ve identified as Dysnomia, a moon that appears companionate with far-flung dwarf planet known only by myth for over five decades. The discovery was made using data gathered during recent close flybys around Pluto conducted by NASA's New Horizons spacecraft in July 2015 and its continued observations of distant Kuiper Belt Objects (KBO) from Earth-based telescopes, respectively.

Dr. Alice Thompson is the lead researcher on this team at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena, California: "We're thrilled to announce that we have found a hidden world in our solar system - Dysnomia!" she said during today's press conference hosted by JPL. The celestial body was first identified as an object of interest based on its gravitational influence around the KBO known only by myth, which is now confirmed to be Orpheus (2017 VG/19).

Orpheus has never been directly observed or studied in detail due to its extreme distance from Earth and faintness. The identification marks a significant milestone for planetary science as it reveals the existence of yet another body within our solar system, which will undoubtedly add more depth to scientific understanding about formation processes at play billions years ago when sun-orbiting gas giants might have been forming in an era long gone by. 

"It's not every day that we find something new this close," said Dr. Thompson as she displayed images and simulations of the newly discovered moonlet on giant screens before JPL scientists, space agency representatives from other countries including ESA (European Space Agency), along with astronomers here on Earth who were invited to observe real-time imaging transmissions back home by NASA’s New Horizons probe. "We know that the planet host is a dwarf one - something which would make sense given its location in our solar system, but details about size and composition remain unclear at this moment."

Dr. Maria Rodriguez from ESA said during today's briefing: “Finding Dysnomia will surely have significant implications for understanding orbital mechanics within the outer reaches of Earth’s neighborhood.” The orbit characteristics could even shed light upon why certain celestial objects, like comets and asteroids with orbits that cross those inhabiting Pluto's own zone but don't seem to interact despite close encounters.

NASA scientists plan additional observations using ground-based telescopes over the coming months before they embark on an in-depth study of Orpheus itself, which will most likely include a dedicated spacecraft exploration mission once more funding becomes available from Congress or international partnerships such as ESA's involvement.

"It’s incredible to think that there might be entire worlds out here just waiting for us," said Dr. Thompson after the press conference concluded, smiling proudly at her team who have been eager and hardworking astronomers dedicated through thick and thin in their relentless quest towards uncovering
