Topic: Style - Beauty

In a dazzling display of style and beauty in the art world this weekend at Paris Fashion Week, designer Gabrielle Leroi unveiled her latest runway collection titled "Ethereal Allure." The fashion event took place on Friday evening (April 21) at Grand Palais de Paris.


"The concept behind 'Ethereal Allure' was to celebrate the delicate balance between femininity and strength," said Gabrielle Leroi, whose designs have consistently captivated fashion enthusiast endorsers across Europe. "I wanted a collection that would redefine beauty standards for contemporary women."


Loroi drew inspiration from various elements of nature—a reflection on the world we live in and our place within it. Her pieces are characterized by flowing silhouettes, earthy tones mixed with unexpected pops of iridescent colors that reflect sunlight beautifully under stage lights. The collection has been hailed as a return to classic elegance molded into modern form—where the essence is not just in what you see on the runway but also within yourself when wearing these transformative outfits, says fashion critic Jean-Luc Dubois.


As attendees gathered last night for an exclusive preview, many expressed their anticipation: "I've been waiting for a collection like this one because it shows what true artistry looks like," remarked Elise Mercier, 34, who has worked in the fashion industry since her early twenties.


Loroi plans to launch 'Ethereal Allure' globally next month and hopes that by doing so she can inspire more women around the world through their personal style choices as well as on a broader societal level: "Beauty is not just skin deep, it goes beyond appearance," Loroi emphasized.


The response from critics has been largely positive thus far with some expressing concerns about sustainability in fashion and how new collections impact the industry's carbon footprint; however, Gabrielle assures that all pieces are made using eco-friendly materials sourced responsibly: "Our planet is as much a muse to me as I am of it," Loroi shared.


Next steps for 'Ethereal Allure' will include worldwide fashion shows, with additional previews in Milan and New York scheduled before the official launch on May 20th when retailers can expect their share of Gabrielle's transformative designs—an embodiment of style meeting beauty.
