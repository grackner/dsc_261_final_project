A fire broke out at a maternity ward in London yesterday evening around 7:0 endicampbell and severely damaged property before being brought under control by emergency services within the next hour. No injuries were reported among staff or patients, according to reports from Metropolitan Police Service (MPS). The fire erupted at St. Mary's Hospital in East London during a time when it was bustling with newborn infants and their families attending routine check-ups. 

Firefighters worked tirelessly throughout the night, battling flames that quickly spread through mattresses, linens, medical equipment, and furniture as they tried to save St. Mary's Hospital for future generations of mothers in London. It took nearly three hours before fire crews were able to gain control over an inferno which initially began around 6:30 PM at the ward located on a busy East London thoroughfare known for its bustling nightlife and cultural events, according to witnesses speaking with The Guardian newspaper yesterday morning.

"I was just there because my sister had given birth earlier that day," says Mrs. Thompson (not her real name), who watched as firemen struggled against flames near where she stood in the hospital waiting room at about 9:30 PM last night when sirens could be heard blaring throughout East London for blocks around St Mary's Hospital and other emergency services responding to numerous calls across Greater London.

Dr Amit Patel, a local obstetrician-gynecologist working in the maternity ward at Saint Mary’s during his 12th hour shift yesterday evening described how he was evacuated from his workplace as staff prepared for possible water damage to patient rooms while smoke filled much of St.Mary's Hospital after firefighters arrived shortly before seven PM local time, reports the London Evening Standard newspaper today:

"I had just returned back into my clinic room when I heard a loud noise above me - sirens outside our hospital building and alarms inside as well that signaled for an evacuation," says Dr Patel. "It was chaotic but everyone knew exactly what to do." 

As the fire raged on throughout yesterday night, with some crews working through last call before returning home exhausted after hours of battling flames in and around St Mary’s Hospital - Chief Fire Officer Sarah Johnson has been praised for her quick decision-making when she noticed smoke coming from under a door near where patients were staying at about 7:15 PM. "I immediately ordered my crew to evacuate everyone," says the officer speaking with The Guardian newspaper today after receiving commendations yesterday afternoon by fire chiefs across London in appreciation for her actions during an already challenging evening involving multiple emergency incidents within Greater London last night including a gas leak near Kings Cross Station that caused mass road closures between 6:45 PM and almost midnight, reports BBC News online today. "It was my priority to make sure no one got hurt," says Chief Fire Officer Johnson after ensuring patient safety in the maternity ward before proceeding outward from St Mary's Hospital where other fire services joined efforts that evening as crews worked together tirelessly throughout yesterday night trying not only put this blaze under control, but also work through several calls for help across Greater London.

"The evacuation of patients and staff were completed within 15 minutes," says Chief Fire
