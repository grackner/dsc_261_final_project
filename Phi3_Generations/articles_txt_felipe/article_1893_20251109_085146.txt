A massive fire engulfed a six-story residential building in London yesterday afternoon around 3 pm local time. The East End Tower on Waterloo Road became uninhabitable as the blaze rapidly spread through multiple floors, destroying at least two apartments and causing partial collapse of three others. Firefigdependent services struggled to contain flames that broke out early in a routine inspection by London's fire department around 1 pm before reaching critical stages.

At present, all residents have been evacuated safely; however, the extent of damage is still unclear as investigations are ongoing. The East End Tower was last renovated five years ago and housed over three hundred families in a densely populated area just outside central London's financial district. 42-year-old resident Sarah Thompson recounted her terrifying experience, saying: "I heard the loud bang that signaled something had gone horribly wrong while I was upstairs doing laundry."

"There were no immediate signs of fire when we arrived for our inspection. We are shocked and saddened by what has transpired," said Chief Inspector James Walker from the London Fire Brigade, who is leading a team investigating this unprecedented incident in years past where fires have broken out rarely due to stringent safety regulations implemented after several tragedies over two decades ago. 

A local council official commented on Wednesday that they would ensure swift action against any structural damage, and re-housing of displaced residents will be a priority for the coming week as London braces itself to recover from this disaster.

The United Kingdom Prime Minister is set to address these concerns and visit affected families on Friday, promising his government would provide any necessary support required during this time of recovery. 

As the situation unfolds today with no end yet determined for those impacted by yesterday’s devastating fire at East End Tower in London, citizens across all boroughs are anxiously awaiting updates from authorities and demonstrations their solidarity within these trying times remain unwavering throughout this ordeal.

His family is among several hundred families being temporarily housed by friends or relatives nearby as they wait for temporary accommodation while investigations continue into the cause that allowed such a tragedy to occur in present day London.
