In a stunning turn of events at Wednesday night's championship game in New Orleans, Louisiana, point guard Anthony Thompson was ejected following an altercation with opposing team star John Harris. The incident occurred late into the fourth quarter when tensions boiled over on both sides after heated exchanges between players earlier that day still seemed to linger during playtime.

Anthony, whose aggressive style has been a key part of his playing arsenal for years at NBA level, found himself in hot water as referees decided to swarm him towards the free-throw line after he allegedly threw punches while on the court. "I didn't expect this," Anthony said through gritted teeth during an impromptu press conference postgame with a team representative present by his side, adding that despite being upset about how things turned out tonight, he never intended to hurt anyone and apologized for any misunderstanding.

"It appears as though the altercation started in pre-game warmup sessions yesterday when Anthony had words with John," explained an official who wished to remain anonymous due to fears of backlash within both teams' camps according a local insider, adding that animosity seems rooted deep beyond what happened on court tonight.

The ejection has sparked outrage from fans as well including many young basketball enthusiasts across the city who felt deeply invested in Anthony’s performance this season and now faced disappointment over his sudden departure mid-game - with online discussions popping up about potential changes to NBA policies surrounding player behavior both on court and off.

Some experts are weighing into whether or not such confrontations should lead to ejections, even in the heat of passion which seems common during playoff seasons where emotions run high for players who have fought before - especially when a career-defining game hangs over them like tonight's championship final.

"While I understand that tensions can get lost on court sometimes," said seasoned former player and current sports psychologist Robert Lee, "I believe it sets an example we don’t want our kids to replicate growing up seeing their heroes lose control instead of channeling anger into positive play." He added: “It's important that Anthony takes this as a wake-up call for better sportsmanship in the future.”

The team which lost faces an uphill battle ahead against formidable opponent Lakers, now playing with ten men. Coach Williams addressed reporters after today’s defeat and vowed his squad will pick themselves up strongly without Anthony - stating they are just as competitive when a key player is not there to complicate things on court: “The guys have worked hard all season despite challenges we've faced together," said the veteran coach who has been with Lakers for almost 20 years, adding his hope that team members from both camps continue open dialogue about creating safer environments within sports settings.

As Anthony and John are expected to sit out of tonight’s rematch scheduled tomorrow evening - fans across city anxiously await how it might unfold as the teams battle for their respective hopes without these two players at center stage – hoping that better communication on court will prevent similar incidents from ever happening again.
