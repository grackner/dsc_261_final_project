After a devastating train accident in Amman last Thursday evening, officials have released new safety measures to prevent similar incidents from occurring again. The crash on the outskirts of the capital injured dozens and resulted in significant damage to infrastructure along the line used by Jordanian Railways (JR). 

The incident occurred at approximately 7:30 PM local time when a freight train derailed near Azraq, located about an hour outside Amman. The National Transport Authority is investigating what caused this rare event after years of consistent safety records in the industry within Jordan and region-wide improvements following international standards set by global regulatory bodies like the International Union of Railways (UIR).

"We are taking immediate steps to enhance our rail safety protocols," said Minister Hassan al Majali. "Our team is working around the clock, along with experts from UIR and local engineering firms." 

According to witnesses who live close to where the accident took place near Al-Maghtas station just outside Amman's Azraq International Airport, a loud bang echoed through their neighborhood before seeing flames engulfing parts of both freight cars. One resident said they saw "an enormous cloud" rising into skies as emergency vehicles swarmed the scene and authorities tried to restore order amidst fear among local residents about potential recurrence on busy commuting routes that connect Amman's bustling city center with suburban villages across Jordan, where trains are often used for daily transport.

Jordanian Railways has faced criticism in recent years over maintenance issues and slow response times to reported problems along some lines - an issue which authorities claim is being addressed as part of the immediate safety improvements launched after this accident. In a statement issued last night by JR, CEO Abdullah Sulaiman announced plans for mandatory weekly checks on all tracks, increased use of automatic braking systems where manual ones are in place and enhanced training programs for operators to handle emergency scenarios better than before during their time with the company. 

The National Transport Authority is calling an urgent meeting today involving representatives from JR, UIR experts as well other relevant agencies such as Jordan's Civil Aviation Administration which monitors air and rail traffic flow across national borders - particularly around Amman international Airport where multiple modes of transport intersect in one small area. 

Reactions on social media have been mostly positive with many citizens showing their support for the swift actions taken by authorities, some tweeting that "it's time to prioritize safety over everything else." A Jordanian railway worker who prefers anonymity told The News Agency (TNA) he had experienced a number of close calls on his job during years working as operator and mechanic but said this was the worst call yet in terms both severity, impacted bystanders outside commuter routes.

"We have been through accidents before where people were only lightly injured; however nothing comes near to what happened yesterday," he told TNA with tears rolling down his cheeks as we spoke over phone line last Friday evening about the incident which rocked his community and country at large, affecting lives of friends in both Amman's bustling city center while impacting residents who live outside commuter routes.

A psychologist from a local university specializing in emergency trauma responded that she expected to see heightened cases of anxiety-related issues within the community where witnesses and those
