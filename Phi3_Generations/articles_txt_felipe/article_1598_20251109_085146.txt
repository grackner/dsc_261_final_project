In an unprecedented event that has left scientists and astronomers worldwide in awe, NASA'selinked mission to Mars successfully launched aboard SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy rocket from Florida on Tuesday at exactly 2:15 PM EST. The historic journey sets the stage for humanity to take its first step onto another planet since Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walked on the moon in 1969.

“This is a monumental moment not just for NASA, but for all of humankind,” said Dr. Maria Vasquez, chief engineer at Johnson Space Center during her exclusive interview with CNN after witnessing launch via live stream from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Control Room (CCAFC). “The possibilities and potentials are endless.”

Scientists believe that this mission represents the most advanced exploration of Mars to date, thanks largely in part because it carries life-detection experiments aimed at finding evidence for past or present microbial life on the Red Planet. The rover will also collect rock and soil samples which are intended to be retrieved by a future robotic mission back home on Earth.

Furthermore, with this launch taking place just months after an ambitious new study revealed that liquid water still flows underneath Mars’s south pole today; it is hoped the rover will shed light upon these mysteries of Martian weather patterns and geology — two fields crucial for understanding if life could ever survive on our planetary neighbor.

“The science we're doing here can change how people think about themselves, their place in space,” said Dr. Alan Cheng, Lead Scientist at Marshall Space Flight Center during his interview with The Daily Mail following Tuesday’s launch event where he had an opportunity to share insights into Mars exploration plans and challenges ahead for astronauts aboard the rover-laden vehicle bound towards Mars.

The ambitious $2.8 billion mission — a joint venture between NASA, SpaceX's Elon Musk personally managing company BFR division responsible here as well – was originally scheduled to launch in 2016 before delays caused by technical difficulties and budget issues put it back every other year until finally achieving lift-off after almost seven years of preparation.

Now, astronauts aboorbitingcraft have begun a months long journey towards Mars —and their arrival date has yet to be determined— as NASA works out an optimized course for landing during Martian southern spring equinox when temperatures should reach comfortable levels suitable both frozen ground and potential water sources on the planet's surface.

“It’s been years in planning, but I feel like we’re finally doing something that will change everything about space exploration,” said a visibly emotional Dr Maria Vasquez while gazing at live video footage of fiery ascent streaking towards outer space from Florida launch pad on Tuesday afternoon. “I just hope history records this moment correctly.”

With eyes worldwide fixed upon our red neighbor, humanity waits eagerly to see what secrets the dust-covered planet might unveil next – and perhaps one day even provide answers as profound yet elusive as asking whether we're alone in vast universe.
