As autumn leaves start to blanket New York City streets this weekend, renowned actress Emma Roberts made a grand appearance at her own star-studded birthday party on Friday night in Manhattan's upscinelike Chelsea Hotel. The evening was filled with the company of fellow celebrities and close friends from various walks of life; all gathered to celebrate 34 years old Roberts’ illustrious career while offering a glimpse into her personal world at this pivotal time in her journey towards motherhood.

Roberts, known for roles such as the lead character Mia Graham on "The Vampire Diaries," opened up about returning to work after giving birth and how that decision was made with complete ease knowing she had a reliable support system behind her: “It's always been my belief in myself. I knew if things didn’t go according to plan, it would be tough on me but also the little one we are hoping for.”
 
The party started at five o'clock and continued into late evening with guests enjoying live music from local jazz band ‘Sax & Soul,’ light chatter between friends sharing tales of their own experiences while working mothers, including Roberts. A special moment came when Roberts opened a gift from her long-time boyfriend Jon Hamm - an adorable baby onesie and matching hat for the soon to be new mommy: “It's perfect! So cute; I already have in mind which outfit she’ll wear,” joked Emma with cheeks flushed pink.
 
Her best friend from early days as ‘The Vampire Diaries’ cast, Ian Somerhalder spoke fondly about his close friendship and support for Roberts through thick and thin over the past decade-plus: “Emma has always been a strong woman who does whatever she sets her mind to. She is an incredible role model not just on screen but also off it.”
 
Roberts’ mother, actress Susan Davenport shared insight into how Roberts' family background helped mold the confident young lady we see today: “Emma always knew where she belonged and never hesitated in embracing her unique personality traits that make her who is. She has been so brave through every challenge life threw at her.”
 
In discussions about work-life balance, Roberts was candid with guests stating how grateful she feels for having a flexible role on the popular series “We Are Here to Stay”. The actress explains why returning after maternity leave doesn't faze her or affect relationships between cast members: "I feel like I have more flexibility as an actor and always try my best at maintaining harmony with the team, which makes things less challenging.”
 
CNN continues to cover this exciting milestone in Emma Roberts’ personal life. With many celebrities admitting that working after having children is difficult; however, it seems like she has found her rhythm and gracefully navigated through these changes while maintaining strong relationships with castmates from the hit TV series which ran for five seasons before ending its run last year: “I am happy to share this journey with my co-stars. I believe we all have learned valuable lessons about love, family life as well as our own self during filming,” she says proudly while recalling her time on set and expresses hope of returning for potential future seasons that might come through a streaming service: “It's something new to explore – it would definitely be great if fans could see us
