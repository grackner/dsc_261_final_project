A high-speed chase on Interstate 95 in Maryland last Thursday ended with a suspect believed to have committed armed robbery being apprehended by law enforcement near the Howard County border early Friday morning, reports CNN and DailyMail. The police reportedly followed an unmarked van belonging to a suspected felon who had allegedly stolen from multiple convenience stores in the area within the past month. After hours of pursuit involving numerous vehicles through densely populated suburban neighborhoods with heavy traffic congestion, Maryland State Police finally caught up and detained Christopher Walker at approximately 3:15am ET as he attempted to flee on foot near a rural section of Smithsburg in Washington County.

According to an official statement from the police department issued shortly after capture, Walker is suspected to have stolen more than $24,000 during his spree before being arrested for armed robbery at 7:30am ET on Friday morning near a convenience store in West Friendship. The announcement came as local law enforcement worked together with the FBI and National Guard after Walker's brazen crime left several frightened citizens across Howard County shaken up, reports CNN.

A witness to one of Walker’s crimes provided an account detailing his behavior while infiltrating a store at around 3:45am ET last Thursday night just as the community was still catching its breath from what seemed like endless hours without power due to Tropical Storm Fred, which hit earlier that week. “He came storming through with this scary expression on his face and looked all over me before snatching something off a shelf,” said 52-year old retail store employee Jodie Peterson from the front of her shop in West Friendship where Walker made his entrance, as per statements shared to DailyMail. “I thought I was going out for tonight’s show when he came running over – it felt like a nightmare.”

The Maryland State Police's special operations division led by Lt. Michael Burris applauded their success in bringing Walker down, despite the immense challenges posed due to traffic snarls and dense urban development along I-95: “It was an intense chase with a suspect who seemed intent on making it harder for us,” shared Lieutenant Burris during briefing hours before dawn. "But our hard work paid off as we brought the perpetrator under control without incident to his family members and neighbors."

Walker, 32-year old resident of Friendship Heights in Baltimore County has been identified by authorities through forensic evidence collected during arrest – fingerprints found on stolen items alongside video footage from local businesses. His brother, Michael Walker mentioned to reporters that he had little knowledge about Christopher's actions prior but would be cooperating with the investigation and hoping his sibling could return home safely soon after their detainment since they are first-degree relatives, per a statement shared via Maryland Division of Public Safety.

Crime expert Dr. Karen Johnson from Towson University’s Criminal Justice Institute commented that Walker's spree is indicative of underlying mental health issues and potential drug abuse while urging communities across the state to report suspicious activity without fear or hesitation, DailyMail reports further insights into this case will be shared soon via press conference with more details about his background.
