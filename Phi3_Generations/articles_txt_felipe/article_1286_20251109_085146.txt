A massive iceberg, measuring over 15 miles in length and almost twice as wide at its widest point, has broken off from the Thwaites Glacier on Antarctica's western edge near Pine Island Bay (PIB). The calving event took place during a time when temperatures were already rising due to climate change.

Experts believe that this particular iceberg poses no immediate threat as it is not drifting towards any inhabited areas or navigational routes, according to the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) which released a statement about the incident on Tuesday evening in London. However, they warn of potential risks if global warming continues unabated and more ice breakaway incidents occur at an alarming rate across several key glaciers around PIB.

Dr Katie Merrit from BAS said, "The calving event is not unexpected given the current state of our planet' endangered Thwaites Glacier due to climate change." The 7-mile wide and nearly a mile thick ice shelf had already experienced significant thinning over time as ocean currents carried warm water beneath it.

"Icebergs calving from Antarctica is natural, but the frequency of these events seems unusual," said Dr Merrit while emphasizing on urgent climate action needed globally to reduce carbon emissions that exacerbate polar temperatures beyond sustainable levels. 

Researchers have been closely monitoring Thwaites Glacier for signs of rapid melting and ice shelf retreat, which could lead to more water flowing into the ocean rather than remaining locked in glacial formations on land masses – a concern that has increasingly drawn attention among scientists worldwide. The last time such an event happened was during winter season from June 2019 till September of this year when two massive icebergs broke off simultaneously due to warmer atmospheric temperatures, and more than one million tons worth of glacial ice entered into the Southern Ocean daily as reported by WAIS Divide observatory.

In recent months, scientists have been observing an increase in calving events at Thwaites Glacier with some predicting that if warming trends continue unabated; it could lead to a runaway effect causing rapid ice shelf deterioration and even collapse of the entire glacial region within decades. The National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) noted in its latest report published this month about alarming increases observed across key glaciers around PIB, which if sustained could lead to significant sea level rise by century's end with dire consequences for coastal regions worldwide; especially low-lying islands and atolls.

Dr Peter Webb of the University College London remarked while discussing these events during a briefing in front of an international audience yesterday, "These recent findings highlight just how fragile our planet really is when faced with unchecked anthropogenic influence on climate systems." He urged governments across continents to reconsider their environmental policies and commit themselves towards sustainable development goals which prioritize protection against harmful effects of rapid global warming.

The British Antarctic Survey (BAS) has been collecting data for over two decades with its network spanning from Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, all around the continent and in remote regions like the Weddell Sea which is home to some of these major glaciers. Their findings have shown alarming tr
