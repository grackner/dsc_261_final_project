An explosion rocked a busy market in Baghdad last Thursday evening around 6:30 PM local time, injuring at least ten people and causing extensive damage to the central square's infrastructure. The incident occurred just days before an anticipated economic summit was set to attract international attention to Iraq’sempires efforts toward reconstruction in post-conflict zones of influence within their country.


The blast, which security footage from nearby streets appears not to be linked to any known terrorist groups operating on the region's radar so far, sent a wave of panic through Market Square - once one of Baghdad’s busiest hubs where locals and tourists alike have sought refuge in its lively atmosphere.


"People were just going about their day when all hell broke loose," recounted Hussain Saeid, a local shopkeeper whose establishment suffered considerable shattering of glasswork but remains mostly intact despite the traumatic encounter with chaos last weekend. "We heard an enormous noise and then felt tremors as though the ground was quaking beneath our feet."


Rescue teams were quick to respond, securing a safe haven within Market Square for those potentially affected by flying debris while first aid stations sprang up alongside police checkpoints established in response. At least six victims are currently hospitalized with varying degrees of serious injury and authorities maintain that there is no sign as yet any connection between the blast and wider threats to regional security amidst ongoing reconstruction efforts throughout Iraq, particularly within sensitive areas such as this one near central Baghdad's diplomatic district.


"The last thing we need right now with all these talks going on about rebuilding our economy is fear," stated Iman Farhad, a civilian whose family owns an adjacent food stall and has witnessed daily operations within the Square for over two decades since its heyday of prosperity. "This shock came out of nowhere."


Local officials continue to investigate with no official cause or suspect identified yet but emphasized that this unfortunate incident will not derail ongoing redevelopment projects aiming at revitalizing the central area which has long been associated both culturally and economically as a core asset within Iraq's fabric.
