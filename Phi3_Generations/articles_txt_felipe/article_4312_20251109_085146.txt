**A quaint French village revitalizes its culinary heritage with a unique festival celebrating traditional dishes and local wines.** The picturesque town of Château-Rhine is set to host the annual "Fête Gourmande et Vins du Rhône" starting this Saturday, inviting food enthusiasts from all over France as well as international visitors seeking authentic French culinary experiences since September 21st has been announced by village mayor Jean Dupont.

In an effort to reconnect with the area's rustic charm and rich viticulture history while boosting tourism, Château-Rhine will feature over twenty traditional chefs preparing regional delicacies alongside numerous wine tastings from local vineyards representing various Appellations Contrôlées.

Mayor Dupont expressed his joy about the festival'in ability to put their small town on the map: "We are honored by this recognition and excited for our community, as we proudly showcase what makes Château-Rhine unique in French cuisine," he said while pausing between sips of wine at a recent celebratory dinner.

The mayor continued to stress that authenticity is the key aspect they're focusing on: "We aim to deliver not just flavors but experiences, stories behind each dish and bottle for guests like you." The festival promises hands-on cooking workshops with master chefs as well as live music performances from local artists.

Local restaurateur Claire Boucher shared her feelings about the event: "The Fête Gourmande et Vins du Rhône is not just another gastronomy tourist trap but rather an intimate celebration of our culture and history." She added that she personally invites patrons to explore beyond their taste buds.

"French food isn't solely about the dishes themselves; it’s also a conversation with generations past, present times – all wrapped in a bite-size package," Boucher elucidated during an interview at her eponymous establishment on Main Street Château-Rhine.

Attendees will have access to guided food trails through the village’s old alleys leading up to family-owned vineyards where they can learn about traditional viticulture firsthand while savoring handcrafted cheeses from a local dairy farm, said Claire Boucher. A representative of one such winery was equally enthusiastic: "Our aim is not only for you to taste our wines but also understand the passion and dedication behind their creation," stated François Girard, head vintner at Château de la Belle Étoile Winery.

Château-Rhine's council has invested significantly in creating a comfortable ambiance with decor inspired by 17th-century French taverns that once bustled within the township. The festival will run from September 20th to October 3rd, allowing guests an opportunity to immerse themselves fully over three delightful days of culinary escapades and conviviality among like-minded food aficionados.

The village has already started promoting early bird tickets for the festival starting next month on their official website along with social media platforms as they anticipate a surge in tourism during these three weeks, which will be crucial to sustainably increase awareness and maintain local hospitality standards without causing permanent alterations.
