Australia: Massive bushfries threaten tourist season as experts forecast worst conditions in decades | CNN Business
A massive series of fires has engulfed vast stretches of Australia's east coast, raising fears for the nation's cherished summer holiday period. The escalating blazes that have scorched nearly 30% of New South Wales are now spreading towards popular tourist destinations in Queensland and Victoria as experts warn this could be one of the worst fire seasons on record, potentially disrupting millions in travel revenue for Qantas Airways.

Experts from Australia's Bureau of Meteorology predict that unusually dry conditions due to a persistent high-pressure system are likely responsible for an outbreak and continuation of bushfires across the eastern states since early September 2021, CNN reports. "We haven’t seen anything like this in decades," says Professor Michael Erenberg from Griffith University's School of Earth and Environmental Sciences who has studied fire ecology extensively over years spent researching bushfires across Australia and South America.

Agricultural losses are expected to be significant, with thousands impacted for the second year in a row after 2020's Black Summer devastated livelihoods from New South Wales through Victoria down into Tasmania as well -- though that is nowhere near on par with this summer. More than half of Queensland currently under threat prompting officials to declare states of emergency and even shutting down entire areas, including popular spots such as Fraser Island which has seen significant tourist activity in recent years.

Residents like Sarah Thompson (not her real name), whose family owns a vineyard just northwest of Melbourne have been forced out by the rapidly spreading fires -- some for months now since they began last August with no end in sight and only limited aid from emergency services as resources are stretched thin nationwide.
"It's hard seeing your land go up flames...but you see other families who lost their homes too," Thompson says, looking at the charred remains of her once-lush vineyard just before sunrise on a chilly November morning while waiting for evacuation helicopters.

The economic impact could prove devastating as well; with millions in tourism dollars likely lost due to closures and cancellations amid warnings that the worst may be yet to come ahead of Australia's bushfire season peaking next month during peak travel time towards Christmas holidays when thousands usually flock south for their annual beach breakdown.

Tourist operator Andrew Higgins from Surf 'n Sunnies Outfitters on Sydney Harbour says he already had to cancel several bookings this year alone because of the fires and expects many more cancellations as hotels, restaurants, bars shut down amid evacuation orders affecting thousands. "Our industry just took a massive hit...It’s going to be really tough," Higgins tells CNN Business while watching helicopters rescue stranded tourists in the area surrounding his beachside business that has been closed due an emergency warning as fires encroach towards Sydney's western suburb of Bondi.

Official government bodies like Tourism Australia have issued repeated statements reassuring Australians they can still enjoy their holidays while staying safe from bushfire-related hazards, though many experts doubt this will translate into real bookings amid travel
