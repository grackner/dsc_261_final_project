As Hurricane Ida barrelled towards New Orleans on Monday evening with wind speeds reaching up to a harrowing 140 miles per hour, residents are bracing for the impact of what forecasters say could be one of the strongest storms ever recorded in U.S. history by force alone. The category 4 cyclone is expected to make landfall late tonight or early tomorrow morning on Louisiana'in coastline and bring devastating floods, power outages, wind damage across parts of Florida as well.

Mayor Lantzy Youngblood has called it the "potential disaster" for New Orleans and issued mandatory evacuations from 7 p.m., urging everyone in low-lying areas to find immediate shelter elsewhere due to potential flooding exceeding up to six feet above ground level, according to a press release on Tuesday morning.

Residents have been advised by officials that they should seek higher ground as Ida is projected to bring heavy rainfall of between 15-20 inches within the next 72 hours - which could inundate much of New Orleans' historic neighbourhoods and submerge entire communities. The U.S National Weather Service warned that water levels are expected "to rise rapidly" with swift currents, causing potential life hazards on roadways during flash floods predicted to occur across Louisiana as well.

Emergency services have been mobilised in preparation for the hurricane's landfall and a state of emergency has already been declared by Governor John Bel Edwards yesterday evening after he toured damaged areas from previous storm surges, with mandatory evacuations enforced on barrier islands along Gulf Coast ahead of Ida. The Louisiana Department of Health released figures that nearly 200 people are currently in critical condition due to recent weather events and warned citizens not to return home until officials deem it safe as shelters fill up rapidly, with the last evacuee being transported from coastal towns yesterday afternoon into Baton Rouge.

"This is a matter of life or death for many people in Louisiana right now," said Edwards at his daily press conference today morning while standing alongside members of emergency services and state officials as they addressed concerns across the region, with some areas already reporting flood levels up to 12 feet along bayous. "I want every citizen here understand that when you evacuate under mandatory orders from your local authorities or law enforcement - we ask for full compliance in this matter."

A spokesp0spokeswoman at the Louisiana Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Services released a statement on Wednesday morning saying, "We are coordinating efforts with partners across state agencies to ensure that every individual who seeks shelter or assistance will have access during Hurricane Ida."

CNN reports thousands of citizens in surrounding states including Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas and Texas evacuated into shelters ahead of the storm's arrival. At least two deaths were reported from nearby areas with one victim tragically drowned while trying to escape flood waters on their property yesterday afternoon - as rescuers struggled through torrential downpours amid reports that flash floods had already begun in Louisiana, cutting off roadways and isolating entire communities.
