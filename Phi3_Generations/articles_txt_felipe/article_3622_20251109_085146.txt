A massive thunderstner storm is set to hit Chicago on Saturday evening, bringing with it potential for widespread power outages and severe weather conditions according to reports from the National Weather Service (NWS) in Romeoville, IL. The NWS warns that residents should brace themselves for possible downed trees, flooded streets, lightning strikes causing fires or electrical damage as a result of strong winds gusting up to 60 miles per hour by the time it passes through Chicago around 7:30 pm local time.

Meteorologist John Doe at WLS-TV said in an interview that "these kinds of storm events are not uncommon during this season, but what sets Saturday apart is its intensity." He continues to advise residents to stay indoors and avoid travel if possible as the city braces for impact. 

A spokesperson from ComEd reported around 100 utility workers have been dispatched across Chicago to help with any outages that may arise, while emergency services are on high alert in case of medical or rescue situations due to storm-related risks and damage throughout the city during this time. Emergency management officials say they expect multiple road closures as a result of fallen trees blocking major routes such as Lake Shore Drive within hours after sunset until midnight local time, while flash floods have also been predicted in low-lying areas prone to water accumulation due to storm surges and rainwater overflows.

Residents are being encouraged by the city officials to not hesitate before calling 911 if they find themselves stranded or need immediate assistance as a result of these adverse weather conditions, while local news networks advise viewers with elderly family members who may live alone in vulnerable areas such as apartments near waterfronts and basements prone to flooding to stay on top of the situation by keeping their TV tuned to 670 WGN-AM for regular updates from weather experts at Channel Seven.

In a statement yesterday, Mayor Lori Lightfoot said that "our city's infrastructure has been designed and built with resilience in mind, but as always during extreme events like this we need our residents to take precautions against damage or harm." She continues: 
"We are urging everyone across Chicago not only to have their emergency kits ready - including a flashlights, water bottles and non-perishable snacks stored away from potential flood waters in accessible places within your homes before the storm hits but also stay updated with our city's announcements via 911 or City of Chicago Twitter feed. We ask everyone to respect power outage warnings as well by refraining from unplugging any necessary medical equipment that may be essential during this time."

Local businesses and schools have begun taking precautionary measures such as cancelling events scheduled for Saturday, closing non-essential operations at their buildings or postponing work hours to accommodate potential power losses with the city providing resources including backup generators in case of emergency situations. Residents are encouraged by officials from WGN-AM and Channel Seven news networks alike as they prepare Chicagoans ahead for one of the most severe storms that could impact our great metropolis this season, calling on everyone to stay vigilant until it passes away around midnight when normalcy will hopefully return.
