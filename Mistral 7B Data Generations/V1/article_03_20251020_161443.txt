**ARTICLE:**

WASHINGTON, D.C., Mon June 07, 2021 — In a groundbreaking development, a team of researchers at the National Institute of Technology (NIT) has discovered a new species of bacteria with potential applications in the field of renewable energy. The bacteria, tentatively named Photosynthetica efficiens, has shown remarkable efficiency in converting sunlight into electrical energy.

The breakthrough was announced at a press conference by Dr. Jane Foster, the lead researcher on the project. "Photosynthetica efficiens has the ability to convert up to 40% of sunlight into usable energy, which is significantly higher than any other known bacteria," she said. This could potentially revolutionize the renewable energy sector, making solar power more affordable and accessible.

The discovery was made during a routine study of microorganisms found in soil samples collected from various parts of the world. The team noticed an unusual pattern in the growth and behavior of one particular strain of bacteria, which led them to investigate further. After several months of research, they were able to isolate the species and conduct comprehensive tests.

The NIT team has filed a patent for the bacteria and is currently working on developing a practical application for it. Dr. Foster explained that the next step is to create a biofilm using the bacteria, which can be used as a photovoltaic material. "We believe that within the next five years, we will have a viable product ready for commercial use," she said.

Meanwhile, the news has been met with enthusiasm by experts in the field. Dr. Michael Ross, a professor of renewable energy at MIT, praised the discovery: "If the NIT team can deliver on their promise, it could significantly reduce the cost of solar power and accelerate the transition to renewable energy."

However, some critics have raised concerns about the potential environmental impact of large-scale production of the bacteria. Dr. Lisa Johnson, a researcher at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), said, "While the benefits of this discovery are undeniable, we must ensure that the production and disposal of Photosynthetica efficiens do not harm the environment."

In response to these concerns, the NIT team has promised to conduct further studies and consult with environmental experts before moving forward with commercial production. They also emphasized that their primary goal is to find a sustainable solution for the energy crisis facing the world today.

The discovery of Photosynthetica efficiens marks an exciting new chapter in the quest for clean, renewable energy. As the team continues its research, the world watches with bated breath, hoping that this small, efficient bacteria will be the key to a brighter, greener future.

**HIGHLIGHTS:**
- Researchers at National Institute of Technology (NIT) discover new bacteria species called Photosynthetica efficiens.
- The bacteria converts up to 40% of sunlight into usable energy, potentially revolutionizing renewable energy.
- NIT team is developing a biofilm using the bacteria for commercial use within the next five years.
- Critics raise concerns about potential environmental impact of large-scale production; NIT promises further studies and consultations with experts.
