**ARTICLE:**

NEW YORK, Mon Feb 15, 2021 — In a groundbreaking development, researchers at the fictional XYZ Institute have successfully developed a new type of solar panel that promises to revolutionize renewable energy production. This innovative technology, dubbed "SolaraCell", could potentially solve the intermittency issues associated with traditional solar energy, making clean power more accessible and affordable for millions worldwide.

The SolaraCell, a result of eight years of research, is designed to capture and store solar energy during the night, thanks to its unique photovoltaic-thermoelectric hybrid system. This dual functionality allows the panel to generate electricity during both day and night, significantly increasing its efficiency compared to conventional panels.

"The SolaraCell is a game-changer," said Dr. Jane Thompson, lead researcher on the project. "We've managed to create a device that can harness and store solar energy continuously, making it a viable alternative to fossil fuels."

The storage component of the SolaraCell works by converting excess daytime energy into thermal energy, which is then stored in a high-density battery for use during the night. The panel also features a self-heating mechanism that ensures its efficiency remains high even at low temperatures.

The team at XYZ Institute claims that the SolaraCell can generate up to 25% more power than traditional solar panels under the same conditions, making it an attractive option for both residential and industrial applications. The panel is expected to be commercially available within the next three years, with costs comparable to existing solar technologies.

However, concerns have been raised about the potential environmental impact of the SolaraCell's manufacturing process. Dr. Thompson acknowledges these concerns but maintains that the institute is working diligently to minimize any negative impact.

"We understand the importance of sustainability, and we are taking every measure to ensure that the production of the SolaraCell has as little environmental footprint as possible," she said.

The development of the SolaraCell is being closely watched by energy experts and policymakers alike. If successful, it could mark a turning point in the global transition towards renewable energy, providing a scalable solution to the intermittency issues that have long plagued solar power.

**HIGHLIGHTS:**
- Researchers at XYZ Institute develop SolaraCell solar panel.
- SolaraCell captures and stores solar energy during the night.
- SolaraCell expected to be commercially available in three years.
- SolaraCell generates up to 25% more power than traditional solar panels.
- Concerns raised about potential environmental impact of manufacturing process.
