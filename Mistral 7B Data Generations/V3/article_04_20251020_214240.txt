**Title:** "Tesla Unveils Groundbreaking Solar Roof Tiles at Sustainable Energy Event"

**Full Article:**

In a groundbreaking move towards sustainable energy, Tesla Inc., led by CEO Elon Musk, unveiled its new solar roof tiles during the company's annual Sustainable Energy Event held in California. The innovative product promises to revolutionize the renewable energy market, combining aesthetics with efficiency in a way that could potentially make traditional roofing obsolete.

The solar roof tiles are designed to be visually indistinguishable from conventional roofing materials while harnessing solar power. They are expected to generate clean electricity for homes and businesses at a cost comparable to or less than fossil fuel-based energy sources over time.

Musk, known for his ambitious projects, described the solar roof tiles as the future of roofing. He emphasized that Tesla's latest invention is not just a rooftop solar panel but an integrated component of the building itself. The tiles are made with photovoltaic cells embedded in their structure, making them robust and durable.

Tesla aims to start mass production of these tiles in 2021, with plans to roll out the product in the United States, Europe, and Australia. The company also announced a financing option that allows customers to pay for their solar roof through savings on electricity bills over time.

The unveiling was met with widespread praise from environmentalists and energy experts alike, who see this as a significant step towards reducing carbon emissions and combating climate change. However, critics have raised concerns about the potential cost and complexity of installation compared to traditional roofing methods.
