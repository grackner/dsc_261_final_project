**DATELINE: NEW YORK, Mon, March 15, 2021**

U.S. health officials have warned of a potential surge in COVID-19 cases due to the rapid spread of the more contagious UK variant, as new data shows that the strain is now present in nearly half of all sequenced cases across the country.

"We're at a critical juncture," said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, during a Senate hearing on Tuesday. "The more we see the UK variant spreading, the greater the chance it could push us back into a precarious situation."

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the UK variant, also known as B.1.1.7, now accounts for 46% of all sequenced COVID-19 cases in the U.S. The CDC predicts that the variant could become the dominant strain in the country within a few months if current trends continue.

"The UK variant is concerning because it spreads more easily than the original virus," said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the CDC director. "We need to take this threat seriously and redouble our efforts to control the pandemic."

The warning comes as the U.S. continues its vaccination campaign, with over 100 million doses administered so far. However, the rapid spread of the UK variant has prompted calls for increased vigilance and caution.

"We need to be mindful of the fact that the virus is still circulating and that new variants are emerging," said Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a former FDA commissioner and current board member at Pfizer. "The vaccine is our way out of this pandemic, but we can't let our guard down."

State and local officials are scrambling to ramp up testing and contact tracing efforts in areas where the UK variant has been detected. In California, for example, health officials have reported a sharp increase in cases among younger people, who are more likely to spread the virus due to their social activities.

"We're seeing a lot of cases among people under 30," said Dr. Barbara Ferrer, the director of the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. "This is a reminder that we all need to do our part to stop the spread of COVID-19."

Context:
The U.S. has been battling COVID-19 for over a year now, with over 530,000 deaths reported so far. The rapid rollout of vaccines has given hope that the end of the pandemic is in sight, but health officials warn that the UK variant poses a significant threat to that progress.

HIGHLIGHTS:
- The UK COVID-19 variant now accounts for 46% of all sequenced cases in the U.S.
- The CDC predicts the UK variant could become the dominant strain within a few months.
- Dr. Anthony Fauci warns that the variant could push the country back into a precarious situation.
- State and local officials are ramping up testing and contact tracing efforts in response to the surge in cases.
- Dr. Barbara Ferrer reports a sharp increase in cases among younger people in California.
