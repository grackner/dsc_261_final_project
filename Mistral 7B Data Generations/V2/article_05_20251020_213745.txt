### MODEL OUTPUT ###
**Dateline: NEW YORK, Mon Feb 1, 2021**

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported a new variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in samples collected from travelers arriving at John F. Kennedy International Airport. The variant, known as B.1.526, was first detected in New York City last month.

The CDC, in a statement, confirmed that the variant has mutations similar to those found in the highly infectious UK and South African variants. However, further studies are needed to understand its transmissibility and potential impact on vaccine effectiveness.

"This is a reminder that the pandemic is far from over," said Dr. Anne Rimoin, an epidemiologist at the University of California, Los Angeles. "We need to continue following public health guidelines to slow the spread of all variants."

Officials at JFK have increased testing for arriving travelers and are urging them to self-quarantine upon arrival, regardless of their test results. "Our top priority is the health and safety of our passengers and staff," said a spokesperson for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

The CDC has also urged states to ramp up their surveillance for new variants and to ensure that adequate genomic sequencing capacity is in place.

**Context:**
The emergence of new variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has raised concerns worldwide, as some variants have shown increased transmissibility and potential resistance to vaccines. The B.1.526 variant was first detected in Denmark in October 2020 and has since been found in several countries, including the United States.

**HIGHLIGHTS:**
- A new variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, B.1.526, has been detected in samples from travelers arriving at JFK Airport.
- The CDC has confirmed that the variant shares mutations with the UK and South African variants.
- Further studies are needed to understand its transmissibility and potential impact on vaccine effectiveness.
- Officials at JFK have increased testing for arriving travelers and are urging self-quarantine.
- The CDC has urged states to ramp up their surveillance for new variants and ensure adequate genomic sequencing capacity.
