**DATELINE: Washington, DC, Mon, March 21, 2022**

The White House has confirmed a significant discovery made by NASA's Mars Perseverance rover. The robot has found signs of ancient microbial life on the Red Planet, according to a statement from NASA officials.

"We have made history today," said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson during a press conference. "The data sent back by Perseverance suggests that there was once life on Mars."

NASA scientists analyzed rock samples collected by the rover and found organic molecules, a key indicator of life. The samples were taken from an ancient river delta on Mars' Jezero Crater.

"These findings are incredibly exciting," said Dr. Jennifer Trosper, project scientist for the Mars 2020 Perseverance Rover mission. "We've long suspected that Mars may have had microbial life billions of years ago, and now we have evidence to support that theory."

However, the discovery does not mean that there is currently life on Mars. The organic molecules found could have been produced by non-living chemical reactions or could be remnants of ancient life.

The next step will be to study the samples further and search for more evidence of life on Mars. NASA has plans to send a sample return mission to Mars in the coming years, which could bring the Martian samples back to Earth for closer examination.

**HIGHLIGHTS:**

* NASA's Perseverance rover has found signs of ancient microbial life on Mars.
* The discovery was made through analysis of rock samples taken from an ancient river delta on Mars' Jezero Crater.
* The findings are exciting but do not necessarily mean that there is currently life on Mars.
* NASA plans to send a sample return mission to Mars in the coming years to study the samples further.
