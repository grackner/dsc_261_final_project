### MODEL OUTPUT ###
**Dateline: LONDON, Mon Feb 14, 2022**

The UK government has urged citizens to be vigilant after a cyber attack on one of the country's largest energy suppliers.

Officials at Centrica, the parent company of British Gas, confirmed the breach on Monday but declined to provide details about the nature or extent of the attack.

"We can confirm that we have experienced a cyber incident," a spokesperson for Centrica said. "We are taking this matter extremely seriously and working around the clock to understand the full scale of the issue."

The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), part of the UK's GCHQ intelligence agency, said it was monitoring the situation closely.

"We are aware of an incident affecting British Gas," an NCSC spokesperson said. "Our advisers are providing assistance and working closely with Centrica to understand the details."

British Gas supplies gas and electricity to millions of homes across the UK and any disruption could have a significant impact on households.

The company said it was taking steps to mitigate the impact of the attack, including temporarily shutting down some systems as a precaution.

"We are taking immediate steps to protect our customers' data and to minimize any disruption to our services," the Centrica spokesperson added.

It is not yet clear whether the attack was carried out by a state-sponsored group or a criminal organization, but experts have warned that such attacks are becoming increasingly common.

"Cyber attacks on critical infrastructure are a growing threat, and we've seen a number of high-profile incidents in recent years," said Dr. Jessica Barker, a cybersecurity expert and co-founder of Cygenta. "It's essential that organizations like Centrica take steps to protect themselves and their customers."

The UK government has set up a dedicated unit to respond to cyber attacks on critical infrastructure, and officials have urged all organizations to take steps to strengthen their defenses.

**HIGHLIGHTS:**

* British Gas, one of the UK's largest energy suppliers, has suffered a cyber attack.
* The National Cyber Security Centre is monitoring the situation.
* It is not yet clear who carried out the attack or the extent of the damage.
