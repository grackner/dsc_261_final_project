# DSC 261 Final Project
Directories:
1. Data Eval- Data evaluation directory contains all of the script to measure data quality metrics on synthetic and real data
2. Phi3_Generations- Directory contains the scripts to run inference on Phi model and synthetic datasets
3. Gemma- Directory contains code and generated datasets related to the Gemma model
4. Tinyllama- Directory contains code and generated datasets related to the Tinyllama model
5. Opt_finetuning- Code to initially finetune the Opt model. Additional scripts are hosted on Google Drive
6. Opt_inference- Code to generate outputs from the finetuned Opt model
7. Qwen folder contains code to run inference on Qwen and some sample outputs
8. synthetic_training_data- contains some of our synthetic training data but most is hosted on Google Drive (see below)

Misc files:
- Data cleaning notebook for preprocessing the CNN dataset
- Loss calculation script for calculating cross-entropy loss on each interation of our models
