              "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- CIA interrogators used waterboarding at least 266 times on two top al Qaeda suspects, according to a Bush-era Justice Department memo released by the Obama administration. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, seen in a December sketch, was waterboarded 183 times in a month, a memo says. The controversial technique that simulates drowning -- and which President Obama calls torture -- was used at least 83 times in August 2002 on suspected al Qaeda leader Abu Zubaydah, according to the memo. Interrogators also waterboarded Khalid Sheikh Mohammed 183 times in March 2003. Mohammed is believed to be the mastermind behind the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States. Obama released the memo Thursday, saying that \"exceptional circumstances surround these memos and require their release.\"  Watch other tactics outlined in memos » . The memo, dated May 30, 2005, was from then-Deputy Assistant Attorney General Steven G. Bradbury to John Rizzo, who was acting general counsel for the CIA. It paints a different picture from the one described by former CIA officer John Kiriakou. In a December 2007 interview with CNN, Kiriakou said Zubaydah had been waterboarded for \"about 30 seconds, 35 seconds\" and agreed to cooperate with interrogators the following day. In an interview on \"Fox News Sunday,\" Michael Hayden, who directed the CIA from 2006 to 2009, was asked about the number of times Mohammed was waterboarded. Hayden denounced the release of the memos and did not comment on the number, saying it was his understanding that the frequency of waterboarding was among the operational details that had not been declassified.  Watch one expert say tactics 'worse than Abu Ghraib' » . The 2005 memo refers to a letter that had contained the numbers as well. Part of the reference to the letter was redacted in the released memo. Waterboarding is among the interrogation tactics that Obama has prohibited through an executive order. The CIA also has admitted waterboarding Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, the first person charged in the United States for the 2000 attack on the USS Cole in Yemen that killed 17 U.S. sailors. Obama said last week he felt comfortable releasing the classified memos because the Bush administration acknowledged using some of the practices associated with the memos, and the interrogation techniques were widely reported and have since been banned. \"Withholding these memos would only serve to deny facts that have been in the public domain for some time,\" Obama said in a statement. \"This could contribute to an inaccurate accounting of the past, and fuel erroneous and inflammatory assumptions about actions taken by the United States.\" The president applauded the work of the U.S. intelligence community and said no one who \"carried out their duties relying in good faith upon legal advice from the Department of Justice\" would be prosecuted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         2\n",
              "(CNN) -- Basketball commentator and former hoops star Charles Barkley was arrested Wednesday in Scottsdale, Arizona, on suspicion of drunken driving, a police spokesman said. Charles Barkley was driving an Infiniti SUV through a trendy area of Scottsdale on Wednesday, police say. Barkley issued a brief statement, saying, \"I am disappointed that I put myself in that situation. The Scottsdale police were fantastic. I will not comment any further as it is a legal matter.\" Lt. Eric Shuhandler of the Gilbert Police Department said an officer pulled Barkley over after he ran a stop sign in Scottsdale's Old Town area, a trendy spot known for its nightclubs and bars. Gilbert and Scottsdale are in the Phoenix metro area. \"The officer identified the driver of the 2005 Infiniti as Charles Barkley,\" according to a written statement from police. \"Mr. Barkley was administered the standard field sobriety tests after the odor of intoxicating liquor was detected.\"  Watch: Barkley 'disappointed' by arrest » . At a news conference later in the day, Shuhandler said Barkley's \"performance on the field sobriety test revealed there was probable cause to make an arrest.\" Barkley declined to take a breath test to measure his blood-alcohol level, Shuhandler said earlier. \"When he arrived at the station, police administered a blood test, which is customary of our police department to do,\" he said, adding that Barkley consented to the blood test. It will take \"a few days\" for the crime lab to test the blood sample and determine Barkley's blood-alcohol level, Shuhandler said. The former NBA power forward was cited for driving while impaired and released. \"It was a pretty routine arrest,\" Shuhandler said. Barkley's sport-utility vehicle was impounded under mandatory vehicle impound laws, police said. Shuhandler said Barkley behaved professionally during the booking and was \"very respectful and cordial with our officers.\"  Watch Shuhandler describe the arrest » . Barkley, 45, is a commentator for TNT's coverage of the NBA. In October, he told CNN's Campbell Brown that he plans to run for governor of his home state of Alabama in 2014, saying, \"I can't screw up Alabama. We are number 48 in everything and Arkansas and Mississippi aren't going anywhere.\" Although he is well known for entertaining comments and a cocky attitude, he also compiled an impressive résumé as a professional basketball player. A Hall of Famer and 11-time All-Star, Barkley is one of four players in history to rack up more than 20,000 points, 10,000 rebounds and 4,000 assists in a career. He also earned the NBA's most valuable player designation in 1993 and brought home gold medals with the U.S. Olympic basketball team in 1992 and 1996. His commanding performance on the court earned him the nicknames \"Sir Charles\" and the \"Round Mound of Rebound.\" Barkley was drafted out of Auburn University in 1984 by the Philadelphia 76ers and played 16 seasons with the Sixers, Phoenix Suns and Houston Rockets before he was permanently sidelined in 1999 with a ruptured tendon in his left knee.

              "Paul Scholes believes Raheem Sterling and Jack Wilshere should follow the lead of Juan Mata and play in next summer's European Under 21 Championship, should England qualify. Gareth Southgate's Young Lions take on Croatia in the first leg of their play-off at Molineux on Friday night and head into the match in fine form having won nine of their 10 group games. But former England and Manchester United midfielder Scholes writes in his Independent column that there needs to be a culture change if England are to succeed at Under 21 level. Jack Wilshere - man of the match against San Marino - will be eligible to play for the Under 21s next summer . Liverpool attacker Raheem Sterling should also go the European Under 21 Championship, says Paul Scholes . 'There are too many young players who, having made a senior debut, see a move to the Under 21s as a demotion,' Scholes argues. 'Calum Chambers is a prime example. He went from the Under 19s to the senior team. Then he was in the Under 21s squad this week until the injury to John Stones meant that he returned to the seniors. 'I have no reason to doubt that Chambers would have taken the Under 21s seriously. But if any player needs a reminder, they only have to look as far as Juan Mata. He was part of the Spain squad that won the World Cup in 2010 in South Africa and then went back to the Under-21s the following summer and won the European Championship. Manchester United playmaker Juan Mata celebrates with the World Cup trophy in 2010 . Mata with his Bronze Boot award after helping Spain to the European Under 21 title in Denmark in 2011 . Scholes says that Calum Chambers (above) should not consider an Under 21s call-up a demotion . 'If it is good enough for Mata, why not English lads, too? Should Southgate’s team make it to the tournament, I would advocate taking Raheem Sterling and Jack Wilshere to the tournament next summer, even though they are well-established in the senior team.' Scholes highlights the counter-argument to his point; namely that dropping players who had played in qualifiers for those who haven't would be inherently unfair. But he retorts: 'Does the Football Association want to win something? If the answer is 'Yes', then it is time to be ruthless about getting the best team on the pitch.' Scholes played 66 times for England but never made an appearances for the Under 21s .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  2\n",
              "JERUSALEM (CNN) -- The world knows her as the daring nanny who, clutching a 2-year-old boy, pushed past the havoc in a terrorized Mumbai and risked her life to keep the toddler safe. Sandra Samuel bravely saved the life of Moshe Holtzberg, 2, but says she sees no heroism in her actions. But Sandra Samuel sees no heroism in her actions amid last week's terror attacks on India's financial capital that killed nearly 180 people -- including baby Moshe's parents, Rabbi Gavriel Holtzberg and his wife, Rivka. She only wishes she could have done more. \"Even today, I am thinking I should have sent the baby and done something for the rabbi and his wife,\" Samuel told CNN in an exclusive television interview in Israel, where she now lives. Samuel and Moshe were among the few to make it out of the Chabad House alive after gunmen stormed the Jewish center, killing the Holtzbergs and four others. Israel's Chabad movement has set up a fund to provide for Moshe's care. He is being looked after by members of the community, although who will serve as his guardian has not yet been established. The nanny says she came face to face with a gunman late Wednesday, the first night of the siege. \"I saw one man was shooting at me -- he shot at me.\"  Watch CNN's Paula Hancocks talk with Samuel » . She slammed a door and hid in a first-floor storage room and attempted to reach the rabbi and the others on the second floor. Overnight, Samuel frantically tried to call for help as gunfire and grenade blasts shook the Chabad House. Samuel says she emerged early the next afternoon, when she heard Moshe calling for her. She found the child crying as he stood between his parents, who she says appeared unconscious but still alive. Based on the marks on Moshe's back, she believes he was struck so hard by a gunman that he fell unconscious at some point as well. \"First thing is that a baby is very important for me and this baby is something very precious to me and that's what made me just not think anything -- just pick up the baby and run,\" Samuel said. \"When I hear gunshot, it's not one or 20. It's like a hundred gunshots,\" she added. \"Even I'm a mother of two children so I just pick up the baby and run. Does anyone think of dying at the moment when there's a small, precious baby?\"  Watch Samuel describe the escape » . Outside, chaos flooded the streets as people tried to make sense of the massacre that killed at least 179 people and wounded 300 others. Ultimately, she and Moshe reached safety at the home of an Israeli consul before arriving in Israel, where she is considered a hero. In the aftermath of the attacks, Moshe asked for his mother continuously, Samuel says, and he is learning to play again -- though he likes the nanny close by. And while she still has nightmares of the horrific siege that took hold of Mumbai, Samuel, a non-Jew and native of India, said she will stay in Israel for as long as Moshe needs her.  Watch as Samuel describes boy asking for his mother » . \"Yes, yes, they said it is important I am here,\" she said. \"Me, I just take care of the baby.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           2\n",

              "By . Emma Glanfield . British shoppers are paying more for gadgets, clothes and accessories than US shoppers because the pound is at a five-year high. Gadgets including the latest Apple iPad and Xbox One are more than £100 cheaper in America than Britain, while accessories are also far less expensive - including a Tiffany Harmony diamond and platinum engagement ring which costs £10,300 in England but only £7,477 in the US. The discounts are due to the current strength of the pound, which has hit $1.70 for the first time since 2009. The study by British Airways compared the price of dozens of products and found clothes, accessories and make-up to be far cheaper in the US than the UK. Gadgets including the Xbox One were also much cheaper . A study by British Airways compared the price of dozens of products and found clothes and make-up also to be far cheaper abroad. Ugg boots cost £60 less in the US, while some Victoria’s Secret items are up to £30 cheaper across the Atlantic. Nike ID trainers are also 41 per cent cheaper in the US than the UK. British Airways said the potential for huge savings made America the top destination this summer for British holidaymakers, with New York deemed the best for stocking up on goods. Claire Bentley, managing director of British Airways Holidays, said: ‘New York is one of the best places in the world to go shopping, especially now you can literally get more bang for your buck. ‘If you’re thrifty enough, the savings you can make could even pay for your trip.’ Many large US department stores are also known to offer further discounts in an attempt to attract international visitors, with Macy’s offering shoppers an additional ten per cent off. The findings come after it was revealed British shoppers are also paying as much as 60 per cent more for high street fashion brands than the rest of Europe. Retail figures revealed global chains including H&M, Zara and Mango hike up prices for their UK customers. New York is one of the top destinations for British shoppers looking for bargains, with many department stores offering further discounts to international visitors, with Macy's offering shoppers an additional ten per cent off . A snapshot survey of 20 items sold by major chains in 14 countries showed the UK to be more expensive than Spain, the US, Greece, Italy, Ireland and Poland. A Zara tunic dress on sale for £49.20 in Spain cost more than £20 more in the UK while t-shirts from the same store worked out to be more than double the price in Britain. Researchers for foreign currency firm Caxton FX found the average UK mark-up for items from the international stores was 18 per cent. The only country which was consistently more expensive than the UK was Switzerland. Global fashion chains typically claim their prices are higher in the UK because rent, rates, staff costs and taxes are higher. But analyst Neil Saunders, from retail consultancy Conlumino, said last month: ‘Retailers will look at each individual country to see what consumers are willing to pay. If they can charge more in the UK, they will.’                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           1\n",

The oil separation technology was developed in the 1990s by a company created by Costner, but Baldwin became involved while in New Orleans to produce a documentary about the Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico in May 2010. Video: Costner's plea to save the Gulf . Baldwin and Spyridon Contogouris decided to sell their stock soon after getting it because of differences with other shareholders, according to the lawsuit. They signed an agreement to sell their shares to Patrick Smith, who then transferred them to a company partly owned by Costner, on June 11, 2010. BP announced on June 15, 2010, it would lease 32 machines from the company. Lessons lingering from oil spill . If Smith and Costner had told them BP was placing a huge order, they would not have sold, the suit said. The 10% of the company that Baldwin sold for $500,000 should have been worth $3.8 million, while the 28% stake sold by Contogouris for $1.4 million was worth $10.6 million, the suit said. Lawyers for Costner and Smith contend Baldwin and Contogouris sold their stock \"with eyes wide open, to get out of a soured business relationship and to invest in other ventures.\" Video: Can Costner clean up the spill? They knew that BP might place the order, a defense filing said. It was widely reported in the news and Costner testified about it to Congress two days before the stock sale. Contrary to trying to trick Baldwin into selling his shares, Costner was \"dumbfounded,\" \"flabbergasted\" and \"furious\" when he learned Baldwin and Contogouris had sold out \"because it enabled plaintiffs to cash out their interests\" before the company had earned any money, the defense filing said. Costner and Baldwin are both on the list of witnesses expected to testify.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1\n",
              "True or false? Andrea Rossi, pictured, says he has built a machine achieving 'cold fusion'  but scientists question if it is possible . An Italian physicist claims he has managed to achieve 'cold fusion' - a procedure that could solve the world's energy crisis by creating huge amounts of safe nuclear energy without dangerous radiation. Andrea Rossi says his new machine fuses nickel and hydrogen at room temperature creating almost unlimited energy. But there is one problem - many scientists claim it defies the very laws of physics. Several high-profile demonstrations of 'cold fusion' have been proven to be hoaxes in the past - and no one can adequately explain how or why it might work. The United States Department of Energy the U.S. Patent Office say the process is impossible because physics rules out the possibility of room-temperature nuclear fusion. But Rossi's E-Cat machine can allegedly do it, and he says he proved it worked during tests at the University of Bologna last month. 'With low energy, it's possible to give a heater a certain amount of energy and to get from the same heater a superior amount of energy,' he said. 'The heat is initiated by electrical resistance. The reactors then produce another 479kWh of energy for another three to four hours without needing that initial electrical input -- the low-level nuclear reaction continues on its own. Machine: Professor Rossi's E-Cat was tested last month and produced huge amounts of non-radioactive energy, he says . Key: Rossi says he has produced a pattern of triple track atoms, pictured, which is at the heart of the cold fusion theory . 'The test we made by the customer was to see if the process was working properly, and to control whether the energy was in an amount superior to the amount supplied to the system. 'We have nothing to say, just to make plans that work properly and let those facts win against the scepticism.' The idea of cold fusion was put forward by in the 1920s by Austrian scientists Friedrich Paneth and Kurt Peters. But despite several people saying they have done it, it has been dismissed by most physicists. An atom is a nucleus of protons and neutrons, with electrons orbiting around . Scientists say that Rossi's claims must be taken from his lab and analysed before he can claim he has done it. Energy consultant Jonathan Koomey said '[The E-Cat experiment] should be treated as a hoax until independent scientists are able to replicate these results,' But Sterling Allan, CEO of the alternative energy news agency Pure Energy Systems, told FoxNews.com he attended Rossi’s demonstration and the E-Cat is self sustaining. 'What Rossi demonstrated was 470 kilowatts of continuous output in self-sustain mode -- meaning the output was enough to keep the thing running on its own,' he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     1\n",

When a male colleague playfully slapped her behind as she bent over a desk, care assistant Kelly Daley laughed it off as horseplay. Unfortunately, when she decided to take ‘playful’ revenge by confronting him in the care home laundry room and undoing buttons on his uniform, he didn’t see the funny side. The man reported Miss Daley, 29, to management for bullying and sexual harassment, claiming his dignity was ‘violated’, an employment tribunal was told. It was also claimed she grabbed his genitals – which she strongly denied. 'Just harmless fun': Care worker Kelly Daley (pictured) was sacked after she undid the top buttons of a male colleague's uniform as a joke while another worker filmed it . Miss Daley and fellow carer Gemma . Bartrop, 27, who filmed the button incident on her mobile phone, were . sacked for gross misconduct. A female nurse who viewed the footage was . also given a final written warning. However, the man, who had previously . slapped both their bottoms in similar incidents, escaped with a ticking . off. He was also granted the legal right to . anonymity after the Sheffield tribunal decided the incident should be . treated like a sexual offence. Miss Daley claimed unfair dismissal . against the owners of the privately-run home in Rotherham, South . Yorkshire, but lost her case. She had worked at the home for more than eight years and had a previously unblemished record. ‘I feel he has been treated far more leniently than me,’ she told the tribunal. ‘I feel I have been classed as a rapist.' But the company claimed she had . deliberately attempted to humiliate and demean the male assistant. Miss . Daley said she was bending over a desk doing a time sheet in the office . when the man slapped her bottom ‘quite hard’ and laughed. She told him: ‘Don’t do that. I will . get you back later.’ Miss Daley didn’t complain, but made good her . promise later that day in the laundry room. She said she undid one press stud on . his uniform tunic as he fended her off with a laundry basket. The man . said Miss Daley undid three buttons. 'It was not a nice experience and seemed to go on for ages. It scared me - they are not small lasses.' Victim . Miss Daley said she was just teasing . him and that ‘banter and horseplay’ was common among staff. She said . that after undoing a button she told him: ‘I have got you back for . slapping my bum earlier.’ She said: ‘I didn’t attack him, I just undid a . press stud.’ Miss Daley said she did not know her . friend was filming or that she had talked of putting the footage on . YouTube. ‘It was just banter and harmless fun,’ she said. But the man told bosses he was left ‘uncomfortable, shocked, scared, on edge and nervous’. The victim told investigators: ‘It was . not a nice experience and seemed to go on for ages. It scared me – they . are not small lasses.’ He claimed Miss Bartrop egged on Miss . Daley, from Mexborough, South Yorkshire, and he was frightened it might . have gone further. The victim said: ‘What started out as a laugh got out . of hand and has made me quite nervous.’ He claimed he had been humiliated and . the incident in April had left him working in a ‘hostile, degrading and . offensive’ environment. The care home company said the incident breached . its code of respect and its equality and diversity policy among its . workforce. Employment judge Martin Howard . described it as an ‘unfortunate case’ and said he had ‘sympathy’ with . the claimant. However, he concluded the home had fair and reasonable . grounds to dismiss Miss Daley.       1\n",

Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, seen in a December sketch, was waterboarded 183 times in a month, a memo says. The controversial technique that simulates drowning -- and which President Obama calls torture -- was used at least 83 times in August 2002 on suspected al Qaeda leader Abu Zubaydah, according to the memo. Interrogators also waterboarded Khalid Sheikh Mohammed 183 times in March 2003. Mohammed is believed to be the mastermind behind the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States. Obama released the memo Thursday, saying that \"exceptional circumstances surround these memos and require their release.\"  Watch other tactics outlined in memos » . The memo, dated May 30, 2005, was from then-Deputy Assistant Attorney General Steven G. Bradbury to John Rizzo, who was acting general counsel for the CIA. It paints a different picture from the one described by former CIA officer John Kiriakou. In a December 2007 interview with CNN, Kiriakou said Zubaydah had been waterboarded for \"about 30 seconds, 35 seconds\" and agreed to cooperate with interrogators the following day. In an interview on \"Fox News Sunday,\" Michael Hayden, who directed the CIA from 2006 to 2009, was asked about the number of times Mohammed was waterboarded. Hayden denounced the release of the memos and did not comment on the number, saying it was his understanding that the frequency of waterboarding was among the operational details that had not been declassified.  Watch one expert say tactics 'worse than Abu Ghraib' » . The 2005 memo refers to a letter that had contained the numbers as well. Part of the reference to the letter was redacted in the released memo. Waterboarding is among the interrogation tactics that Obama has prohibited through an executive order. The CIA also has admitted waterboarding Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, the first person charged in the United States for the 2000 attack on the USS Cole in Yemen that killed 17 U.S. sailors. Obama said last week he felt comfortable releasing the classified memos because the Bush administration acknowledged using some of the practices associated with the memos, and the interrogation techniques were widely reported and have since been banned. \"Withholding these memos would only serve to deny facts that have been in the public domain for some time,\" Obama said in a statement. \"This could contribute to an inaccurate accounting of the past, and fuel erroneous and inflammatory assumptions about actions taken by the United States.\" The president applauded the work of the U.S. intelligence community and said no one who \"carried out their duties relying in good faith upon legal advice from the Department of Justice\" would be prosecuted.</th>\n",

              "      <th>(CNN) -- Basketball commentator and former hoops star Charles Barkley was arrested Wednesday in Scottsdale, Arizona, on suspicion of drunken driving, a police spokesman said. Charles Barkley was driving an Infiniti SUV through a trendy area of Scottsdale on Wednesday, police say. Barkley issued a brief statement, saying, \"I am disappointed that I put myself in that situation. The Scottsdale police were fantastic. I will not comment any further as it is a legal matter.\" Lt. Eric Shuhandler of the Gilbert Police Department said an officer pulled Barkley over after he ran a stop sign in Scottsdale's Old Town area, a trendy spot known for its nightclubs and bars. Gilbert and Scottsdale are in the Phoenix metro area. \"The officer identified the driver of the 2005 Infiniti as Charles Barkley,\" according to a written statement from police. \"Mr. Barkley was administered the standard field sobriety tests after the odor of intoxicating liquor was detected.\"  Watch: Barkley 'disappointed' by arrest » . At a news conference later in the day, Shuhandler said Barkley's \"performance on the field sobriety test revealed there was probable cause to make an arrest.\" Barkley declined to take a breath test to measure his blood-alcohol level, Shuhandler said earlier. \"When he arrived at the station, police administered a blood test, which is customary of our police department to do,\" he said, adding that Barkley consented to the blood test. It will take \"a few days\" for the crime lab to test the blood sample and determine Barkley's blood-alcohol level, Shuhandler said. The former NBA power forward was cited for driving while impaired and released. \"It was a pretty routine arrest,\" Shuhandler said. Barkley's sport-utility vehicle was impounded under mandatory vehicle impound laws, police said. Shuhandler said Barkley behaved professionally during the booking and was \"very respectful and cordial with our officers.\"  Watch Shuhandler describe the arrest » . Barkley, 45, is a commentator for TNT's coverage of the NBA. In October, he told CNN's Campbell Brown that he plans to run for governor of his home state of Alabama in 2014, saying, \"I can't screw up Alabama. We are number 48 in everything and Arkansas and Mississippi aren't going anywhere.\" Although he is well known for entertaining comments and a cocky attitude, he also compiled an impressive résumé as a professional basketball player. A Hall of Famer and 11-time All-Star, Barkley is one of four players in history to rack up more than 20,000 points, 10,000 rebounds and 4,000 assists in a career. He also earned the NBA's most valuable player designation in 1993 and brought home gold medals with the U.S. Olympic basketball team in 1992 and 1996. His commanding performance on the court earned him the nicknames \"Sir Charles\" and the \"Round Mound of Rebound.\" Barkley was drafted out of Auburn University in 1984 by the Philadelphia 76ers and played 16 seasons with the Sixers, Phoenix Suns and Houston Rockets before he was permanently sidelined in 1999 with a ruptured tendon in his left knee. TNT is owned by Turner Broadcasting Corp., also the parent company of CNN. CNN's Nick Valencia contributed to this report.</th>\n",

Gareth Southgate's Young Lions take on Croatia in the first leg of their play-off at Molineux on Friday night and head into the match in fine form having won nine of their 10 group games. But former England and Manchester United midfielder Scholes writes in his Independent column that there needs to be a culture change if England are to succeed at Under 21 level. Jack Wilshere - man of the match against San Marino - will be eligible to play for the Under 21s next summer . Liverpool attacker Raheem Sterling should also go the European Under 21 Championship, says Paul Scholes . 'There are too many young players who, having made a senior debut, see a move to the Under 21s as a demotion,' Scholes argues. 'Calum Chambers is a prime example. He went from the Under 19s to the senior team. Then he was in the Under 21s squad this week until the injury to John Stones meant that he returned to the seniors. 'I have no reason to doubt that Chambers would have taken the Under 21s seriously. But if any player needs a reminder, they only have to look as far as Juan Mata. He was part of the Spain squad that won the World Cup in 2010 in South Africa and then went back to the Under-21s the following summer and won the European Championship. Manchester United playmaker Juan Mata celebrates with the World Cup trophy in 2010 . Mata with his Bronze Boot award after helping Spain to the European Under 21 title in Denmark in 2011 . Scholes says that Calum Chambers (above) should not consider an Under 21s call-up a demotion . 'If it is good enough for Mata, why not English lads, too? Should Southgate’s team make it to the tournament, I would advocate taking Raheem Sterling and Jack Wilshere to the tournament next summer, even though they are well-established in the senior team.' Scholes highlights the counter-argument to his point; namely that dropping players who had played in qualifiers for those who haven't would be inherently unfair. But he retorts: 'Does the Football Association want to win something? If the answer is 'Yes', then it is time to be ruthless about getting the best team on the pitch.' Scholes played 66 times for England but never made an appearances for the Under 21s .</th>\n",

Sandra Samuel bravely saved the life of Moshe Holtzberg, 2, but says she sees no heroism in her actions. But Sandra Samuel sees no heroism in her actions amid last week's terror attacks on India's financial capital that killed nearly 180 people -- including baby Moshe's parents, Rabbi Gavriel Holtzberg and his wife, Rivka. She only wishes she could have done more. \"Even today, I am thinking I should have sent the baby and done something for the rabbi and his wife,\" Samuel told CNN in an exclusive television interview in Israel, where she now lives. Samuel and Moshe were among the few to make it out of the Chabad House alive after gunmen stormed the Jewish center, killing the Holtzbergs and four others. Israel's Chabad movement has set up a fund to provide for Moshe's care. He is being looked after by members of the community, although who will serve as his guardian has not yet been established. The nanny says she came face to face with a gunman late Wednesday, the first night of the siege. \"I saw one man was shooting at me -- he shot at me.\"  Watch CNN's Paula Hancocks talk with Samuel » . She slammed a door and hid in a first-floor storage room and attempted to reach the rabbi and the others on the second floor. Overnight, Samuel frantically tried to call for help as gunfire and grenade blasts shook the Chabad House. Samuel says she emerged early the next afternoon, when she heard Moshe calling for her. She found the child crying as he stood between his parents, who she says appeared unconscious but still alive. Based on the marks on Moshe's back, she believes he was struck so hard by a gunman that he fell unconscious at some point as well. \"First thing is that a baby is very important for me and this baby is something very precious to me and that's what made me just not think anything -- just pick up the baby and run,\" Samuel said. \"When I hear gunshot, it's not one or 20. It's like a hundred gunshots,\" she added. \"Even I'm a mother of two children so I just pick up the baby and run. Does anyone think of dying at the moment when there's a small, precious baby?\"  Watch Samuel describe the escape » . Outside, chaos flooded the streets as people tried to make sense of the massacre that killed at least 179 people and wounded 300 others. Ultimately, she and Moshe reached safety at the home of an Israeli consul before arriving in Israel, where she is considered a hero. In the aftermath of the attacks, Moshe asked for his mother continuously, Samuel says, and he is learning to play again -- though he likes the nanny close by. And while she still has nightmares of the horrific siege that took hold of Mumbai, Samuel, a non-Jew and native of India, said she will stay in Israel for as long as Moshe needs her.

The discounts are due to the current strength of the pound, which has hit $1.70 for the first time since 2009.

Gadgets including the Xbox One were also much cheaper . A study by British Airways compared the price of dozens of products and found clothes and make-up also to be far cheaper abroad. Ugg boots cost £60 less in the US, while some Victoria’s Secret items are up to £30 cheaper across the Atlantic. Nike ID trainers are also 41 per cent cheaper in the US than the UK. British Airways said the potential for huge savings made America the top destination this summer for British holidaymakers, with New York deemed the best for stocking up on goods. Claire Bentley, managing director of British Airways Holidays, said: ‘New York is one of the best places in the world to go shopping, especially now you can literally get more bang for your buck. ‘If you’re thrifty enough, the savings you can make could even pay for your trip.’ Many large US department stores are also known to offer further discounts in an attempt to attract international visitors, with Macy’s offering shoppers an additional ten per cent off. The findings come after it was revealed British shoppers are also paying as much as 60 per cent more for high street fashion brands than the rest of Europe. Retail figures revealed global chains including H&amp;M, Zara and Mango hike up prices for their UK customers. New York is one of the top destinations for British shoppers looking for bargains, with many department stores offering further discounts to international visitors, with Macy's offering shoppers an additional ten per cent off . A snapshot survey of 20 items sold by major chains in 14 countries showed the UK to be more expensive than Spain, the US, Greece, Italy, Ireland and Poland. A Zara tunic dress on sale for £49.20 in Spain cost more than £20 more in the UK while t-shirts from the same store worked out to be more than double the price in Britain. Researchers for foreign currency firm Caxton FX found the average UK mark-up for items from the international stores was 18 per cent. The only country which was consistently more expensive than the UK was Switzerland. Global fashion chains typically claim their prices are higher in the UK because rent, rates, staff costs and taxes are higher. But analyst Neil Saunders, from retail consultancy Conlumino, said last month: ‘Retailers will look at each individual country to see what consumers are willing to pay. If they can charge more in the UK, they will.’</th>\n",

Baldwin and a New Orleans businessman say Costner and others tricked them into selling their stock in a company that made oil spill cleanup machines the same week BP placed a $52 million order for the technology. Read the Baldwin vs. Costner complaint (PDF) Read the trial memo (PDF) The judge has ordered both actors to attend each day of the trial, which is being heard in a federal court in New Orleans. The oil separation technology was developed in the 1990s by a company created by Costner, but Baldwin became involved while in New Orleans to produce a documentary about the Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico in May 2010. Video: Costner's plea to save the Gulf . Baldwin and Spyridon Contogouris decided to sell their stock soon after getting it because of differences with other shareholders, according to the lawsuit. They signed an agreement to sell their shares to Patrick Smith, who then transferred them to a company partly owned by Costner, on June 11, 2010. BP announced on June 15, 2010, it would lease 32 machines from the company. Lessons lingering from oil spill . If Smith and Costner had told them BP was placing a huge order, they would not have sold, the suit said. The 10% of the company that Baldwin sold for $500,000 should have been worth $3.8 million, while the 28% stake sold by Contogouris for $1.4 million was worth $10.6 million, the suit said. Lawyers for Costner and Smith contend Baldwin and Contogouris sold their stock \"with eyes wide open, to get out of a soured business relationship and to invest in other ventures.\" Video: Can Costner clean up the spill? They knew that BP might place the order, a defense filing said. It was widely reported in the news and Costner testified about it to Congress two days before the stock sale. Contrary to trying to trick Baldwin into selling his shares, Costner was \"dumbfounded,\" \"flabbergasted\" and \"furious\" when he learned Baldwin and Contogouris had sold out \"because it enabled plaintiffs to cash out their interests\" before the company had earned any money, the defense filing said.

              "      <th>True or false? Andrea Rossi, pictured, says he has built a machine achieving 'cold fusion'  but scientists question if it is possible . An Italian physicist claims he has managed to achieve 'cold fusion' - a procedure that could solve the world's energy crisis by creating huge amounts of safe nuclear energy without dangerous radiation. Andrea Rossi says his new machine fuses nickel and hydrogen at room temperature creating almost unlimited energy. But there is one problem - many scientists claim it defies the very laws of physics. Several high-profile demonstrations of 'cold fusion' have been proven to be hoaxes in the past - and no one can adequately explain how or why it might work. The United States Department of Energy the U.S. Patent Office say the process is impossible because physics rules out the possibility of room-temperature nuclear fusion. But Rossi's E-Cat machine can allegedly do it, and he says he proved it worked during tests at the University of Bologna last month. 'With low energy, it's possible to give a heater a certain amount of energy and to get from the same heater a superior amount of energy,' he said. 'The heat is initiated by electrical resistance. The reactors then produce another 479kWh of energy for another three to four hours without needing that initial electrical input -- the low-level nuclear reaction continues on its own. Machine: Professor Rossi's E-Cat was tested last month and produced huge amounts of non-radioactive energy, he says . Key: Rossi says he has produced a pattern of triple track atoms, pictured, which is at the heart of the cold fusion theory . 'The test we made by the customer was to see if the process was working properly, and to control whether the energy was in an amount superior to the amount supplied to the system. 'We have nothing to say, just to make plans that work properly and let those facts win against the scepticism.' The idea of cold fusion was put forward by in the 1920s by Austrian scientists Friedrich Paneth and Kurt Peters. But despite several people saying they have done it, it has been dismissed by most physicists. An atom is a nucleus of protons and neutrons, with electrons orbiting around . Scientists say that Rossi's claims must be taken from his lab and analysed before he can claim he has done it. Energy consultant Jonathan Koomey said '[The E-Cat experiment] should be treated as a hoax until independent scientists are able to replicate these results,' But Sterling Allan, CEO of the alternative energy news agency Pure Energy Systems, told FoxNews.com he attended Rossi’s demonstration and the E-Cat is self sustaining. 'What Rossi demonstrated was 470 kilowatts of continuous output in self-sustain mode -- meaning the output was enough to keep the thing running on its own,' he said.</th>\n",

When a male colleague playfully slapped her behind as she bent over a desk, care assistant Kelly Daley laughed it off as horseplay. Unfortunately, when she decided to take ‘playful’ revenge by confronting him in the care home laundry room and undoing buttons on his uniform, he didn’t see the funny side. The man reported Miss Daley, 29, to management for bullying and sexual harassment, claiming his dignity was ‘violated’, an employment tribunal was told. It was also claimed she grabbed his genitals – which she strongly denied. 'Just harmless fun': Care worker Kelly Daley (pictured) was sacked after she undid the top buttons of a male colleague's uniform as a joke while another worker filmed it . Miss Daley and fellow carer Gemma . Bartrop, 27, who filmed the button incident on her mobile phone, were . sacked for gross misconduct. A female nurse who viewed the footage was . also given a final written warning. However, the man, who had previously . slapped both their bottoms in similar incidents, escaped with a ticking . off. He was also granted the legal right to . anonymity after the Sheffield tribunal decided the incident should be . treated like a sexual offence. Miss Daley claimed unfair dismissal . against the owners of the privately-run home in Rotherham, South . Yorkshire, but lost her case. She had worked at the home for more than eight years and had a previously unblemished record. ‘I feel he has been treated far more leniently than me,’ she told the tribunal. ‘I feel I have been classed as a rapist.' But the company claimed she had . deliberately attempted to humiliate and demean the male assistant. Miss . Daley said she was bending over a desk doing a time sheet in the office . when the man slapped her bottom ‘quite hard’ and laughed. She told him: ‘Don’t do that. I will . get you back later.’ Miss Daley didn’t complain, but made good her . promise later that day in the laundry room. She said she undid one press stud on . his uniform tunic as he fended her off with a laundry basket. The man . said Miss Daley undid three buttons. 'It was not a nice experience and seemed to go on for ages. It scared me - they are not small lasses.' Victim . Miss Daley said she was just teasing . him and that ‘banter and horseplay’ was common among staff. She said . that after undoing a button she told him: ‘I have got you back for . slapping my bum earlier.’ She said: ‘I didn’t attack him, I just undid a . press stud.’ Miss Daley said she did not know her . friend was filming or that she had talked of putting the footage on . YouTube. ‘It was just banter and harmless fun,’ she said. But the man told bosses he was left ‘uncomfortable, shocked, scared, on edge and nervous’. The victim told investigators: ‘It was . not a nice experience and seemed to go on for ages. It scared me – they . are not small lasses.’ He claimed Miss Bartrop egged on Miss . Daley, from Mexborough, South Yorkshire, and he was frightened it might . have gone further. The victim said: ‘What started out as a laugh got out . of hand and has made me quite nervous.’ He claimed he had been humiliated and . the incident in April had left him working in a ‘hostile, degrading and . offensive’ environment. The care home company said the incident breached . its code of respect and its equality and diversity policy among its . workforce. Employment judge Martin Howard . described it as an ‘unfortunate case’ and said he had ‘sympathy’ with . the claimant.
